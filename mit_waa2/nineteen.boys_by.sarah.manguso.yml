- But he remembered me.
- |
  

- So you're so-and-so from so-and-so  as if he had been thinking about me lately.
- |
  

- He was a drug dealer and we were sitting next to each other on a bed.
- |
  

- Someone was lying underneath it, tying his shoelaces together.
- |
  

- He whispered something in my ear and I turned my head toward him quickly.
- |
  

- At the advice of friends, I invited him to the Christmas Cotillion.
- |
  

- I ate salad for dinner and he ordered a garden salad, not realizing that there weren't going to be any more courses.
- |
  

- I saw him a few times afterward and wanted to apologize every time.
