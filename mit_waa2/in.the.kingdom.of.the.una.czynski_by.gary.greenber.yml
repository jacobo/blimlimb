- "Background: In 1998, Gary Greenberg, a psychotherapist living in rural Connecticut, began a correspondence with Ted Kaczynski, the murderer known as the Unabomber."
- |
  

- He and Kaczynski exchanged dozens of letters, with some of Kaczynski's as long as 20 pages.
- |
  

- In the letters, they discussed the insidious influence of technology, the preservation of wild nature, the dubious claims and conclusions of the psychiatric profession, the appetites and proclivities of the American media, Kaczynski's life in prison, the choices made by Kaczynski's family, and the lessons of Russian feudalism.
- In a wide-ranging essay, Greenberg discusses the evolution and dissolution of his relationship with Kaczynski, along the way eviscerating the media that courted and then devoured the Unabomber, the judicial system that did everything possible to avoid another O.J.
- |
  

- Kaczynski's principles by labeling them as paranoid schizophrenia.
- "Please note: a) This story is absolutely real; b) The excerpts being presented comprise only a portion of Mr. Greenberg's article, which in its entirety is 23,000 words or so; c) The order of the excerpts is not necessarily the same as that in the print version."
- "Part I: Please Forgive My Intrusion Into Your Life"

- |
  

- At this point in our story, Greenberg has secured a contract with a  national magazine he calls Glossy, and Kaczynski has indicated that he  will give Greenberg an interview for the article.
- |
  

- This will be the  first interview Kaczynski gives.
- |
  

- If there was a moment when I understood what it might mean to secure my  Unabomber franchise, it was when I spoke with Serena.
- Serena wasn't the first agent I'd had truck with.
- |
  

- A young agent from a  large New York agency had called me in September, having caught wind,  through a mutual friend, of my bid for the Unabomber franchise.
- |
  

- We'd  gone to lunch at a swank Midtown place.
- |
  

- He was a smart man who was  interested in Kaczynski as a cultural phenomenon as well as a business  opportunity.
- |
  

- He didn't glaze over when I talked about antimodernism and  the Luddites and Thoreau, even countered with some thoughts of his own  about the relationship between art and violence.
- |
  

- Business only came up  as the hovering waiter removed our empty plates.
- |
  

- A book would be great.
- |
  

- And, having heard the story of Kaczynski's planned appeal, he suggested  that an article for an outlet like The New York Times Magazine, about  the problems of the plea bargain, would be an easy sell around the time the appeal was filed.
- |
  

- "He had only two caveats: this story had legs, but they wouldn't run  forever; and without face time, I didn't really have anything an agent  could sell."
- He paid for lunch, 75 bucks or so.
- |
  

- So far, that is the entire  remuneration my Unabomber franchise has yielded.
- |
  

- The food was delicious.
- It turned out he couldn't be my agent.
- |
  

- His agency had a conflict.
- |
  

- It  represented a real reporter with an interest in the Unabomber story.
- |
  

- Since it seemed that I had no need of an agent until I had secured an  audience with Kaczynski, I decided to search no further.
- |
  

- But just after  I got my invitation, Glossy started to play its hand in a way that made  me rethink this decision.
- |
  

- My editor emailed me, using our shorthand for  Kaczynski's name.
- |
  

- "As I've continued to think about this piece, I think I've hit upon a  strategy that may work best for all parties involved: a straight,  lengthy Q&A, bracketed by an intro and conclusion by you."
- |
  

- I like this  because it gives the reader what he/she really wants, which is to hear  TK himself speak, and also because it will allow you to focus more of  your attention on the conversation itself, drawing him out, letting him  speak, and less on trying to come up with a narrative strategy.
- |
  

- Of  course, quite a bit depends on what TK says in the interview.
- |
  

- But as we  get closer to the event, let's discuss this.
- He may well have thought this strategy would truly serve all of us, or  at least that his touch was deft.
- |
  

- He may have thought I would be  relieved not to have to trouble my pretty little head with narrative  strategies, or at least that I wouldn't detect the condescension of his  email.
- |
  

- "But his meaning could not have been more clear: I was useful to  Glossy only to the extent that I could get to see Ted Kaczynski on their  nickel, and once I'd done that, my job was to stay out of the way."
- I was in high dudgeon, not yet smart enough to realize that I had  merely discovered gambling in Casablanca.
- |
  

- Hadn't I told them what I  wanted to do?
- |
  

- What about my long and thoughtful memoir?
- |
  

- A Q&A indeed!
- |
  

- They wanted me to pimp for the Unabomber!
- |
  

- Of course, this wasn't entirely a surprise.
- |
  

- From the beginning, my  editor had made his concerns clear.
- |
  

- "\"I think we ought to start talking  about the article,\""
- |
  

- "\"You know, get some sense of where you're going to take  this thing."
- So I gave him that day's riff on the Unabomber, which was all the  strange symmetry in his life.
- |
  

- Kaczynski's worst nightmare wasn't getting  caught; it was getting caught and then called a nutcase, which is  exactly what happened.
- |
  

- And then the fact that he'd predicted it, through  some fairly sophisticated analysis of the psychiatric profession, became  more evidence that he was crazy.
- |
  

- He hated technology, and the prison he  ended up in is the most technologically advanced prison ever built, not  to mention that his cell is about the same size as his shack in the  woods.
- |
  

- There's something vicious about all this self-fulfilling  prophecy, I told the editor, vicious like Blake's Tyger.
- He was silent for a moment.
- |
  

- But he wasn't mulling over Blake.
- |
  

- "\"You  know, I've been thinking about this piece too."
- |
  

- And I keep remembering  Tom Snyder's interview of Charles Manson.
- |
  

- All I really wanted to see was  Manson, you know, what was he like and all that.
- |
  

- And this asshole with a  good haircut kept getting in the way.
- |
  

- It was like he thought he was more  important than Manson.
- |
  

- We really want to avoid that kind of a  situation.
- So I guess I should have known they weren't terribly interested in what  I had to say.
- |
  

- More to the point, and speaking of fearful symmetries, I  suppose shouldn't have expected to reap anything other than what I  sowed.
- |
  

- They hadn't, after all, responded to my query because it was  well-written.
- But still.
- I took out my contract.
- |
  

- What really worried me was the part about how  they had "the right to adapt, crop, enhance, change, and edit the Work.
- "\"  Did this mean they could reassemble my words as they saw fit, to make  sure the article gave the readers what they really wanted?"
- I called a lawyer, a New York lawyer.
- |
  

- "\"You signed a contract?"
- "\" he said,  graciously leaving off his suffix: \""
- You fucking moron.
- "\" I read him the  clause in question."
- |
  

- He told me he'd have to see the whole thing to be  sure, but that they probably had more latitude than I wanted them to  have.
- |
  

- His advice was either to give Glossy what they wanted or something  they couldn't use at all, and then go on to write the article I was  interested in for someone else.
- That seemed like good counsel, but it also worried me.
- |
  

- What if Glossy  did such a hatchet job that they destroyed my connection with Kaczynski?
- |
  

- What would happen to my franchise then?
- |
  

- And it would be a shame if  all the fruit of my labor were a Q&A with my byline squeezed into the  corner of Kaczynski's beard.
- Enter Serena.
- |
  

- She was the agent of a friend of mine.
- |
  

- She spared me the  lawyer's tact.
- |
  

- "\"Look,\""
- |
  

- "\"If you let Glossy publish this, it's  just going to hurt you."
- |
  

- They're not even a top-tier magazine, and  they're trying to squeeze you out.
- |
  

- Anyone can see that.
- |
  

- Fuck Glossy.
- "\"But the contract."
- "\"Fuck the contract, too."
- |
  

- You've got something here.
- |
  

- So this is what you  do.
- |
  

- Put together a book proposal.
- |
  

- Doesn't matter who writes the thing&nbsp;--   you can, or I can find someone else to.
- |
  

- Then a month before the book  comes out you put an excerpt in Vanity Fair.
- |
  

- Then when the book  comes out, you've got a bestseller.
- |
  

- You can't let some second- or  third-tier magazine&nbsp;-- and they're not even at the top of their tier&nbsp;--   blow this for you.
- Oh, Serena!
- |
  

- Sweet co-conspirator, blowing bestseller kisses into my  ears and spanking me at the very same time.
- |
  

- Fucking Glossy with me, a  menage-a-trois.
- |
  

- Concupiscence made me weak in the knees.
- |
  

- I mean that  literally&nbsp;-- the part about my knees going weak.
- |
  

- When Serena unveiled her  plans for me, I swooned for a moment.
- |
  

- This was my big chance.
- |
  

- Serena was  going to show me how it was done, New York style.
- In the movie version of this story, I say to Serena, "But, darling, how  do we know this is a bestseller when it isn't even written yet?
- |
  

- And what  happens when I decide I don't like my contract with you?
- "\" and ride off  into the sunset with principle between my knees."
- |
  

- Real life being what it  is, however, I told Serena I'd have to think about all this.
- |
  

- "\"Well, if  you like,\""
- |
  

- It wasn't so much the prospect of dishonoring my contract with Glossy  that worried me.
- |
  

- I could probably have justified that.
- |
  

- "The more  disturbing thing was the prospect of becoming the person Serena thought  I should be: the kind who lets someone else write his book proposals,  who types his book with one eye on his bank account and the other on The  New York Times bestseller list, who writes in disregard of all the  assurances he's given his subject (and himself) about exploitation and  pandering."
- Which doesn't mean I wouldn't have liked to see my name on the  Bestseller List.
- |
  

- There were just things I couldn't do to get there, or  so I thought.
- |
  

- But I'll never know how much of a scoundrel I really am.
- |
  

- Because not long after I decided that I really couldn't be the kind of   person Serena wanted me to be, and before I could reconsider that  decision, matters were taken out of my hands.

  If there was a moment when I understood what it might mean to secure my

  Serena wasn't the first agent I'd had truck with. A young agent from a
   large New York agency had called me in September, having caught wind,

   gone to lunch at a swank Midtown place. He was a smart man who was

  It turned out he couldn't be my agent. His agency had a conflict. It

   Since it seemed that I had no need of an agent until I had secured an

   I got my invitation, Glossy started to play its hand in a way that made
   me rethink this decision. My editor emailed me, using our shorthand for
   Kaczynski's name.
  
    As I've continued to think about this piece, I think I've hit upon a
   strategy that may work best for all parties involved: a straight,
   lengthy Q&A, bracketed by an intro and conclusion by you. I like this
   because it gives the reader what he/she really wants, which is to hear
   TK himself speak, and also because it will allow you to focus more of
   your attention on the conversation itself, drawing him out, letting him

   strategies, or at least that I wouldn't detect the condescension of his

   Glossy only to the extent that I could get to see Ted Kaczynski on their

  That seemed like good counsel, but it also worried me. What if Glossy
   did such a hatchet job that they destroyed my connection with Kaczynski?
   What would happen to my franchise then? $10,000 was a lot of money to
   me, but it was chump change to anyone else. And it would be a shame if
   all the fruit of my labor were a Q&A with my byline squeezed into the
   corner of Kaczynski's beard.
  Enter Serena. She was the agent of a friend of mine. She spared me the

   is, however, I told Serena I'd have to think about all this. "Well, if
   you like," she said, obviously exasperated with my dithering at such a
   critical time.
  It wasn't so much the prospect of dishonoring my contract with Glossy
   that worried me. I could probably have justified that. The more
   disturbing thing was the prospect of becoming the person Serena thought
   I should be: the kind who lets someone else write his book proposals,
