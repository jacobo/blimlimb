- The interview took place in December 2000.
- |
  

- "Q: So, what are you in for sounds like a bad pickup line, but what are you in for?"
- "Williams: I'm an addict and I got caught writing phony prescriptions for painkillers."
- "Q: How many times?"
- "Williams: How many times did I get fake scrips or how many times did I get caught?"
- "Q: Uhh, how many times did you get caught?"
- "Williams: How many counts or how many arrests?"
- "Q: Both, I guess."
- "Williams: (Deep sigh) I was arrested five different times."
- |
  

- I had a total of seventy-four counts against me but my lawyer got the counts down to three.
- "Q: Impressive lawyer!"
- "Williams: If you think that's impressive, think about this for a second."
- |
  

- It took them five years before they caught on that I was doing the shit.
- |
  

- Think about that, dude!
- "Q: So you're pretty crafty."
- "Williams: Shoot."
- "Q: When will you be getting out?"
- "Williams: My release date is June 29, 2002."
- "Q: How long have you been in?"
- "Williams: The better question is how long have I been out."
- |
  

- In the past two years I've been out for a total of six weeks.
- |
  

- My sobriety never lasted too long.
- |
  

- I was using two days after my release last time.
- "Q: What pisses you off about being in here?"
- "Williams: They put the dildo maker in the hole for supposedly making weapons."
- |
  

- They were dildos, man!
- |
  

- And they won't let us have magazines or newspapers in here.
- |
  

- The TV is always on some stupid rerun so I have no idea what's going on in the world.
- "Q: So you like to keep abreast of current events?"
- "Williams: Used to, being here is making me lose IQ points by the day."
- "Q: Too little stimulation?"
- "Williams: Yeah, especially now that the dildo maker's in the hole."
- "Q: Can you give me an idea of what a typical day is like for you here in Marysville?"
- "Williams: When you first get here you got to be careful."
- "Q: How so?"
- "Williams: Well, there's so many stupid rules and if you break them you can end up in the hole."
- "Q: Can you explain what the hole is and give me an example?"
- "Williams: The hole is solitary confinement."
- |
  

- When I first got here a girl was thrown in the hole for fourteen days for tapping a guard on the shoulder to get his attention.
- |
  

- Also, you can't call the guards guards.
- |
  

- You can get in trouble for that.
- |
  

- They make you call them C.O.
- |
  

- Plus things you may have brought in from the county are considered contraband and you can get in trouble for having it.
- |
  

- I had an ink pen that I bought while I was in the county waiting to be transferred here.
- |
  

- I could have been thrown in the hole for having it.
- |
  

- I could be thrown in the hole because my hair is too long and because I have my bellybutton pierced.
- "Q: You're not allowed to have ink pens?"
- "Williams: Oh sure, but they have to be purchased from this commissary."
- "Q: So they're running a racket?"
- "Williams: Basically, and it sucks for people without money."
- |
  

- They may have bought a bunch of shit in the county, but they aren't allowed to use any of it.
- |
  

- Do you know how many people use kitchen grease for their hair?
- |
  

- I had to for the first week I was in here because I didn't get to go to the commissary until the next week.
- "Q: Why would you put kitchen grease in your hair?"
- "Williams: Because when you have curly dry hair you have to use something or it will break and you can't brush it."
- "Q: So, what are your days like?"
- "Williams: We get up real early and we have about fifty counts a day."
- |
  

- Basically, they do head counts to make sure nobody escaped.
- |
  

- When we have counts we have to be on our bunks.
- |
  

- I go outside for cigarettes and I sit on my bunk.
- |
  

- Some days I get to go to the commissary and buy things like snacks, hair supplies, a tape player with headphones, that sort of thing.
- |
  

- I had a job here cooking and that was good, but I got sick of it.
- |
  

- One thing that pisses me off is how they'll just lock up the bathroom for however long and if you tell them you have to pee they don't give a shit.
- |
  

- The other day this girl ended up pissing herself because the bathroom was locked for so long.
- "Q: Why do they lock up the bathroom?"
- "Williams: They just do every day for sometimes short times and sometimes long times."
- |
  

- I think they keep it locked when an inmate says she's got to pee just to fuck with her.
- "Q: Withholding bathroom privileges should be on the list of cruel and unusual punishments."
- "Williams: Prison is cruel and unusual."
- |
  

- I should be in rehab.
- |
  

- In county I bunked next to a woman that murdered her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend.
- |
  

- All I did was drug myself into numbness and ruin my life.
- |
  

- I don't belong with half these people.
- |
  

- A lot of the people in here are addicts and didn't hurt anyone.
- |
  

- Some of them stole shit to afford their habit but that's the extent of it.
- "Q: Why do they call it a reformatory?"
- "Williams: Good question, because nothing's getting reformed in here."
- |
  

- We're just waiting to get out, wasting our days away.
- "Q: What do you plan on doing when you get out?"
- "Williams: I'd like to see my daughter and get to know her again."
- |
  

- She's three and I've spent most of her life in lock up.
- |
  

- I'd like to be the mom she deserves.
- |
  

- I'd also like to have a girls' night out and go dancing.
- |
  

- I'd like to have a nice dinner and a glass of wine.
- |
  

- And I'd like to go shopping in New York City.
- |
  

- I've never been to New York City.
- "Q: Any long-range goals?"
- "Williams: I can't afford to have any long-range goals."
- "Q: Why not?"
- "Williams: Because I don't want to be disappointed when I fail."
- "Q: You don't have any hope?"
- "Williams: I have hope but I don't count on much, I never have."
- |
  

- A lot of the stuff I'd like to do that would give me hope is out of the question for now because I'm a felon.
- "Q: Like what?"
- "Williams: I'd like to go to college."
- |
  

- I know I'm smart.
- |
  

- There's no way a stupid person could get away with stuff I did for so long.
- |
  

- But they have a new law, and if you've had a drug conviction you can't get a student loan.
- |
  

- So, now I have to wait at least three years before I can go to school.
- |
  

- Pretty stupid if you ask me.
- |
  

- Going to school could help me stay sober.
- |
  

- I mean, I know being sober has to do with me, but I always liked learning.
- |
  

- Those times when I can't stand to be with myself, I could crack open my books and study.
- |
  

- It could be one of the things to motivate me and help me through the rough patches.
- |
  

- But now, I'm this big criminal and I don't deserve school.
- |
  

- Make it so I can't use my brain because I hated myself and did drugs.
- |
  

- Sure, that's going to help society and help me stay sober.
- "Q: Do you still hate yourself?"
- "Williams: I hate myself and want to cut my face and fat body, but then a C.O."
- |
  

- I'm not even a human, and it makes me want to say, "Fuck you, I'm better than you think.
- "\" Then I just think that there's a reason I'm in here."
- |
  

- And I think someday I'll have a story to tell, even if it's a story I only share with myself.
- "Q: Will it have a happy ending?"
- "Williams: In my fantasy it does."
- |
  

- But I don't really know, I may die before I get sober.
