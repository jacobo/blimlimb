- Maybe This Is
- Just the Way It Is.
- |
  

- It was a typical morning.
- |
  

- There were several workers going in and out of the kitchen to the alley.
- |
  

- The kitchen was small and cramped, so we'd use the alley for things like peeling vegetables, washing dishes and pots, that kind of thing.
- |
  

- I went out there a few times to throw out some hot water.
- |
  

- There was another worker nearby, a woman, who was washing dishes.
- |
  

- I didn't really take much notice of her at the time, but I remember that at one point she left the tub of dishes.
- |
  

- I wasn't paying attention.
- |
  

- She must have gone inside the kitchen or restaurant to get something.
- |
  

- After throwing some water out, I went back inside the kitchen to my stove.
- |
  

- "Suddenly everyone heard screaming\x97the woman came inside the kitchen, holding her hands up and screaming that her hands were burning with pain."
- Then she ran inside the restaurant and came back with the manager.
- |
  

- He had a really angry look on his face.
- |
  

- He started talking to the workers.
- |
  

- I could understand "Bleach .
- |
  

- "\" So I guessed he was saying that somebody had put bleach in the woman's bucket of dishwater and he wanted to know who'd done it."
- |
  

- Nobody said anything.
- |
  

- Several times he pointed to me, saying, "
- Was it you?
- "\" I could understand that much."
- Of course I just kept saying "It wasn't me" and "I don't know anything.
- "\" But he kept pointing and asking and I knew then he'd decided it was me."
- |
  

- "I didn't understand why, I hadn't done anything\x97but I noticed the woman had her eyes to the floor."
- |
  

- The manager saw me looking at her and he waved his hands about and said what I thought was "
- No, she wasn't the one who accused you.
- Still, he kept pointing at me and asking, "Was it you?
- |
  

- Was it you?
- "\" Maybe he thought if he kept at me I'd eventually admit it."
- |
  

- But I kept saying no, which made him angrier and angrier.
- |
  

- He started pushing me around, but I didn't fight back.
- |
  

- I just turned away and went back to my stove.
- |
  

- I just wanted to get back to work.
- "The next thing I knew I was getting struck from behind\x97at first I didn't know what was happening, but then I turned around and it was the manager hitting my back, my arms."
- |
  

- "I tried to defend myself, push him away, but it was difficult\x97the kitchen was so cramped I had no space to move."
- |
  

- I couldn't get out.
- |
  

- I was scared.
- |
  

- It seemed like a long time that he was hitting me.
- |
  

- There were five or six other workers in the kitchen.
- |
  

- Some of them stood and watched.
- |
  

- Others were carrying on with their work as if nothing was happening.
- |
  

- I think they wanted to help me, but were too afraid.
- |
  

- Even when you see something bad happening, you have to think of yourself.
- |
  

- These are just people you work with.
- |
  

- You get along just so you can work.
- |
  

- All you really care about is keeping your job.
- Then the manager grabbed a cleaver and started attacking me with it.
- |
  

- I couldn't believe what was happening.
- |
  

- It seemed like he really wanted to hurt me, but when he actually cut my hand open and saw all the blood, he just looked really scared and ran away.
- Maybe I passed out, because I can't remember exactly what happened next, except that the police arrived, and then an ambulance, and then I was in a hospital bed.
- |
  

- Everything after that is pretty vague, even now, months later.
- |
  

- I just know that the whole time I was in the hospital I was afraid that I'd lose the use of my hand.
- |
  

- At the same time, I was hopeful that the law would help me.
- |
  

- I thought, "The police, they'll do something.
- The people at the Kentucky hospital were very kind.
- |
  

- They didn't ask me to pay any medical bills.
- |
  

- They said it was a terrible thing that happened.
- |
  

- The doctor there cut my hand open and reconnected something, maybe the bone.
- |
  

- He warned me, "If you're not careful, you could lose the use of your hand.
- |
  

- And when it gets better, it's still not going to be 100 percent normal.
- While I was in the hospital, someone, maybe the police, arranged for a Putonghua-speaking lawyer to come and see me.
- |
  

- This lawyer said that the police had gone back to the restaurant and couldn't find the manager.
- |
  

- He also said the manager had a previous record, for assault, and that the police were still looking for him.
- |
  

- I wondered if I wasn't the first worker he had attacked.
- |
  

- The lawyer said that, for now, there was nothing else that could be done.
- After about two weeks, my hand was stabilized, but I still couldn't move any of my fingers.
- |
  

- I was in a bad situation.
- |
  

- I had no job, and the police still couldn't find the manager.
- |
  

- This made me feel hopeless about getting any kind of compensation; it also made me feel unsafe.
- |
  

- I didn't know what the manager was thinking, if he wanted to get revenge or something.
- |
  

- So I had no choice but to get my things together and buy a bus ticket for New York.
- Back in Chinatown, the first thing I did was go and see a man called Mr. Chen.
- |
  

- He works for a foundation that's known for helping Fujianese people a lot.
- |
  

- I told him about my problem and he said he'd try and do what he could.
- |
  

- Hopefully he can help me somehow.
- |
  

- Since the attack happened, three months ago, I've been out of work.
- |
  

- I can't handle a wok; I can't do anything.
- I don't know if the manager was ever found, or if he was charged or not.
- |
  

- I admit I still have some anger toward him.
- |
  

- I don't understand how you can treat another human being like this.
- |
  

- I have thought about finding my own lawyer here in New York.
- |
  

- So maybe I'll ask Mr. Chen.
- |
  

- Or maybe this is just the way it is.
- |
  

- Maybe you just have to accept things and get on with your life.
