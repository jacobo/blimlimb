- Dear MC Emmie-D,
- Let me first admit that last weekend's debacle was partially my fault.
- |
  

- My decision to sign you up for a rap battle with MC Killah Klawz was a bit premature, as we may have overestimated your familiarity with the genre.
- |
  

- Nevertheless, I thought we had enough lyrical ammo for you to at least hold your own up there, but obviously I was wrong.
- |
  

- With that said, I do think much of the blame falls on your shoulders.
- |
  

- Just what prompted that sartorial train wreck of yours?
- |
  

- I thought we agreed that you'd rock the peanut-butter Tims and the Fubu sweatsuit I had custom-fitted for you at Jimmy Jazz on West 125th.
- |
  

- "But no: you show up with your hair in a bun, rocking a Victorian brocade dress with a full front bodice, cartridge pleats, and a bunch of frills."
- |
  

- This kind of thing may be de rigueur up in Amherst, but we don't roll like that in Brooklyn.
- Then there's the issue of the battle itself.
- |
  

- Now, MC Killah Klawz can off top flow, but he's not unbeatable.
- |
  

- I mean, when he came at you with the whole agoraphobia angle, "This bitch ain't left the house / since 1845 .
- |
  

- "\" I thought you might reply with something about his \""
- |
  

- "\" or all his illegitimate babies, but instead you inexplicably spit back:     Because I could not stop for Death\x97"
- "He kindly stopped for me [this actually sounded kind of promising at first]\x97"
- "The Carriage held but just Ourselves\x97"
- And Immortality.
- Carriages?
- |
  

- What does that mean?
- |
  

- You didn't even try to step to him.
- |
  

- Just you and Death riding around in some carriage.
- |
  

- You could have at least had the carriage rolling on 20s.
- Even with Round One going to MC Killah Klawz, I thought you'd eventually step up like a champion.
- |
  

- Instead, you just droned on about flies buzzing when you died, as if you were off in your own private world.
- |
  

- Were you trippin', Emily?
- |
  

- Didn't you remember what I said?
- |
  

- "I said to win a rap battle you needed three things: metaphors, disses, and humor."
- |
  

- It's a pretty easy formula.
- |
  

- All we had to do was flip the script on Killah Klawz and we could have salvaged some dignity and walked out of there with our heads held high.
- |
  

- "Instead, you dropped:    The Dews drew quivering and chill\x97"
- "For only Gossamer, my Gown\x97"
- "My Tippet\x97only Tulle."
- What the hell was that?
- |
  

- "\"Tippets\""
- |
  

- "\"Tulles\""
- |
  

- Are those, like, rival gangs in Amherst, or did you just panic up there?
- |
  

- "You also may be the only person ever to reference \"dew\" in a rap battle. Your extempore anecdotes recalling your time at Mount Holyoke weren't quite the hit you thought they were, either. Let's face it: the whole thing was a total disaster."
- Emily, I like you.
- |
  

- I really do.
- |
  

- I think you have a fertile mind and may one day make a name for yourself on the spoken-word circuit, but the rap game clearly is not for you.
- |
  

- I apologize for trying to rush you out there with all the hype and the lights and the pressure.
- |
  

- I also think we could have come up with a much better rap handle than "MC Emmie-D.
- "\") Simply put, you weren't ready, and for that I apologize."
- |
  

- I will, of course, waive my fee and wish you the best in all your future endeavors.
- It was great getting to know you, and I really do hope our paths cross again sometime soon.
- |
  

- Please take this week's break in correspondence as nothing more than a simple attempt on my part to "regroup.

  Let me first admit that last weekend's debacle was partially my fault.

  P.S. This past week, I've been working with a young rapper named Sylvia Plath. She's a little rough around the edges and definitely volatile, but I think she's got some real potential. Sylvia (MC Sylvie-P?) has got a battle coming up in a week, and I think you might really enjoy it.
