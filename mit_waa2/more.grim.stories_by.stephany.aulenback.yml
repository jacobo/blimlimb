- Once upon a time there lived an old man who was blind and deaf and whose hands trembled.
- |
  

- He could hardly hold his spoon and whenever he took a mouthful of soup, some of it would run out over his chin.
- |
  

- His son's wife was disgusted by this, so she made the old man sit in the corner behind the woodstove.
- |
  

- There's no room for people to sit behind modern-day stoves.
- |
  

- That's what nursing homes are for.
- A jealous queen commanded her huntsmen to take her beautiful stepdaughter, the princess, into the forest and kill her.
- |
  

- The huntsmen could not bring themselves to do as the queen had ordered, so they released the gentle girl by the riverbank with a warning never to return to the castle.
- |
  

- Fearing the queen's wrath, the huntsmen then killed a small deer and cut out its eyes, tongue, and heart.
- |
  

- They planned to present them to the queen as proof that they had done her bidding.
- |
  

- By the time they got back to the castle, however, the queen had already forgotten about the incident, and the princess was in the royal chambers, trying on her stepmother's jewelry.
- Mad with love, a handsome prince threw himself from a tower because his father, the king, had forbidden him to marry a certain peasant girl.
- |
  

- The fall didn't kill the prince, but the brambles he fell into scratched his eyes.
- |
  

- Now blind as well as mad, he wandered for many years throughout the land, searching for the girl his father had banished.
- |
  

- Finally he found her, living in a simple cottage nestled in a clearing in the woods.
- |
  

- Even though his eyes were white, his face wrinkled, and his beard had grown down to his knees, the peasant girl recognized the prince at once.
- |
  

- She rushed to embrace him, and wept.
- |
  

- Her tears of joy fell into his eyes and, miraculously, cleared them.
- |
  

- He could see as well as ever.
- |
  

- He was still crazy, though.
- A miller bragged to all the townspeople that his daughter could spin straw into gold.
- |
  

- The king heard tell of this, and came to take the girl's hand in marriage.
- |
  

- Upon their return to the castle, the king locked the poor girl in a room filled with straw and ordered her to spin it into gold during the night, else she would die.
- |
  

- In despair, she threw herself upon the pile of straw and began to weep.
- |
  

- Suddenly, a little man appeared in the room right in front of her.
- |
  

- Drying her tears, the girl looked up at him and asked, "Who are you?
- "\" The little man said, \""
- I'm the little man.
- "\" Perhaps the little man is here to help me spin straw into gold, the girl thought."
- |
  

- With hope in her heart, she asked, "
- Can you help me?
- "\" The little man shrugged."
- |
  

- Maybe there was a special word she needed to use.
- |
  

- The girl asked, "
- Please, can you please help me?
- "\" The little man said nothing."
- |
  

- He just stood there, looking at her, all night long.
- Once there was a woodcutter whose poor wife fell ill and died.
- |
  

- The woodcutter's new wife didn't want to look after his children, so she convinced him to take them into the forest and leave them there.
- |
  

- But the children overheard their stepmother's whisperings.
- |
  

- So when their father took them into the forest, they left a trail of breadcrumbs behind them, to mark the way home.
- |
  

- Unfortunately, it's not all that unusual for children who are abused to develop learning disabilities.
- A king had three sons, each as lazy as the next.
- |
  

- He loved them all equally, but only one could become king after his death.
- |
  

- So he called them all to his bedside and said, "Whichever one of you can prove to me that he is the laziest gets to be king when I die.
- "\" The oldest son said, \""
- Father, I am so lazy I can't bring myself to blink when the rain gets in my eyes.
- "\" The second son said, \""
- Father, I am so lazy I'd rather burn my feet than pull them away from the fire.
- "\" But the third son said, \""
- Father, I'm so lazy, I can't be bothered to think up one of these examples.
- "\" The king picked the third son, even though he was probably the only one with half a chance of making it in the real world."
