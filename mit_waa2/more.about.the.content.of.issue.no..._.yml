  There is a 23,000-word article in the new issue of McSweeney's. It was
  written by Gary Greenberg, a a private-practice psychotherapist 
  who lives in rural Connecticut.
  In 1998, Gary Greenberg began a correspondence with Ted Kaczynski, the
  murderer known as the Unabomber. He and Kaczynski exchanged dozens of
  letters, with some of Kaczynski's as long as 20 pages. In the letters,
  they discussed the insidious influence of technology, the preservation
  of wild nature, the dubious claims and conclusions of the psychiatric
  
  profession, the appetites and proclivities of the American media,
  Kaczynski's life in prison, the choices made by Kaczynski's family, and
  the lessons of Russian feudalism.
  In an incredibly provocative and wide-ranging essay, Greenberg discusses
  the evolution and dissolution of his relationship with Kaczynski, along
  the way eviscerating the media that courted and then devoured the
  Unabomber, the judicial system that did everything possible to avoid
  another O.J. sort of trial, and the psychiatrists who muted Kaczynski's
  clear but unpopular principles by labeling them as paranoid
  schizophrenia.
  The article is by turns fascinating, infuriating, brilliant,
  exasperating and frequently very funny -- Greenberg's voice is sure and
  his knives are sharp. It is not to be missed. Excerpts from it will
  begin tomorrow on this site and will run throughout next week.
