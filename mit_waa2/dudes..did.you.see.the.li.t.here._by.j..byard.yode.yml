- Man, when I came out to campus for the prospective students' weekend last spring, I knew it was going to be fucking  off the hook .
- |
  

- I mean, it's just a completely different level from high school.
- |
  

- I have my own room with my best bud Kyle, and high-speed Internet  and  cable, a cafeteria open till 11 p.m.
- |
  

- Honey Nut Cheerios I could ever eat  and  an omelet bar on weekends, and even a whole floor full of totally hot sophomore chicks just an elevator ride away.
- But the library, man, the library is  the bomb .
- I mean, you know how we spent all of high school telling each other we were totally going to start staying after football practice to spend some quality time with the books?
- |
  

- And we never did?
- |
  

- "Dude\x97now the library is, like, just across the quad from my dorm room."
- |
  

- I can totally go study every morning, on the way to Psych 101.
- |
  

- Or just before lunch.
- |
  

- Or, like, right at the end of the day.
- |
  

- Or maybe late at night, if they're open that late.
- Yeah, Kyle, I think I heard, like, till 11, maybe  11:30 p.m.
- |
  

- Man, my brain is going to be totally  pumped  by spring break.
- Oh, I took the tour back during the prospective weekend.
- |
  

- It got me totally psyched.
- |
  

- "Dude, they've got the latest computerized catalog system\x97just roll right up to a terminal, type in your search terms, and it gives you a list of titles and call numbers, plus a little map to show you where they all are."
- |
  

- Fucking Dewey decimal, man.
- |
  

- It's  tight .
- |
  

- "Or maybe I'll just wander through the stacks\x97they've got those awesome shelves on wheels, so they're all space-efficient\x97and just pick something at random."
- |
  

- It'll be totally intense.
- |
  

- Six floors of books and periodicals, all ordered as neatly as soldiers on parade.
- Like that use of simile, huh, Chris?
- |
  

- Yeah, I've done a little studying over the summer, trying to get a base for hitting the big time this semester.
- |
  

- My dad's got a couple of shelves of classics in the basement.
- |
  

- "Nothing real hard\x97a little Dickens, a little Frost."
- |
  

- Some Emily Dickinson.
- |
  

- Chick was fucking messed up, dudes.
- |
  

- But she could scan like shit.
- |
  

- "\"Because I could not stop for Death, / He kindly stopped for me."
- "\" Yeah, I think I'm going to try and really hit the ground running."
- |
  

- Start with some Shakespeare sonnets, maybe work my way up to memorizing "
- Howl" by fall break.
- |
  

- I think I could totally do it, if I really just put in the time, went to the library every day and hit the books.
- I'll come back from biology and change into my nylon-mesh shorts and this awesome Under Armour shirt I got over the summer.
- |
  

- It's sleeveless, so you can totally see my new tattoo, with the Mark Twain quote.
- |
  

- "\"The man who doesn't read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them."
- "\" Words to live by, man."
- |
  

- Because, yeah, it's about showing off a bit, too.
- |
  

- I'll sit down at a table across from the big glass windows in the second-floor lounge, so I can get a bit of reflection, check myself out.
- |
  

- Maybe catch some chicks checking me out, too.
- |
  

- "I'll be all cool and stuff\x97I'll have my headphones on, with Nickelback going, and I'll just keep turning pages."
- |
  

- But I'll know they're watching.
- |
  

- Getting totally hot for my mind.
- "I tell you what, though, dudes\x97you only get a chance like this while you're in college."
- |
  

- After we graduate, we'll have to figure out how to fit studying into our work schedules, make time to get to the city library branch and its crappy little collection.
- |
  

- Yeah, while I'm here on campus, my life is totally going to revolve around that library.
