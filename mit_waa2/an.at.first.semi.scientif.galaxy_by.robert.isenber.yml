  Too obvious, and too close. The only argument for this \"whirlpool\" galaxy is its glowing core\x97just like the one that Luke, Leia, and the droids gaze upon at the end of  Empire . Still, there are a lot of whirlpool galaxies (about 100 billion), and Andromeda, at 2.2 million light-years from Earth, is hardly that \"far, far away.\"\n\
  M102\n\
  This galaxy has a nice, bright core, being a prime example of a lenticular, or \"spindle,\" galaxy. Lenticular galaxies consist of older stars, which would make them younger \"a long time ago,\" depending on how long ago \"a long time ago\" was. M102 is a sticky candidate, though, because the galaxy was dubbed a \"probable\" lenticular galaxy, due to confusions in the Messier catalog. Scientists are still debating its classification. So, like, we'll consider it when they figure that all out.\n\
  M77\n\
  This light-ringed galaxy  looks  the part\x97exotic, brightly illuminated, with a creamy, delicious center and a stunning halo around the frontier\x97but it's also a Seyfert galaxy, which are famous for large numbers of quasars and intense radio and X-radiation emissions. Then again, though Obi-Wan never cruises past any quasars, the 3-D videographic communication devices always look kind of staticky. Radio interference, perhaps?\n\
