- My nose kept running so I asked the girl next to me if she had Kleenex.
- |
  

- She  said no, so I wiped my nose on my sleeve for the next hour.
- |
  

- The girl looked  contemptuous.
- A girl asked me my name.
- |
  

- Then, just before she got off the bus, she said  "You're gorgeous, Emma.
- |
  

- Have a nice night.
- "\"  At least, I think that is what  she said, but I am slightly deaf so it could have been something quite  different."
- |
  

- Then the bus got caught in traffic so she was standing in front  of me for the next twenty minutes, and I did not know what to do.
- I emailed my friend a quotation from "The Education of Henry Adams" reading  "Henry James had not yet taught the world to read a volume for the pleasure  of seeing the lights of his burning-glass turned on alternate sides of the  same figure.
- "\"  Two days later he told me that he had sent me that quote in  December."
- A homeless man sat next to me and seemed to have no conception at all of  personal space.
- I was reminded of the poem about the Adams family by Stephen Vincent Benet  and Rosemary Benet.
- One day the bus was so full that I could not sit down.
- |
  

- Instead of reading I  started a loud conversation with the two fellow passengers closest to  me.
- |
  

- One of them was a tourist, but the other one rides that bus  regularly, and ever since I keep running into her and we have to make  strained conversation.
- The Lakers were in the NBA finals and all the buses kept flashing Go Lakers!
- |
  

- But one bus I was on kept flashing Go  Raiders!
- |
  

- I had dinner with my mother at a Japanese restaurant.
- |
  

- As we finished our  dinner I told my mother that I was reading "The Education of Henry Adams.
- "\"   She began to tell me about a book that was a biography of the father of  Henry and his brother James."
- |
  

- I said "
- Charles Francis Adams?
- "\"  Just then the  waiter began to clear away our food."
- |
  

- My mother suddenly exclaimed "
- No!" and  the waiter began to apologize profusely and put our food back.
- |
  

- Then my  mother had to explain to him that she was talking to me and to me that she  was thinking of a biography of the father of Henry and William James.
- A stranger on the bus asked me how my day had been.
- |
  

- Ten minutes later he  asked me the same question.
- |
  

- Then he tried to get off the bus, but the bus  did not stop where he wanted it to, so he began to swear at the bus driver.
- Drifting in the dead-water of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle&nbsp;&#151; and during this last  decade everyone talked, and seemed to feel, fin-de-si&egrave;cle&nbsp;&#151; where not a  breath stirred the idle air of education or fretted the mental torpor of  self-content, I lived alone.
- If you are wondering why this is a social solecism, let me remind you that  it is no longer the fin-de-si&egrave;cle, and to carry over into the new century  the habits of the old is iredeemably gauche.
