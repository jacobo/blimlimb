- Your average 12-year-old boy is about 5 feet tall, weighs in the area of a buck-fifteen, and has developed little muscle mass.
- I am 21, approximately 6 feet tall, tip the scales at an even 180, and have a moderately athletic and muscular build.
- Judging on these statistics and what I assume would be a natural ferocity that would spring forth in a moment of physical danger, I estimate that I could beat up seven 12-year-olds before they overtook me.

- Of course, these would have to be the aforementioned average-sized 12-year-olds.

- Future linebackers, NBA players, and all Scandinavian children would throw off this equation.

- On the flip side, if these were some wimpy, four-square-playing, future-jockey 12-year-olds, I imagine the number would skyrocket to anywhere between 12 and 15.

- It's simple exponential math.
- This is also assuming that my opponents are smart enough to organize themselves into a circular attack instead of coming at me one by one.
- |
  

- If it were an individual, king-of-the-mountain battle royale, I could endlessly pummel 12-year-olds without mercy.
- |
  

- But we're assuming at least a sixth-grade education in a marginal public school as well as some exposure to kung-fu movies, so these kids would form a circle.
- However, using my quick wits, I would charge one portion of the circle, landing a devastating blow on the unlucky individual, which would make the others proceed with hesitancy.
- |
  

- One on one, I feel like I could deliver a lot of punishment to a 12-year-old.
- |
  

- There would be one or two brave ones who would jump on my back, distracting me and thus enabling the others to attack.
- |
  

- At best, I could fight off the two heroes on my back and maybe take out four on the ground before I was felled by fatigue and numerous kicks to my groin and shins.
- |
  

- This would equal a grand total of seven.
- My friend Brian, who stands about 6 feet 2 inches and is stronger than myself, estimates that he could take down a dozen 12-year-olds.
- |
  

- I find this hard to believe, but he has been in a fight with people his own age and is a little taller, making groin shots more difficult.
- |
  

- Brian's reach is much longer than mine as well, which is a huge advantage.
- |
  

- If you can land solid shots from a distance longer than the 12-year-olds' legs, there is no need to worry about groin kicks.
- He says he would attack one portion of the circle in a fury, scaring off any would-be heroes who wanted to jump on his back and sacrifice themselves for the group.
- |
  

- Then he would deal massive blows until fatigue and the inevitable groin shots brought him to the ground.
- |
  

- I told him I'd give him nine or ten, but even for the above-average Brian, taking down a dozen 12-year-olds seems like a lot.
- If it weren't for the law and my own morals, we could put these pressing questions to rest.
- |
  

- Alas, these barriers still stand in our way.
- I'm a pacifist anyway.
