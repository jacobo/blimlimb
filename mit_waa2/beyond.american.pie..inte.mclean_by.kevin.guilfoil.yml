  VINCENT (STARRY STARRY NIGHT)
  Starry Starry night
  McLean opens this history of Packers football (and tribute to the great Vince Lombardi) by invoking a name that represents the golden era of the Green Bay franchise: Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr (Note that while most Packers games were played on Sunday afternoon, the contests would often stretch into evening, particularly if there had been a lot of passing).
  Paint your palette blue and gray 
  Look out on a summer's day 
  With eyes that know the darkness in my soul 
  Shadows on the hills 
  Sketch the trees and daffodils 
  Catch the breeze and the winter chills 
  On colors in the snowy linen land
  The rest of the verse refers to the Ice Bowl, played between Green Bay and the "Blue and Gray" Dallas Cowboys on December 31, 1967. Many consider it to be the greatest football game in NFL history. The "darkness in my soul" is surely McLean's despair following Dan Reeves's touchdown strike to Lance Rentzel, which put Dallas up by three at the start of the fourth quarter. Ultimately, Starr would win the game (and the NFL Championship) on a quarterback sneak from the one-yard line with 13 seconds remaining.
  The "trees and daffodils" are an impressionistic portrait of the Packers' classic green and yellow uniforms, but the mention of "summer" has long baffled McLean scholars, who observe that the wind chill on New Year's Eve was minus 46 degrees. It could be a clue that this narrative is a reminiscence, penned in summer, or he could have meant the line to be ironic. In any event, the lack of consensus on this point should be recognized.
  Now I understand 
  What you tried to say to me 
  How you suffered for your sanity 
  How you tried to set them free 
  They would not listen, they did not know how 
  Perhaps they'll listen now
  Here, songwriter Don McLean cleverly substitutes his first-person persona for Green Bay head coach Ray "Scooter" McLean, Lombardi's immediate predecessor, who resigned in disgrace after leading the Pack to a franchise-worst 1-10-1 record. The song turns prescient in this chorus as the post-Lombardi Packers refuse to "listen" to the coach's insistence that "Winning isn't everything. It's the only thing." In fact, Green Bay never once made the playoffs between 1972 and 1982.
  Starry Starry night 
  Flaming flowers that brightly blaze 
  Swirling clouds in violet haze 
  Reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue
  There are two schools of thought regarding this verse, known widely  as the "Trash Talk Stanza." The traditional interpretation holds that "flaming flowers that brightly blaze" is McLean's challenge to the manhood of NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle (see Paul Hornung below). Others claim the insertion of "violet haze" in the next line directs the barb toward Fran Tarkenton, the girlish quarterback of Green Bay's rival Minnesota Vikings. A closer listening, however, reveals that the second of these is most likely a misheard or erroneously-transcribed lyric. What McLean is actually singing here is "violent haze," referring to Lombardi's special love for the physicality of the game. "Dancing is a contact sport," Lombardi once said. "Football is a collision sport."
  Colors changing hue 
  Morning fields of amber grain 
  Weathered faces lined in pain 
  Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
  "Morning fields of amber grain" may also be read as a pun&nbsp;&#151; "mourning fields of amber grain"&nbsp;&#151; and reflects McLean's sadness in 1963 at the sudden departure of the Golden Boy, Paul Hornung, who was suspended by Rozelle for one season in the wake of a gambling scandal. More patent is the line, "Weathered faces lined in pain," a touching salute to defensive stalwarts like linebacker Ray Nitschke, who toiled and prospered under "the artist" Lombardi's "loving hand."

  Starry Starry night 
  Portraits hung in empty halls 
  Frameless heads on nameless walls 
  With eyes that watch the world and can't forget 
  Like the strangers that you've met 
  The ragged men in ragged clothes 
  The silver thorn of bloody rose 
  Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 
  Now I think I know 
  What you tried to say to me 
  How you suffered for your sanity 
  How you tried to set them free 
  They did not listen, they're not listening still
