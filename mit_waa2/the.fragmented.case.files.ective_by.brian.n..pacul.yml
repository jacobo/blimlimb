- "\"Showalter, do you really expect this sting operation of yours to work?"
- "\" said Chief of Police Darren Smallerby."
- |
  

- "\"What if Rodriguez doesn't take the bait?"
- "\"Don't worry, Smallerby,\""
- |
  

- Brock.
- |
  

- "\"Christ Jesus may be the only way into the Kingdom of Heaven, but there's more than one way to catch a dope peddler."
- Smallerby frowned.
- |
  

- "\"That's all wrong!"
- "\" shouted Officer Bixby."
- |
  

- "\"You're full of it, Brock!"
- "\"You bet I am,\""
- |
  

- Brock.
- |
  

- "\"Full of the Holy Spirit, that is."
- |
  

- "\"You can't keep beating yourself up over Frank Parmonte's death, Brock."
- |
  

- It wasn't your fault,"
- |
  

- Officer Danwick.
- |
  

- "\"There's no way you could have stopped it from happening."
- |
  

- Just remember, he's in Heaven now, watching over Frank Junior.
- "\"Actually,\""
- |
  

- Brock, "he's in Hell now.
- |
  

- Frank was Catholic.
- |
  

- Officer Lamke covered his eyes and gagged.
- |
  

- "\"This is the most gruesome crime scene I've ever seen!"
- "\" he exclaimed."
- Brock turned away.
- |
  

- "\"There's only one hoodlum who could be capable of such a monstrous atrocity."
- "\"Who?"
- "\" asked Lamke."
- |
  

- "\"Rodriguez?"
- "\"Satan,\""
- |
  

- Brock.
- |
  

- "\"It seems our unlikely partnership has come to an end,\""
- |
  

- Bruno Levi, Orthodox Jewish Bounty Hunter.
- |
  

- "\"And to think, we almost had Rodriguez this time."
- Brock smiled.
- |
  

- "\"Until we meet again, Christ-killer."
- They both laughed.
- |
  

- "\"Well, that one's in the bag,\""
- |
  

- Chief Smallerby.
- |
  

- "\"Nice work, Showalter."
- |
  

- Case closed.
- "\"That's what you think, Chief,\""
- |
  

- Brock.
- |
  

- "\"But if you ask me, there are more holes in that case than the Theory of Evolution."
- Smallerby dropped his coffee mug.
- |
  

- "\"If you could go back in time and be anybody you want to be,\""
- |
  

- Officer Lamke, "what would you choose?
- "\"I'd be a king in medieval times,\""
- |
  

- Sergeant Crawdad.
- "\"I'd want to go back to World War II, and be an ace fighter pilot,\""
- |
  

- Lieutenant Ballywick.
- "\"I'd like to be a citizen of Rome in the first century,\""
- |
  

- Brock, "and be savagely martyred for my faith in Christ.
- |
  

- "\"We're out of bullets,\""
- |
  

- Jimmy.
- |
  

- "\"Gasoline is leaking all over the floor, our car is gone, and twelve of Rodriguez's men are outside that door."
- |
  

- This is it, boss!
- |
  

- This is the end!
- |
  

- We're done for!
- Brock chuckled quietly.
- |
  

- "\"With God, all things are possible, Jimmy."
- |
  

- The foundation of the building shook.
- "\"Brock!"
- "\" cried nightclub singer Mia Wellborn, \""
- |
  

- "\"It could be a bomb,\""
- |
  

- Brock, "unless it's the Rapture, in which case you're on your own, sister.
- |
  

- "\"Now, do you see?"
- "\" asked Professor Gurmley."
- |
  

- "\"Mankind did not evolve from apes or monkeys."
- |
  

- We all had the same common ancestor.
- |
  

- Somewhere down the line, one branch of that ancestor's family tree evolved into monkeys, another branch evolved into apes, and yet another evolved into human beings.
- Brock narrowed his eyes.
- |
  

- "\"Do you expect me to swallow this nonsense about my forefathers being chimpanzees?"
- |
  

- "\"Follow me!"
- "\" shouted Brock."
- |
  

- "\"They ran in here!"
- "\"Brock, are you sure?"
- "\" gasped Officer Luftrack."
- "\"Is the Pope the Anti-Christ?"
- They dashed inside.
- |
  

- "\"At last, we meet again,\""
- |
  

- Rodriguez gloated.
- |
  

- "\"But this time, the advantage is mine."
- |
  

- Any last words before you meet your maker, Mr. Showalter?
- "\"Jesus is Lord,\""
- |
  

- Brock, "and whosoever believeth in Him shall have life everlasting.
- Rodriguez pulled the trigger.
- |
  

- "\"So it ends,\""
- |
  

- Rodriguez.
- |
  

- "\"Isn't this what you always wanted, Showalter?"
- |
  

- Leave me to die in peace.
- "\"No,\""
- |
  

- Brock, kneeling before his bullet-riddled criminal mastermind archnemesis.
- |
  

- "\"Not until I tell you the Good News about Jesus."
