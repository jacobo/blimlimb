- Lila was a terrible student.

- She looked at the teacher with a face of dubious confusion.

- Though she knew nothing and learned nothing, she was willing and handed in her essays on time.

- Her teacher was one of seventeen she had ever had.

- His name was Mr. Phelps.

- He lived alone and his wife came to visit him with pies of every nature three times a week.

- "\"Loving the song of the bird doesn't give you a more beautiful voice."

- You are locked in.

- All humans are locked in.

- Each human is a species unto itself.
- |
  

- Comparing yourself with anyone &#151; even if she is your age and has curlier, blonder hair &#151; is like pitting pigs against toads.

- You would not pit a pig against a toad, right?
- She showed that she agreed with him on this fine point but did not change her expression, so he was not convinced.
- He asked her patiently, "In what situation would you pit a pig against a toad?
- She hated learning.

- Her mother was a terrible woman and permitted Lila to sit with feet on the table.
- |
  

- She let the girl beat her in sports because she just didn't care.
- |
  

- Lila never got any better this way, and one of her mother's suitors thought, upon meeting Lila, that she had been born retarded.
- |
  

- But she was not retarded; she just hadn't been given the proper care.
- |
  

- Of course, she did not accept the proper care.
- |
  

- Like all things, she determined the rules of her own existence.
- |
  

- Her mother couldn't prevent Lila from being the way she was.
- |
  

- But that didn't stop those who knew the situation from criticising her anyway, fundamentally, for letting such a life exist.
- |
  

- Lila ordered a bouquet of roses and sat with them at her vanity table and looked at them as though, as her teacher had suggested, they were an alien species.
- |
  

- She wouldn't compare them to a bucket of water.
- |
  

- She wouldn't compare them to a snail.
- |
  

- She liked snails; they had shells they could curl themselves into.
- |
  

- Roses had no shells.
- |
  

- But roses were romantic.
- On her speed-dial princess phone she called up a boy she had met once, several years ago.
- |
  

- He had heard from her monthly, sometimes weekly, since they had danced together that one time.
- |
  

- Already he was somewhere on his way to becoming a lawyer, if he wasn't a lawyer already.
- |
  

- His girlfriend was very sleek and not at all lumpy; a girlfriend to be proud of.
- |
  

- She had slick brown hair, not at all the sort of hair that one found on imported dolls.
- He was exasperated when he found out it was Lila.
- "\"You sent me roses,\""
- |
  

- "\"Can't you tell I can't stand you!"
- |
  

- "\" he cried, in a voice he used with nobody except her."
- |
  

- She deserved it.
- |
  

- She looked into the receiver and one contained bit of her sobbed uncontrollably at the tone he used, but the rest of her was blank with dumb confusion.
- |
  

- She didn't know what to make of it.
- |
  

- Who was he again?
- |
  

- She put the receiver to her ear and heard a click and then silence.
- |
  

- Her tongue lolled out slightly between her teeth as she hung up the phone.
- |
  

- She would not pit a cow against a bouquet of roses.
- |
  

- Whatever for?
- |
  

- The cow would win, surely.

  "By looking at a rose you do not turn a little more red," he gave as one example. "Loving the song of the bird doesn't give you a more beautiful voice. You are locked in. All humans are locked in.
