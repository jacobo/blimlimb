- Some time ago, Peter McGrath and Jenny Traig, cousins, left their jobs to become self-declared shut-ins.
- |
  

- They quickly discovered that even the shut-in's life is full of many small mysteries.
- |
  

- Inspired by the great tradition of housebound detectives, they resolved to become investigators themselves.
- |
  

- More recently, they decided to fill the gaping hole of  loneliness in their lives with the detective's classic companion, a cat.
- |
  

- In no time at all they learned that these creatures can be sources of great mystery themselves.
- |
  

- The following are cases from their feline files.
- |
  

- The Case of the Anthropomorphic Drink Hog
- "Status: Solved"
- Although Peter and Jenny left the work force long ago, they have retained some of its customs.
- |
  

- Their favorite is the coffee break, and after a trying morning of shooing away Sierra Club canvassers and crank-calling relatives, they will sometimes indulge in a cup or two.
- |
  

- Most days, the cat joins them.
- "\"I guess that cup is yours now, kitty,\""
- |
  

- Jenny grumbled one recent afternoon as he lapped at her mug.
- |
  

- "\"Why,\""
- |
  

- "\"when he has three dishes of his own\x97not counting what he views as 'the big, flushing dish' in the bathroom\x97does he insist on drinking out of ours?"
- The sleuths had another mystery on their hands.
- |
  

- "\"Perhaps it's because he's a caffeine junkie,\""
- |
  

- Peter suggested.
- Jenny countered that he seemed to prefer decaffeinated drinks and liked water best of all.
- "\"Well, then, maybe it's because our water tastes better."
- A regrettable taste test of the cat's water dish disproved that theory.
- Two cups of coffee later, Jenny had arrived at the solution.
- |
  

- "\"He drinks out of cups because he thinks he's people."
- |
  

- That's it.
- |
  

- That's totally it.
- |
  

- That's it that's it that's it.
- |
  

- My hands are shaking.
- |
  

- He's people.
- Peter nodded.
- |
  

- "\"He thinks he's one person in particular: our jerky friend K\x97, who drinks out of other people's cups, too."
- |
  

- What a jerk.
- The mystery was solved.
- |
  

- "All that remained was to cure the cat of his bad habit, a goal achieved in short order, the same way it had been done with K\x97: by adding a plug of shower hair and a floater of liquid smoke to a murky chai he had no business drinking from in the first place."
- |
  

- The Case of the Offensive Odor; or, You Can't Feed That to a Kitty
- "Status: Solved"
- Like many young people, Peter and Jenny enjoy mind games.
- |
  

- Recently, they were enjoying a round of "What Were You Thinking?
- "\" when their fun was interrupted by a terrible smell."
- |
  

- The cousins pretended not to notice it, each fearing that the other was the scent's author, but, finally, they could stand it no more.
- |
  

- After trading accusations and some words they both wish they could take back, it became clear that the cat was actually responsible.
- |
  

- "One mystery remained: what, exactly, had the feline eaten?"
- The Shut-Ins rifled through the pantry looking for suspect foodstuffs.
- |
  

- "\"It couldn't be the pasta, because the kitty doesn't know how to use the stove,\""
- |
  

- Jenny reasoned.
- "\"Not shortbread, because that's easy on the stomach,\""
- |
  

- Peter added.
- It wasn't the canned mushrooms, the apple jelly, or the artichoke hearts.
- |
  

- What, then, was the culprit?
- "\"You know what it might have been?"
- "\" Jenny suddenly interjected."
- |
  

- "\"This morning, when I couldn't find his food, I fed him some old corn chowder instead."
- |
  

- Because it was chunky and smelled fishy, like everything else he eats.
- The feline deposited confirming clues in his box the next day.
- |
  

- The corn chowder, and Jenny's poor judgment, were, in fact, to blame.
- |
  

- "\"What were you thinking, indeed,\""
- |
  

- Peter said.
- |
  

- The evidence was overpowering, but the Shut-Ins agreed to pretend they didn't notice it until their roommate Angela returned home from work and cleaned the box out herself.
