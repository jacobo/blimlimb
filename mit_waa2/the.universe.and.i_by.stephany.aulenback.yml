- Learn to say YES to the universe and the universe will say YES to you.

- I, for example, say YES to the universe and the universe says YES to me.
- I see myself in the universe's mirrored sunglasses.
- I have tongue-kissed the universe.

- The universe has really soft lips.

- The universe also has great minty breath.
- The universe likes to stroke my back and braid my hair.

- The universe gives me pedicures.
- I have taken the universe as my lover.

- In other words, you might say the universe has become my lover.
- Learn to say YES to the universe and the universe will say YES to you!
- Sometimes the universe and I play dominoes.

- On Sundays, in the late afternoon, when the sunlight just barely comes slanting through the blinds, I sit on the universe's lap, and the universe lets me beat his ass every time.
- I like to rub my cheeks against the universe's stubble.

- The universe has really great eyes.

- Never mind his soft lips and his minty breath.
- The universe just gave me his high school jacket.

- The universe just bought me a silver Camaro.

- The universe says he'll give me a promise ring as soon as he saves up some more money from his part-time job working at the Foot Locker.
- You may not know this, but the universe is ticklish.

- You have to know just the right spot.
- Don't you want a little action?

- I ride the universe like a wild, wild horse.
- Looks like I am having the universe's baby.
- I say YES to the universe and he says HOW HIGH to me!
- "I'm telling you: learn to say YES to the universe, and the universe will say YES to you, too."
