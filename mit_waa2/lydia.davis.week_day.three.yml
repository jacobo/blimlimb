- Hello everyone.
- |
  

- "We have good news: Lydia Davis's new collection, Samuel Johnson Is Indignant, is now available."
- |
  

- Copies can be had online, though  us , or on Amazon, and at most bookstores.
- This week, we'll be featuring testimonials from writers and  readers  about Lydia's work, along with excerpts from the new book, and reviews past and present.
- |
  

- "There are also these new links, with more to come:      A brief  biography  of Lydia Davis    Early praise  for Samuel Johnson Is Indignant    A small roundup of  past praise  for Lydia Davis   Lydia's  homepage  at PreviewPort   An  interview  with Lydia on Salon   A nice  article  about Lydia winning the Insigna of the Order of Arts and Letters from the French government for her translation work    Tour dates  for Lydia"
- We will add to these links as the week goes on.
- |
  

- Many months ago, when we first knew we'd get the chance to publish Lydia Davis's new book, we held a reading at Housing Works in New York City, where Jonathan Lethem and Zadie Smith read new work, They Might Be Giants played, and Lydia read from Samuel Johnson Is Indignant.
- Few of the audience members had heard her read before&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;her readings are rare.
- |
  

- And though much of the crowd wasn't previously familiar with the pieces she read, and many weren't familiar with her work at all, everyone was spellbound.
- |
  

- Her presence was commanding but she was also very warm, very funny, once or twice laughing a little at her own work.
- |
  

- She even read "Oral History with Hiccups," a story that on the printed page requires vast experimentation with the space bar, and read aloud required Lydia to actually fake a series of hiccups in the middle of various words. It was amazing.
- In the audience that night was David Byrne, who was enchanted and with whom Lydia recently read at a benefit we held downtown.
- |
  

- They make a strange and fitting pair, and now their work will be in at least one way forever entwined.
- |
  

- In a weird twist, a photo that Byrne had taken and was included in The New Sins became the cover of Samuel Johnson Is Indignant.
- |
  

- While we were laying out the book and trying out possible covers, Byrne's image was used as a backdrop for the type, more as a placeholder than as any kind of definite idea.
- |
  

- But it somehow worked, and Lydia really liked the image of the Virgin Mary juxtaposed with the seemingly unrelated title&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and we did, too.
- |
  

- Note that the covers of the book that were on hand at that last event were advance copies, had a few defects, and have been significantly altered.
- |
  

- If you bought a book that night, it's one of about 300 with that particular cover.
- |
  

- The point is that you should hear Lydia Davis read.
- |
  

- As a primer, you can hear her read stories from Samuel Johnson Is Indignant, including "The Old Dictionary" and "New Year's Resolution," here in RealAudio, on the  Conjunctions website .
- Just as a reminder, here are Lydia's  East Coast tour dates .
- |
  

- She does not tour often, at all, so don't miss this chance.
- And we should have mentioned sooner that in concert with our publication of Samuel Johnson Is Indignant, Farrar Straus & Giroux is reissuing Lydia's books, Almost No Memory, Break It Down, and The End of the Story.
- |
  

- They're available at  these independent bookstores , among other locations.
- |
  

- Now continuing the testimonials, today we have Heidi Julavits, author of The Mineral Palace, and our own Ben Greenman, author of Superbad, which will be out in less than a month.
- |
  

- You can also read previous testimonials by  Rick Moody  and  Christopher Kennedy .

- "This is what it feels like to encounter Lydia Davis's writing: you're on a bus, a city bus, and you find yourself being recruited (because you're polite and sympathetic) to listen to the earnest and quietly plodding discussion your seatmate is having with himself."
- |
  

- Your seatmate, for whom you are providing this tremendously charitable service, is a bland, unremarkable fellow, possibly his fingernails are a bit grotty and his suit shiny and old, but otherwise he's just a person riding a bus, delivering a measured treatise on the unethical treatment of reindeer in Wisconsin.
- |
  

- Quite possibly your mild-mannered seatmate is missing a few salad forks from his silverware drawer, but even so you feel compelled to hear him out,  you even indulge in the occasional patronizing nod and say, indeed, it's really savage what they're doing to those reindeer up there.
- |
  

- Then, because you're bored, you start to listen a bit more closely and as you do so, his sentences begin to warp into the lines from a naively zany and wondrous logic proof.
- |
  

- You understand, now that you're actually paying attention, that your seatmate isn't really talking about the unethical treatment of reindeer in Wisconsin, but about loneliness, and obsession, and lovesickness, among other things.
- |
  

- The more you listen the more apparent it becomes that this man without the right number of salad forks is actually quite a bit more brilliant and insightful than you are&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;in fact, you realize, by the time you've reached your stop, that you're the one without the salad forks, that this guy has all the salad forks, and you're just some fool person riding a bus.

- IV.
- Some years ago, as a book reviewer for TimeOut New York, I drew&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;or perhaps requested&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the assignment of an interview with Lydia on the occasion of the publication of Almost No Memory, a collection of pieces that, despite their brevity and indirectness, still managed to suggest both the vitality and the precariousness of the human condition.
- The shortest piece, if I recall correctly, was only fifty-seven words, which is the length of the first sentence of this paragraph.
- |
  

- Perhaps it was even shorter.
- |
  

- Lydia was appearing at the National Arts Club in Chelsea, and we agreed to meet at Friend of a Farmer, a restaurant near the club.
- While I waited for her, I watched a couple at a table downstairs.
- |
  

- "They were fighting over some sticking point in their relationship: someone had wronged someone else, and that someone else had decided that being wronged in this manner was intolerable."
- |
  

- "They spoke like this: \"dissolving the bonds."
- |
  

- "\" They didn't seem angry."
- |
  

- They seemed sad and slightly disoriented.
- |
  

- At one point, the man wondered aloud whether it would be prudent to give things another try.
- |
  

- The woman said she would consider it; then she got up to go to the bathroom.
- That's when Lydia appeared; I knew her from the picture on her book jacket.
- |
  

- "\"Lydia?"
- "\" I said."
- |
  

- For some reason it seemed more polite than "
- Ms. Davis.
- "\" \""
- Yes," she said.
- |
  

- "\"Hi,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- We sat upstairs, in a small room just to the north of the main upstairs dining room, and we discussed a series of topics in a leisurely manner, never raising our voices in argument, never lowering them in conspiracy.
- |
  

- I took notes only occasionally, when Lydia said something that I knew I would use as a quote in my piece.
- |
  

- We talked about genre, of course, about what characteristics define a piece of writing as fiction, or literature, or a story, or an essay, or a pens&eacute;e, or a memoir.
- |
  

- We talked about memory, about how no human experience ever committed to prose has the status of a pure record.
- We talked about Proust, of course, and probably Borges, and probably Barthes, and maybe Stendahl.
- |
  

- "The interview was excellent: she was careful with her answers, sometimes funny, always sincere, and she had a habit of posing questions to me in response to my questions, which was not annoying but rather gratifying, inasmuch as it acknowledged that while the situation had created an artificial distinction between the roles of interviewer and interviewee, we were both writers seeking answers to problems that had bedeviled other writers for millennia."
- When we finished up, and I went downstairs, the couple whose romantic fate had been hanging in the balance was still sitting there&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;or rather, the man was still sitting there, as if he'd been waiting for the woman to return from the bathroom for hours.
- |
  

- I don't know what happened to them.
- |
  

- I do know, more or less, what happened to Lydia.
- |
  

- "She continued to write, and to translate Proust, and to try to pick the locks of the problems of narrative and memory: to try to ascertain when a recollection of a series of events crosses the line from mere description to something greater."
