- On Vinyl Liners
- "I don't have anything against pools that have vinyl liners, except for one thing: they suck."
- |
  

- Even Shamu doesn't swim in a vinyl-lined pool.
- |
  

- The only time I've ever used a vinyl liner was when I built my wife a turtle pond.
- |
  

- And it leaked.
- |
  

- One day I found the turtles scraping along the bottom, freaked out of their minds.
- |
  

- Imagine coming home and finding your kids in a similar predicament.
- |
  

- Not pretty.
- On Trust
- Here's what you need to know about Decker Moody.
- |
  

- He's honest.
- |
  

- Not because he's telling you he's honest, but because he is, after all, me, and lying in the third person would be idiotic and pointless, even if I were telling you the truth, which I am.
- On Aesthetics
- "Grottoes, negative edges, spill-over spas, a cascading sun shelf, waterfalls, fiber-optic lighting, beach entries, misting systems, in-water bars, caves, rock slides, wave generation\x97we do it all, often for a single pool."
- |
  

- It's about integrating your ideas with the terrain of your property to create a more attractive backyard.
- |
  

- Or front yard.
- |
  

- Because I'm a freak like that.
- On Reputation
- Anybody can win some artsy-fartsy award.
- |
  

- But how many contractors have a former centerfold in their promotional literature?
- |
  

- I feel that having my work showcased in blockbuster films is the most satisfying honor.
- |
  

- Lusty Latins 18  and  A Tale of Two Titties  have detailed footage of a new style of coping I invented called Coral Reef, which is embedded with protruding shards of oyster shell.
- |
  

- Patent  that , pool-guild beeotches.
- On Guarantees
- I've carved pools out of mountainsides, dug into the roofs of skyscrapers, and plumbed Gulfstreams to accommodate high-altitude cannonballs.
- |
  

- I like to take risks.
- |
  

- I could die tomorrow; so could you.
- |
  

- Owning a pool is about living life to its fullest, about existing in the moment.
- |
  

- Coming home after a hard day and letting thoughts of mortgage payments, flat tires, and that irascible co-worker who you're certain stole your iPod just float away.
- |
  

- Gone is stress and tension.
- |
  

- Replaced with serenity, lowered blood pressure, and increased energy.
- |
  

- You can't have a nervous breakdown while sitting in a spa.
- |
  

- Pools often widen one's social circle, and I've seen them bring families together, even mend broken marriages.
- |
  

- A pool can replenish the marrow of your soul.
- |
  

- Then again, lots of people drown.
- |
  

- Decker Moody is not God.
- On the Customer
- Like I said, I don't focus on winning awards.
- |
  

- A cheap plaque didn't buy my wife's Rover, or the Presidential on my wrist.
- |
  

- Customers enable me to buy those things, as well as private planes, vacation homes, and, every now and then, influence with building-code officials.
- |
  

- Customers deserve all the accolades as far as I'm concerned, which is why I throw an annual party in their honor on my yacht.
- |
  

- Hope to see you this fall in Sardinia!
