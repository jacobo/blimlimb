  Look closely at some of today's hit movies. How could these
  multimillionaire Hollywood bigshots be so careless? A few examples:

  "The Story of Us"
  In the suburban household where Katie and Ben Jordan (Michelle
  Pfeiffer, Bruce
     Willis) live with their two teenage children, a delivery man emerges
  in a key
     scene wearing a black leather jacket with a gold zipper on the
  right-breast
     pocket. In the very next scene, however, the delivery man is still
  wearing a
     black leather jacket with a gold zipper on the right-breast pocket,
  but Mr.
     Willis's wig looks stupid.

  "Bowfinger"
  When Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy)--searching for his girlfriend in a
  Hollywood
     restaurant--picks up a pack of matches and sticks it into his
  briefcase, it is
     evident that a broken chair lies next to the jukebox. Look closely,
  however,
     after the camera returns to the jukebox after panning away for a
  moment. The
     broken chair still remains next to the jukebox, but Eddie Murphy is
  an asshole.
