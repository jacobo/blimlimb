- This Saturday, April 22, Earth Day turns thirty.
- |
  

- We recently caught up  with Earth Day for a pre-birthday interview.
- "Interviewer: Happy Birthday."
- "Earth Day: Yeah, yeah."
- |
  

- Thanks.
- "Interviewer: You don't sound too excited."
- "Earth Day: No, no."
- |
  

- It's good.
- |
  

- A little weird, I guess.
- |
  

- I mean,  thirty.
- |
  

- Fuck, right?
- "Interviewer: Well, you must at least be pleased with this year's  celebration -- 4,500 organizations planning events in 180 countries."
- "Earth Day: Yeah, yeah."
- |
  

- Should be good.
- "Interviewer: Have you decided where you'll be?"
- "Earth Day: No, not yet."
- |
  

- I don't know, I'm actually thinking about just sitting this one out, maybe getting some dinner with a few friends, something simple.
- |
  

- I mean, what am I gonna do?
- |
  

- Go out  and do a bunch of shots or something?
- "Interviewer: Is."
- |
  

- Earth Day?
- "Earth Day: No. Course not."
- |
  

- It's a serious day.
- |
  

- Christ, usually I'm out  there trying to get people inspired to save the Earth and what have you.
- |
  

- Pause] When I was younger, sure, I'd go out, maybe get a little wild.
- |
  

- But, hell,  now I'm such a lightweight.
- |
  

- Three drinks and I'm a puddle.
- |
  

- Sorta sad if you think about it.
- "Interviewer: Sad that you get drunk after only three drinks?"
- "Earth Day: Okay, okay."
- |
  

- I'm not saying it's as sad as global warming or plastic.
- |
  

- But, well.
- |
  

- I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm  saying.
- |
  

- Really.
- |
  

- It's just.
- |
  

- Thirty.
- |
  

- The big three-oh.
- |
  

- Thirty.
- |
  

- Man, you know  it's one thing to be 27, you're 27, you're out there.
- |
  

- You're a kid.
- |
  

- People think you're a kid, some kind of wunderkind.
- |
  

- But they respect you.
- |
  

- You're this day,  this increasingly big day.
- |
  

- You're not, you know, Memorial Day or anything,  but you've got concerts in Central Park, and phone calls from the President, and  Leo calls and says he's having this thing, and him and Tobey Maguire and Blaine  and, Christ, I think it was Penelope Cruz or somebody, they're all there  with him, and they're like screaming into the phone that I have to come.
- |
  

- I mean,  I know it sounds silly, and this was a few years ago.
- |
  

- Pause] I'm sorry.
- |
  

- I  don't even know where I'm going here.
- |
  

- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- Really.
- |
  

- What did you want to  know?
- |
  

- What was the question?
- "Interviewer: Well, just that."
- |
  

- "Earth Day: Look, it's not even that."
- |
  

- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- Excuse me, but I think  I remember where I was going.
- |
  

- Would it be okay, if I just finished where  I was going?
- "Interviewer: By all means."
- |
  

- "Earth Day: Great."
- |
  

- It's just that, you know, fine, thirty, whatever.
- |
  

- So clich&eacute;, yeah, I know.
- |
  

- Blah, blah, blah.
- |
  

- But I'll tell you, it makes you think,  it really does.
- |
  

- Where am I? What have I done?
- |
  

- Where am I  going ?
- |
  

- Take me, for instance.
- |
  

- Is the Earth really that much better off.
- |
  

- Yes, a little, some things, maybe.
- |
  

- Do I deserve some credit?
- |
  

- You know, fine, yes, I guess, a little.
- |
  

- But I have  to tell you, I wake up in the morning and I take a look around and I'm still in  this basically lousy one-bedroom apartment, you know, I've got the decent  couch, the fucking Ikea coffee table, one not-half-bad print on the wall, poorly-framed; a thing of mayo, some two-day old sushi, and a misbegotten bottle of  Veuve Cliquot from I can't remember when in the fridge.
- |
  

- Pause] And I'm alone.
- |
  

- Yeah,  okay, there it is.
- |
  

- I know, I know, get out the world's smallest violin, put  me on daytime TV, fine.
- |
  

- Hah, hah, hah.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- But, you know there it is.
- |
  

- There it really is.
- "Interviewer: So it's true that you're not seeing Arbor Day anymore?"
- "Earth Day: You know, people say, they say, \"Look at what my parents did  by the time they were thirty."
- "\" Or, \""
- Look at like what, uh, Thomas Edison, or  Vasco de Gama, what those guys did by the time they were thirty.
- "\" Not that that really applies to me since I'm a holiday, or commemorative day, or whatever  and don't have actual \""
- |
  

- "\" but, well."
- |
  

- I mean, it's like I read the other  day about these two, I think they were Burmese, twelve-year-old twins, Johnny and Luther something or other, apparently they command like an entire rebel army  in a jungle down there.
- |
  

- It was on the front page of The Times.
- |
  

- I mean, shit,  you know, fine, but they're fucking twelve, you know?
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- I don't  know.
- "Interviewer: So you're unhappy."
- "Earth Day: That's the thing."
- |
  

- I'm not.
- |
  

- Things are good.
- |
  

- What do I have  to complain about, right?
- |
  

- Pause] Maybe I'd like it if I were doing  something a little more, I don't know, a little more.
- |
  

- Whatever.
- |
  

- Look,  Earth Day is creative.
- |
  

- I know this.
- |
  

- Maybe, and I hate to say this, I know it's  going to be taken the wrong way.
- |
  

- Okay.
- |
  

- You know, I look at some of my friends,  some of them who work on, say, Wall Street, or at, you know, one of those  dot-com companies, and, hey, I mean, I know, I know, I'm Earth Day, I'm out  there saving the planet.
- |
  

- Well, I mean, sure, great, that's a great line for a sunny  day on campus, but, Christ, I just can not date another girl in Birkenstocks,  you know.
- |
  

- Not that I'm trying to get with like lead counsel for Exxon, but.
- |
  

- And  then there's this.
- |
  

- A few months ago, back when I was still.
- |
  

- Arbor  Day, the two of us decided to splurge -- I mean, neither of us had taken a  vacation, a  real  vacation, in  soooo  long -- anyway, we decide to go down to  the Bahamas for a long weekend.
- |
  

- And, I mean, I've got to tell you, it was  just so nice, you know.
- |
  

- But that, that stuff takes money, you know.
- |
  

- Pause] So  nice.
- |
  

- Warm and with the beach and everything.
- |
  

- And it was great with us.
- |
  

- And  then we get back here, and it's, it's, well.
- |
  

- It gets you to thinking, you  know.
- |
  

- It just makes you think is all.
- "Interviewer: Well."
- |
  

- Any final thoughts?
- "Earth Day: [Sigh] Yeah, yeah."
- |
  

- Sure.
- |
  

- Everyone should go and check out  those new electric cars.
- |
  

- Really.
- |
  

- They're really something.
- "Interviewer: Earth Day, thank you very much for taking the time to  speak with us."
- "Earth Day: Of course, anytime, really."
- |
  

- Thanks.

  This Saturday, April 22, Earth Day turns thirty. We recently caught up 
  with
  Earth Day for a pre-birthday interview.
  Interviewer: Happy Birthday.
  Earth Day: Yeah, yeah. Thanks.
  Interviewer: You don't sound too excited.
  Earth Day: No, no... It's good. A little weird, I guess. I mean, 
  thirty.
  Fuck,
  right?
  Interviewer: Well, you must at least be pleased with this year's 
  celebration
  -- 4,500
  organizations planning events in 180 countries.
  Earth Day: Yeah, yeah. Should be good.
  Interviewer: Have you decided where you'll be?
  Earth Day: No, not yet. I don't know, I'm actually thinking about just
  sitting
  this one out, maybe getting some dinner with a few friends, something
  simple. I
  mean, what am I gonna do? Go out  and do a bunch of shots or something?
  Interviewer: Is... is that what you usually do on Earth Day?
  Earth Day: No. Course not. It's a serious day. Christ, usually I'm out 
  there
  trying to get people inspired to save the Earth and what have you. 
  [Pause]
  When
  I was younger, sure, I'd go out, maybe get a little wild. But, hell, 
  now
  I'm such a lightweight. Three drinks and I'm a puddle. Sorta sad if you
  think about it.
  Interviewer: Sad that you get drunk after only three drinks?
  Earth Day: Okay, okay. I'm not saying it's as sad as global warming or
  plastic... stuff. But, well...  I'm sorry, I don't know what I'm 
  saying.
  Really.
  It's just... strange. Thirty. The big three-oh. Thirty. Man, you know 
  it's
  one
  thing to be 27, you're 27, you're out there. You're a kid. People think
  you're a
