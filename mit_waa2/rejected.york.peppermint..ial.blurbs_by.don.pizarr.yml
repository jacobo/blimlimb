- When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I get the cool sensation of flying down Sunset Boulevard on a windy day at 120 miles an hour, narrowly avoiding pedestrians and jumping over a construction roadblock that would make them Duke boys very, very jealous!
- When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I get the sensation of having the life of a normal person and not someone who got her innocence stolen in the back of a '72 Chevrolet Vega and left as a single mother, trying to wring a child-support check from the worthless bastard of a father so the kid can have a fucking Christmas this year.
- When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I get the sensation of the life draining out of a man's body as I crush his windpipe, screaming, "So, I'm a bitch, huh?
- |
  

- I'm the bitch?
- |
  

- Who's the bitch now?
- |
  

- Who's the fucking bitch now, bitch!
- When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I don't get any sensation.
- |
  

- I feel nothing.
- |
  

- Absolutely nothing.
- |
  

- Please .
- |
  

- When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I feel the sensation of the Lord's righteous anger as he reveals his plan to use me as his holy instrument of judgment!
- |
  

- It's all right there between the lines of the ingredients list!
- "When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie\x97 Whoa!"
- |
  

- Holy crap, check out these colors.
- |
  

- Dude, your leg just turned into a chicken.
- |
  

- Dude, it's fuckin' singing to me!
- |
  

- Dude!
- When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I get the sensation of being curled in a ball inside a cold, dark cave filled with my darkest, most paralyzing fears.
- |
  

- Maybe if I stay really, really still, the clowns won't find me when they come out of the mirror.
- |
  

- Shh!
- Get the sensation.
