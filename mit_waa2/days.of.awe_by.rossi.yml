- NEW YORK, NEW YORK&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;On September 16th, after spending every day since the 11th walking up and down the West Side Highway, trying to volunteer but finding no one who would take me, a woman whose wedding I was supposed to cater called to tell me it was canceled because the city had turned her party space, Seamen's Church Institute, from a maritime museum and party location near the South Street Seaport into a home for hundreds of rescue crews.
- |
  

- There was no electricity, no plumbing and no running water, and they were trying to feed, clothe and give counsel to anyone who could get to them.
- By the time I showed up at Seamen's, Billy and Dominic were already there, unloading trucks filled with supplies.
- |
  

- Billy and Dominic are the security guards at the Institute, sweet men whom I've gotten to be pals with over many years of catering events there.
- |
  

- Dominic's head was wrapped in a flag, and he hadn't shaved in days.
- |
  

- They were both wide-eyed and pale.
- "\"We were trapped in the tunnel when it happened,\""
- |
  

- Billy said.
- |
  

- "\"I had to walk out and leave Dominic."
- |
  

- He told me just go, go.
- The best man at Dominic's wedding is among the missing.
- |
  

- "\"There's no way!"
- |
  

- He was on the 76th floor!
- "\" Dominic said."
- |
  

- "\"I can't think about it."
- |
  

- Just keep moving!
- |
  

- I've been here since Day One, haven't been home in a week.
- It didn't take much to get me on board.
- |
  

- "\"She's a chef,\""
- |
  

- Dominic told the man in charge.
- The man in charge gave me a volunteer pass, a hard hat, and a ventilator mask, and I was put on a pick-up truck en route to ground zero.
- "\"She's going to St."
- |
  

- Paul's!
- "\" someone said."
- "\"Where's St."
- |
  

- Paul's?
- "\" I asked the driver."
- "\"Next door to the Millennium Hotel."
- |
  

- They say it's stable.
- We were led through police barricades and armed guards until the truck finally dropped us off at the church.
- What I saw was an old brown church, with a row of port-a-johns to the right and a long stretch of tables to the left.
- |
  

- The tables were covered with everything from hot dogs to thermoses filled with coffee.
- |
  

- There were boxes of doughnuts, eye solution, Band-Aids, hundreds of apples, and thousands of bottles of Gatorade on ice.
- |
  

- Dozens of firefighters, cops and construction workers were in line to eat, and a small group of women were doing their best to keep up with the hot dog requests on two small backyard barbecue grills.
- I added coals to the dying fires, threw on a few more packs of hot dogs and looked for anything resembling a pair of tongs.
- St.
- |
  

- Paul's dated back to 1762.
- |
  

- It had been the place George Washington prayed, and here it stood still, covered in dust and dirty but unharmed.
- |
  

- "Each step leading into the chapel held a different box of clothing or supplies: socks, flannel shirts, work gloves, second-hand hard-hats."
- |
  

- Inside, on some of the wooden pews, policemen sat collecting their thoughts.
- |
  

- Soldiers napped in the back rows.
- My grills were set up in front of the church's cemetery.
- |
  

- Two-hundred-year-old tombstones, so old their inscriptions had long since eroded, poked out from piles of burnt and charred papers from the World Trade Center.
- |
  

- I looked at one piece of paper, a bit of banking business of some kind, a cover letter from a fax.
- "\"Have you been given the drill yet?"
- "\" a woman asked me."
- |
  

- She was stuffing the hot dogs into buns.
- "\"No.\""
- "\"If you hear the alarm, you've got to run around and out of the gate."
- |
  

- Then run as fast as you can, that way toward the Seaport.
- "\"Okay,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- On my second day grilling for the workers, I was taken on a cold drink-run to the place called the Hole.
- |
  

- I went with one of the guys, pushing a wheelbarrow filled with ice and Gatorade.
- |
  

- The Hole is the deep, collapsed area at ground zero.
- |
  

- The Hole is adjacent to the Pile, where the debris is piled more than seven stories high.
- Soldiers guarding the Hole let us by, allowing us to go to the tent set up less than one hundred feet from the debris of the second tower.
- |
  

- Smoke and steam rose out of the wreckage as firefighters on their fresh-air breaks sat unfazed a few feet away.
- |
  

- Nothing I'd seen on the news had prepared me for this.
- |
  

- Sharp burnt bits of metal stuck up fifty feet or a hundred feet&nbsp;&151;&nbsp;I have no idea how high.
- |
  

- I had to crane my neck to find the top of the debris.
- |
  

- Shards of bent, broken metal rose up over my head.
- |
  

- The background was total destruction.
- "\"I'll take one of those!"
- "\" a silver-haired firefighter said, and I handed him a Gatorade."
- "\"Where you from?"
- "\" he asked."
- "\"I live here,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- He took off his helmet and ran his fingers along his scalp.
- |
  

- "\"I'm sorry what they did to your city."
- |
  

- We just flew in from California to help out.
- I said thanks and felt dizzy from the sight I was still catching in my peripheral vision.
- The tent was full of firefighters, and they cheered when we poured ice into their cooler of warm sodas and energy drinks.
- |
  

- We handed around the cold Gatorades.
- "\"I haven't had something cold to drink since 6 a.m."
- |
  

- "\" one of the guys said."
- |
  

- It was sometime after noon.
- |
  

- Later that day, Seamen's delivered two hunks of steel they'd welded into grills.
- |
  

- They were four-foot-long pits filled with charcoal that sent up smoke and fire so intense I had to throw down a burger and then jump back.
- |
  

- The legs were too tall, causing Hector, the tallest griller among us, to stand on milk crates just to flip the burgers.
- |
  

- I kept up on the backyard grills.
- When shifts changed, fifty rescue workers at a time showed up hungry for burgers.
- |
  

- They settled for hot dogs only when we ran out of burgers.
- |
  

- Someone said we fed a thousand people on my second day.
- "\"You guys are the best,\""
- |
  

- Queens.
- "\"No. You're the hero,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"Nah."
- |
  

- We're all in this together.
- |
  

- It's you guys feeding us and the people who run up with eye wash the second you rub your eyes, and the people cheering you on as you drive in.
- |
  

- That's the reason I can do what I do, because you all do what you do.
- "\"Thank you,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"Do you know how many times I've heard that since I've been out here?"
- |
  

- I can't even count them.
- "\" He walked away shaking his head."
- There was an air about ground zero that was not filled with sadness so much as something like love.
- |
  

- No one looked as though they had slept.
- Steve, an out-of-work actor, had been there for a week.
- |
  

- He threw foil-wrapped hot dogs directly into the Hole.
- |
  

- The men working down there caught them.
- "\"More!"
- |
  

- More!
- |
  

- I need at least a hundred hot dogs,"
- |
  

- Steve said.
- |
  

- He was wired and pushy, but none of us took it to heart.
- Scott supervised the many drug store and clothing donations.
- |
  

- He slept on a blanket on the floor of the church for a week.
- "\"Are you with the church?"
- "\" I asked him."
- "\"Nah, I just found my way out here."
- A pastor from another church came once to deliver ice and stayed for a week.
- |
  

- His job was simple.
- |
  

- He ran to Costco six times a day and bought all the burgers and dogs he could carry then drove them back to ground zero.
- |
  

- Things changed on my third day.
- |
  

- There had been no official statement, but everyone knew the rescue mission had become a clean-up mission.
- |
  

- The pace of the workers slowed.
- |
  

- There were no more news crews and no hurry in the air.
- |
  

- People started to break down.
- The dogs sent out to sniff for survivors had become depressed from only finding bodies.
- |
  

- The crews took turns hiding, so the shepherds and labs could find them.
- |
  

- When the dog sniffed out the guy who was hiding, they received hearty praise and hugs.
- I went with a relief run to the Hole and handed out packets of trail mix to the crews.
- |
  

- They loved the chance to eat something healthy and took handfuls of the packets.
- |
  

- A sign on a nearby dumpster read, "Airplane parts, FBI.
- The men have a look on their faces that reads, "It's over.
- The Board of Health sent inspectors to make sure we wore plastic gloves.
- |
  

- They asked us to wrap the apples in foil and cover the grills.
- |
  

- The dust, they felt, was a health hazard.
- "\"We're pretty sanitary over here,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"Are you worried we might be creating a health problem?"
- "\"More like we're worried about your health,\""
- |
  

- One of the girls said they think the bodies might be creating a biohazard.
- We were told that they would shut us down soon.
- "\"These guys are going to be down here for months,\""
- |
  

- "\"We want to come up with a long-term way to deal with this, working with the local restaurants that have been closed."
- The inspectors told us not to use the huge steel grills, as they have no covers, so we added a third backyard barbecue grill, and I ran back and forth, turning hot dogs and replacing the covers on each of the grills.
- A truckload of replacement volunteers arrived to give us a break, but no one wanted to go.
- "\"I think tomorrow might be the last day they let us do this,\""
- |
  

- Scott said, instructing the new crew on how to sort clothes and supplies.
- |
  

- "\"I'll be here for as long as they'll let me stay."
- I stayed until my eyes were blurry from smoke and then caught a pick-up truck back to the Seaport.
- |
  

- Crowds of people took snapshots of us as we drove past, this motley crew in the bed of a truck with the American flag flying off a makeshift flagpole.
- |
  

- On my last day at ground zero, I skipped Rosh Hashanah services and got out to the site early, but I was delivering food to a gloomy crew.
- |
  

- The Board of Health had shut down our grills and any food production.
- |
  

- We were allowed only to dole out pre-cooked burgers and sandwiches.
- The trucks from Seamen's Church brought over a thousand peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
- |
  

- None of the rescue workers was interested in peanut butter and jelly.
- "\"No more burgers,\""
- |
  

- His hands were raw, beaten.
- |
  

- He said he'd been digging out nothing but body parts all day.
- "\"They just want us to pack up,\""
- |
  

- Roger, the volunteer who seemed the most like our leader.
- |
  

- He wore a hard hat with an American flag taped to it.
- I stepped into the church in search of serving utensils and found a dozen rescue workers sitting in the pews, most of them with tears in their eyes.
- I took my last walk to ground zero.
- |
  

- I delivered a bag of a hundred peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to the guards at the Pile.
- |
  

- We were no longer allowed in to deliver them ourselves.
- Back at the long row of donation tables set in front of the burnt-out shell of 5 World Trade Center, Brian, one of the guys who works for my catering company, sorted through boxes of underwear and t-shirts.
- |
  

- He was organizing things to be sent elsewhere, perhaps to the Salvation Army.
- As we commiserated on how this was a strange place to spend Rosh Hashanah, an amazing thing happened.
- An army soldier with a long white beard stacked several Styrofoam crates one on top of another and placed a plastic shelf used to transport bread on top the crates, forming a table.
- |
  

- He covered the table with a blue velvet cloth on which was embroidered the Star of David.
- Then he set down a prayer book for the days of awe and a shofar.
- As he began to recite the prayers, a group of Jewish soldiers gathered around him.
- |
  

- Brian, some Jewish volunteers, and I heard the prayers and joined in.
- Then, in front of the worst vision of death and ruin any of us will probably ever see, he blew the shofar.
- |
  

- The sweet-sour mournful sound of the ram's horn pierced the air and resonated into the distance.
- The women began to cry.
- |
  

- We kissed each other.
- |
  

- "\"La Shanah Tovah!"
- "\" we said, holding each other."
- |
  

- We were all strangers.
- |
  

- We probably would never see each other again, but we kissed and hugged like family.
- The soldier with the shofar wore a tallis made of camouflage.
- |
  

- "\"Thank you so much,\""
- |
  

- I said to him.
- "\"Ah, it's nothing,\""
- |
  

- "\"This is the army."
- |
  

- I do this all the time.
