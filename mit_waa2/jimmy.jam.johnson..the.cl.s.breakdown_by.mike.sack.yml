- |
  

- Sixty-six degrees, with just the slightest chance of rain.
- |

- |
  

- And guess what?
- |
  

- Zang-zang-zang!
- |
  

- That's the Z-106 party siren!
- |
  

- My wife just sent me an invitation.
- |
  

- You like weddings?
- |
  

- How about white weddings?
- |
  

- Billy Idol on the Z-Rock!
- |
  

- "\"Foghat."
- |
  

- It's 8:14 on a Monday morning and I'm taking a 'Slow Ride' to the end of my shift.
- |
  

- Or to hell.
- |
  

- Or to my town home off I-95.
- |
  

- My lady and I once made love in a back booth of an Arthur Treacher's.
- |

- |
  

- Last song of the day, folks.
- |
  

- Y'all think I'm a nice guy?
- |
  

- "You won't after this story: Gonna show up at my ex's wedding and punch the grad student in the nose."
- |
  

- The spray of blood will be ferocious.
- |
  

- Yours truly's gonna be arrested.
- |
  

- The Big Dawg is up next to take you into the noon hour.
- |
  

- The Big Dawg is gonna play that rock-and-roll music nice and loud.
- |
  

- So, until the morn, keep it on the up side, but don't keep it down your pants, because it could bite a leper.
- |
  

- That phrase is trademarked.
- |
  

- Just performed a somersault in my mind!
- |
  

- You like gymnastics?
- |
  

- I don't.
- |
  

- Hey, what can I say?
- |
  

- Life's Been Good.
- |
  

- You think so, Joe?
- |
  

- Gotta disagree.
- |
  

- Take it away, bro .
