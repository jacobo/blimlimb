- SOLOMON
- Sure, everybody brings up the baby-slicing as the prime example of the wisdom of Solomon.

- But what nobody ever mentions was that that was his solution to everything.

- Contract dispute?

- Divorce proceeding?

- Jaywalking arrest?
- |
  

- Hey, let's cut this baby in half and see if that settles things!
- |
  

- Solomon was kind of a nut.

- JEAN-PAUL SARTRE
- "\"Hell is other people,\""

- Jean-Paul Sartre once observed, which marked the last time anyone threw the ungrateful bastard a surprise party.

- CUBA GOODING, JR.
- Cuba Gooding, Jr.

- Which means that, somewhere in Los Angeles, there is a screenwriter whose script was deemed "not good enough for Cuba Gooding, Jr.
- "\" That's got to hurt."

- ART GARFUNKEL
- Art Garfunkel seems like the kind of a person who'd Google himself compulsively, which means that, sooner or later, he's going to find this item.

- "If I'm right: Hi, Art Garfunkel!"

- PIERRE DE FERMAT
- "For three and a half centuries, Pierre de Fermat has captivated mathematicians with a single sentence: \"I have discovered a truly remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain."
- "\" Many people think that this proves Fermat was a brilliant mathematician."

- ALBERT CAMUS
- Albert Camus famously stated that "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn". Of course, he's dead now, which seems like a pretty resounding counterargument to that theory.

  SOLOMON
  Sure, everybody brings up the baby-slicing as the prime example of
  the wisdom of Solomon. But what nobody ever mentions was that that
  was his solution to everything. Contract dispute? Divorce proceeding?
  Jaywalking arrest? Hey, let's cut this baby in half and see if that
  settles things! Solomon was kind of a nut.

  JEAN-PAUL SARTRE
  "Hell is other people," Jean-Paul Sartre once observed, which marked
  the last time anyone threw the ungrateful bastard a surprise party.
  - - - -
  CUBA GOODING, JR.
  Cuba Gooding, Jr. has, presumably, sometime in the past few years,
  declined to appear in something. Which means that, somewhere in Los
  Angeles, there is a screenwriter whose script was deemed "not good
  enough for Cuba Gooding, Jr." That's got to hurt.

  ART GARFUNKEL
  Art Garfunkel seems like the kind of a person who'd Google himself
  compulsively, which means that, sooner or later, he's going to find
  this item. If I'm right: Hi, Art Garfunkel!

  For three and a half centuries, Pierre de Fermat has captivated
  mathematicians with a single sentence: "I have discovered a truly
  remarkable proof which this margin is too small to contain." Many
  people think that this proves Fermat was a brilliant mathematician. I
  would argue that it proves he was a brilliant self-promoter.
  Furthermore, I have a truly remarkable cure for world hunger, which
  this page is too small to contain.
