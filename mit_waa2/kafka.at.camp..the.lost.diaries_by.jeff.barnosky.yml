- June 16, 1897&#8212;First night at Camp Schelsen.
- |
  

- Underneath my top bunk, as I write this, Herbie Willenberg is looking at naked pictures of women with names like Helga and Ute.
- |
  

- I loathe his very existence, but at the same time the sight of the women without their clothes fascinates me.
- |
  

- Herbie breathes heavily.
- |
  

- He struggles ambiguously underneath the covers.
- |
  

- The counselors, with their muscles and their short shorts, giggle knowingly.
- |
  

- They don't care.
- |
  

- That's what boys his age do.
- |
  

- They look at me with much heavier gazes.
- |
  

- My existence perplexes them.
- |
  

- Throws off their sense of the universe.
- |
  

- I understand how they feel.
- |
  

- June 18, 1897&#8212;I've spent the past two days lost in the woods, on what my counselors call a hike.
- |
  

- The concept seems ludicrous and they were brutally unsympathetic to my concerns.
- |
  

- The first few minutes are bearable, but I begin to sense that we aren't going anywhere, that our destination is the same lonely, rat-infested hut where we begin.
- |
  

- I wonder aloud about the necessity of it all, asking why we couldn't just stay in the cabin and cut out the middleman.
- "\"It's called a hike,\""
- |
  

- "\"But why are we doing it?"
- |
  

- What's the purpose?
- |
  

- We end where we start.
- |
  

- We start where we end.
- "\"You can look for birds and flowers and stuff,\""
- |
  

- "\"I don't understand what you are saying."
- "\"It's nature!"
- "\" The counselor roars."
- |
  

- "\"Stop being such a freaky weirdo."
- I ask questions to get closer to some unknowable truth.
- |
  

- The distance just seems to grow.
- |
  

- July 1, 1897&#8212;My Birthday.
- |
  

- I have not told anyone and now that it is approaching midnight, I will not have to.
- |
  

- The days are nothing but struggle.
- |
  

- Struggle to survive.
- |
  

- Some boys had to be stripped down.
- |
  

- Whipped in front of everyone.
- |
  

- They did not understand how wonderful Camp Schelsen could be.
- |
  

- They spit on people.
- |
  

- They threw rocks at squirrels.
- |
  

- I could not look away.
- |
  

- The cruelty was too beautiful.
- |
  

- It opened up the universe.
- |
  

- July 7, 1897&#8212;I spend most nights writing.
- |
  

- Postcards home.
- |
  

- Letters to my girlfriend, Laura, who before I left promised that she liked me, but could never promise that her liking me would ever become  like  liking me.
- |
  

- I can't escape the memory of the night when she allowed me to touch her breast over her shirt for a count of five.
- |
  

- Exhilaration.
- |
  

- Wonder.
- |
  

- Despair.
- |
  

- Guilt.
- |
  

- A dark, long-beaked bird circled over our heads, squawking threats of death.
- Does Laura have pubes yet?
- |
  

- Will she let me see?
- |
  

- July 10,1897&#8212;In Arts and Crafts, that humid hut, the teacher stops.
- |
  

- He looks down.
- |
  

- I look up.
- |
  

- I am working on something intricate, something simultaneously nothing and everything.
- |
  

- It is made of paper.
- "\"I always wanted you to admire my origami,\""
- |
  

- I say.
- "\"I do."
- |
  

- I do admire it.
- "\"Well, you shouldn't,\""
- |
  

- I say.
- "\"You're a weird little dude, Franzie."
- |
  

- July 13, 1897&#8212;Every morning I wake up, after wet and uneasy dreams to the same horror, a giant bug crawling up my chest, daring me to kill it.
- |
  

- One morning, it speaks to me.
- "\"You cannot smash me,\""
- |
  

- "\"I am you."
- I go to Counselor K. He is sick of my complaints, sick of having to be creative with his response.
- "\"Franzie!"
- |
  

- You're not on trial here,"
- |
  

- "\"It's camp for chrissakes."
- |
  

- Have fun.
- |
  

- July 17, 1897&#8212;Today we walked deeper and straighter into the dark forest then we had ever been before.
- |
  

- My dread and despair reached immense levels until we came to a clearing.
- |
  

- There we saw a single tree with a ladder nailed to the side.
- |
  

- On the tree was a long, thin rope that stretched for what seemed like miles until it hit another tree.
- Counselor K called it a Zip Line.
- As I slid across the line, countless times, I felt as if I was flying through the forest, suddenly changed from a child who feels the pressure of every pound of gravity on my body to a weightless bird zooming through the forest.
- |
  

- For a moment, even my writing seemed unimportant.
- Everyone alive should fly.
- |
  

- July 20, 1897&#8212;My writing is nothing but a lost echo into the chasm of literature.
- |
  

- I have been working on stories that I want to capture the essential vacuum at the heart of human existence, but I keep inserting scantily clad girls and 14-year-old boys with dark complexions and beaky noses.
- "Story idea: A beautiful, witty actress wakes up one morning to find that she has been transformed into a giant iguana."
- Can it go anywhere?
- |
  

- Can I make it sexy?
- |
  

- August 5, 1897&#8212;The response from those who listen to my stories as I read them aloud is puzzling.
- |
  

- At lunch, in the cafeteria, they laugh uncontrollably, especially at the iguana story.
- |
  

- The reaction is so disturbing that I end up being pleased by it, and half way through the story, I am laughing almost too hard to continue.
- Herbie Willenberg laughs so violently that milk comes out of his nose.
- |
  

- He cries from the pleasure of the pain.
- This is what existence is.
- |
  

- A perpetual emptiness, with a few good jokes thrown in the mix.
- |
  

- August 8, 1897&#8212;Tomorrow I go home.
- |
  

- Camp Schelsen closes for the winter.
- |
  

- After our talent show, at which I juggled and received silent, puzzled response, I walked around aimlessly.
- |
  

- In the middle of the camp, where we had spent the summer roasting marshmallows at the bonfire, I saw a giant contraption, intricately assembled, reaching towards the moon.
- |
  

- Next to the machine stood a man, beckoning me.
- "\"That's a curious device."
- |
  

- What is it?
- "\" I asked."
- "\"You should know what it is,\""
- |
  

- "\"Why?"
- "\"Yeah."
- |
  

- I'm just messing with you.
- |
  

- It's scaffolding.
- |
  

- We're hanging a goodbye banner.
- I turned away from the man and walked back to my bunk.
- |
  

- I tried to write something that even touched the depth of my confusion, my despair.
- |
  

- All I had were stories of kids making out in the woods or learning about life on a canoe.
- One day, I will destroy everything I've ever written.
