- Oh, hi, Jane.
- |
  

- Wow, you OK?
- |
  

- You look really tired.
- |
  

- Didn't sleep well last night?
- |
  

- Sure, sure, I know what you mean.
- |
  

- Little Conner kept me up late, too.
- |
  

- Such big lungs for such a little person!
- |
  

- And kidneys, too, probably.
- |
  

- Oh, nothing, I was just mumbling to myself.
- |
  

- I didn't sleep too well, either.
- |
  

- And you know they say that conserving energy and maximizing sleep is really the best way for us to get through this crisis.
- |
  

- You can look that up if you want, but it's definitely true.
- |
  

- I said we should have taken a left at that river.
- |
  

- Which way did George say again?
- |
  

- He said to take a right, right?
- |
  

- Hmmm.
- |
  

- What's that, Randy?
- |
  

- Me?
- |
  

- Really?
- |
  

- No, no, I actually lost a few.
- |
  

- Yeah, these pants are just really baggy.
- |
  

- Hand-me-downs, actually.
- |
  

- Oh, look, is Tom's top pants button undone again?
- |
  

- Two days, you say?
- |
  

- That's nothing.
- |
  

- I haven't seen him wear a belt for over a week.
- |
  

- Jacob, got a minute?
- |
  

- Look, I'm just saying that "women and children first" has been sort of a golden rule for centuries and I think we'd be unwise to go against it. That's all I'm saying.
- |
  

- Morning, Greg.
- |
  

- Too bad you crashed so early last night.
- |
  

- Yeah, a bunch of us stayed up late telling jokes and sharing stories.
- |
  

- Huh?
- |
  

- Oh, your wife was fine.
- |
  

- Yeah, Jim was looking after her to make sure she stayed warm.
- |
  

- And they do say that skin-on-skin contact is the best way for us to keep warm.
- |
  

- And I guess ear nibbling, also.
- |
  

- Who knows, really?
- |
  

- Didn't you think Randy's joke last night was racist?
- |
  

- Yeah, really racist.
- |
  

- No, no, not just card tricks.
- |
  

- I do magic, too.
- |
  

- And, of course, those shadow puppets that were cracking everyone up a few days ago.
- |
  

- And, personally, I loved your James Polk impressions.
- |
  

- But Larry?
- |
  

- What's he bringing to the table?
- |
  

- Oh, this?
- |
  

- Yeah, it started a few weeks ago.
- |
  

- Bad, bad rash, huh?
- |
  

- Well, I'm hopeful, but I think it really might be a sign of a deep and toxic infection.
- |
  

- What do you mean you haven't noticed it before?
- |
  

- I've been itching for weeks.
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- Oh, that's just insane.
- |
  

- A cheese grater could not possibly have caused this redness.
- |
  

- Yeah, well, bite me, Janet.
- |
  

- OK, back up, Randy, that was just a joke.
