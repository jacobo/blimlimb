- Sure.

- That's just a lettuce and tomato sandwich.

- If they just ran out of bacon, and you still call it a B.L.
- T.
- |
  

- B.L.
- T.

- Would you eat that?
- "\"No, because if it doesn't have bacon in it it's not a B.L."

- Why wouldn't you eat a virgin B.L.

- I remember one evening I suggested we go to a new sushi place I'd heard about.

- He smiled at me, a smile full of patience, suffering, and disappointment - he'd been porketarian for years already and was used to this sort of thing.
- |
  

- "\"Can I eat there?"
- "\" he asked."

- "\"Well, sure -\""

- I said, "Ohhhh.

- Darn, darn, darn!

- I hadn't yet learned to think like a porketarian.
- "Nowadays I know better: nowadays I wouldn't take him to a Japanese restaurant that only served sushi; I'd take him somewhere where I could have sushi and he could have a pork cutlet on rice or noodles."

- And I'd make sure to have a bite of the cutlet before I kissed him.

  My boyfriend is a porketarian. Which can make dining out a bit of a challenge.
  At home we've got the routine down, it's second nature: we use lard in place of butter or oil; we always have bacon bits, as well as regular sliced bacon, ham (deli and whole), spare ribs, pork loin, pork rinds, and pickled pig's feet on hand. If we're making soup, we throw a hambone in there; for vegetables, we cook them with a bit of salt pork; and salads get tossed with bacon bits. Once you get the hang of it, it's not so difficult to "porketarianize" your kitchen.

Sometimes we cook for our non-porketarian friends, and they're shocked at how good a porketarian meal can be. "You'd never guess this has pork in it!" they say.
  When we venture out of our neighborhood though, then we have to get creative, and read menus carefully. The porketarian (and those who eat with him) will quickly discover Chinese food to be their mainstay and best friend: most things on the Dim Sum menu, for instance, have pork in them, and of course, there's always pork fried rice, Chinese spare ribs - at the Chinese restaurant you may have to ask what doesn't have pork in it.

  "What about a B.L.T., hold the bacon?"
  "That's not a B.L.T. anymore. That's just a lettuce and tomato sandwich."
  "Yeah it is. If they just ran out of bacon, and you still call it a B.L.T., it's a B.L.T. without bacon. Would you eat that?"
  "No, because if it doesn't have bacon in it it's not a B.L.T."
