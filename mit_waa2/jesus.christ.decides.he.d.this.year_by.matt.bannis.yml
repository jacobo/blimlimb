- Seriously, guys, no party this year.
- |
  

- I know you've all been looking forward to it, but I really just don't want to celebrate this one.
- |
  

- It's a little trite and, frankly, over the top.
- |
  

- Take a look at past celebrations; I feel overindulgent.
- |
  

- Just not my style.
- And I'm not just saying this with the expectation that you'll throw a party anyway.
- |
  

- This is no false front.
- |
  

- "This is straight talk, so listen up: I don't want a party."
- |
  

- I just want to have a relaxed, quiet night.
- |
  

- Maybe I'll go out to eat.
- |
  

- I know just the place; I think I've earned it.
- Don't even think about arranging the T.G.
- I.
- |
  

- Friday's wait staff to sing "Happy Birthday.
- "\" I'd maintain a polite smile for the duration of their song, but you better believe I'd be seriously pissed."
- |
  

- I wouldn't even eat the free dessert.
- |
  

- I'd let the ice cream melt and it would all go to waste.
- |
  

- So don't do it.
- And no gifts.
- |
  

- I always end up with shit I don't want.
- |
  

- Like frankincense.
- |
  

- And myrrh.
- |
  

- I ask for the receipt and then suddenly I'm the bad guy.
- |
  

- "Like it matters, anyway\x97what am I supposed to do with store credit at the Spice Emporium?"
- Don't be like that.
- |
  

- I'm not ungrateful.
- |
  

- I appreciate the gesture; I just don't need it, all right?
- |
  

- Save your money.
- Then there's the matter of guests.
- |
  

- Birthday parties draw people I've meticulously extracted from my social circle.
- |
  

- "It's always the same: Word gets out and invitations miraculously appear on the doorsteps of every irritating prick I've ever encountered."
- |
  

- I end up avoiding people at my own party.
- |
  

- Next thing you know, I'm cornered by Brandon Schwartz, tap-dancing my way out of 65 unreturned calls.
- And I certainly don't have the patience to put up with another drunk guy this year.
- |
  

- "Allow me to paint you the inevitable picture: He'll show up an hour early and carry on with general daftness, ignoring\x97or, rather, embracing\x97the fact that it is 1 o'clock p.m."
- |
  

- He'll then stumble around the sunroom and vomit on my throw pillows.
- |
  

- I'm looking at you, Cameron.
- Finally, there better be no surprise party.
- |
  

- You know that about me, I hate surprises.
- |
  

- I'm sorry Susan had to find that out the hard way, but maybe if she hadn't been hiding in my closet she'd still have all her teeth.
- Well, now, I hope I've made myself clear.
- |
  

- If I so much as see one party favor on the day of December 25, I swear to God I'll lose it.
