- Ed Johnson was as happy as any man who had just enjoyed a steak dinner for only four dollars and 99 cents, plus tax.
- |
  

- Patting his swollen stomach, he paid the bill and then shuffled down to the gaming floor, where Helen was busy working the slots.
- It seemed like only yesterday they had first vacationed at Chief Big Wampum's Casino and Resort.
- |
  

- Ed fondly remembered piling his wife and kids into the old Buick station wagon for the long drive from the city.
- |
  

- Every summer, they would rent the same little cabin on Lake Teepee and play miniature golf until the moon rose high over the shimmering water.
- |
  

- He sighed.
- |
  

- The kids were grown up, and the Buick died years ago.
- |
  

- But Helen was still with him, beautiful as ever.
- Ed found her straddling a stool between two machines, where, for the last 12 hours, she had been plunking in nickels and pushing buttons, pausing only to reload every few minutes with a fresh Virginia Slims.
- |
  

- When one of the machines began spewing coins, Ed sidled up to her.
- |
  

- "\"My gal's got the golden touch tonight,\""
- |
  

- Helen felt his rough, familiar hands and looked up, smiling.
- |
  

- "\"Eddie,\""
- |
  

- "\"my legs are asleep and I gotta take a dump."
- |
  

- Wanna help me up?
- "\"Of course, my sweet,\""
- |
  

- Ed replied.
- |
  

- "\"Of course."
- |
  

- No one in the Burger King saw Tina slide her Whopper under the table and stuff it with the head and torso of a freshly killed rat, which she had covertly removed from her purse moments earlier.
- |
  

- No one, that is, but Glenn.
- |
  

- He had watched the lovely but sad young woman from the moment she had walked into the restaurant.
- |
  

- And now, as she was surely about to take a bite of the adulterated sandwich and let loose a hideous shriek, he sat down across the table from her.
- |
  

- Shocked, Tina dropped her Whopper.
- |
  

- "\"You don't have to do this,\""
- |
  

- Glenn whispered.
- |
  

- "\"I've figured out a way I can pay for the wedding."
- |
  

- I'll even have enough money to get you that engagement ring I promised.
- "\"But how?"
- "\" Tina asked, fighting to hold back the tears."
- |
  

- "\"Love of my life, how can you possibly come up with all that money?"
- "\" Glenn smiled grimly."
- |
  

- Slowly, he lifted the bun of his fish sandwich like the lid of a jewelry box.
- |
  

- To Tina's surprise and delight, the fried cod fillet was studded with small pieces of broken glass, which sparkled like diamonds in the flickering fluorescent light.
- |
  

- "Standing in line one afternoon at a caf\xE9, two strangers, Jason and Maria, struck up a conversation and soon discovered a shared interest in Dave Matthews."
- |
  

- Then there was a joke made about ravioli.
- |
  

- An hour later, their souls had embraced.
- As he sipped the last of his coffee, Jason stared approvingly at Maria's glowing skin, pouting lips, and seductive curves.
- |
  

- And from across the table, Maria admired his perfectly coifed blond hair, preternaturally chiseled arms and chest, and a beaming smile that never seemed to falter.
- |
  

- At that moment, nothing mattered to them but each other.
- |
  

- They held hands and discussed the heated intercourse they would enjoy later that day.
- Suddenly, Jason hesitated.
- |
  

- Things were going too quickly, and he had been hurt before.
- |
  

- "\"Whoa, this is crazy,\""
- |
  

- "\"Maria, I don't even know your last name!"
- Her last name.
- |
  

- For a moment, Maria said nothing.
- |
  

- If there was one thing her family held dear, it was that name.
- |
  

- Her beloved grandfather had carried that name with him to Ellis Island almost a century ago.
- |
  

- Later, he had refused to change it to sound more "American," and had endured with quiet dignity a lifetime of jeers and threats and other small-minded cruelties, even from his closest colleagues at the yam-canning factory. His pride in that name had been unshakable. So was Maria's pride in her grandfather. She cleared her throat.
- "\"Clementine ."
- |
  

- Maria Clementine,"
- |
  

- Maria Pukestain-Hitlerpimple, fiddling nervously with her tea infuser.
- |
  

- "\"What a beautiful name,\""
- |
  

- Jason replied, itching and sweating beneath his ponderous costume and its scratchy inner lining.
- |
  

- Hearing this, Maria smiled wider than she'd ever smiled before.
- |
  

- "\"And you're a beautiful person!"
- "\" she said with excitement and relief, squeezing his mittlike hand."
- |
  

- "\"Oh, Tom Tasty, we were meant to be together."
- |
  

- I just know it!
- "\" It was only then Jason Feldstein remembered he was still dressed as Tom Tasty, cartoon mascot for a national chain of buffet restaurants."
- |
  

- Dear God , he thought, looking out the window at a nearby street corner.
- |
  

- I forgot to hand out the rest of those fliers!
- Beautiful, starstruck Maria talked dreamily about the romantic evening ahead, and Jason tried to nod politely as he searched for the strength to confess his secret.
- |
  

- But the top-heavy Tom Tasty head exaggerated the nod, pulling Jason's own head up and then down with terrific force, like he could not have agreed with her more.
