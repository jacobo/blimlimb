- Listen, Sandy, you're a nice girl.
- |
  

- You've got an OK voice.
- |
  

- You seem like you can call the shots.
- |
  

- But when all is said and done, the biggest thing you have on your side is your huge rack.
- I'm sure you've got brains, too.
- |
  

- Hell, we all do.
- |
  

- But that's not what counts in this biz.
- |
  

- That's not what's gonna make you a star.
- |
  

- And I can't make a star out of someone who can't make the cut.
- |
  

- Hell, a big rack helps.
- |
  

- But it's not gonna make the cut.
- We've seen you before, and we like your style.
- |
  

- We like your attitude, the sparkle in your eyes, the fight in your face.
- |
  

- But you just can't hit those notes.
- |
  

- Your ass is too wide, and you can't hit those notes.
- I've gotta lotta girls going for this part.
- |
  

- Girls who are good.
- |
  

- Girls who are stars.
- |
  

- And you just ain't on that level yet.
- |
  

- You're good, but you're not there.
- |
  

- You need to work on a lotta things; you gotta get your chops.
- |
  

- "The one thing you don't need to work on\x97the thing that's doing half the work for you\x97is your giant rack."
- Where'd you get that rack, anyhow?
- |
  

- Is that from your mom?
- |
  

- I don't wanna be too creepy, but those melons look real.
- |
  

- Not the fake-boat kind, like the kind I see on some of these broads.
- |
  

- Some of those globes you could use as basketballs!
- |
  

- Slam dunk!
- |
  

- But not yours, Sandy.
- |
  

- Yours look like the real thing.
- Hey, does your back ever hurt from carrying around those jugs in front?
- |
  

- Once, I had to change a tire, only I had to carry the tire almost half a mile from the station to get it back to my wheels.
- |
  

- My back was so sore I couldn't sit up straight for days.
- |
  

- The thing is, I wonder if you've got the same problem with your rack.
- |
  

- That thing is huge, and all on your front.
- |
  

- "I'm just sitting here, and I'm thinking, and I'm wondering to myself:  Doesn't her back hurt from carrying around those enormous ta-tas?"
- You know what I'd do if you were my girl?
- |
  

- I'd take my face and I'd bury it in your mo-mos.
- |
  

- "I tell you what, if it were my choice, there'd be only one way for me to go\x97suffocation in your mo-mos."
- |
  

- Or if we were in a boxing match, but instead of gloves, you punched with your grapefruits.
- |
  

- "Smothered by your mo-mos or battered by your grapefruits: either way, you could color me a happy papa."
- What's really got me going is, you mentioned you like to go for long jogs around Lakeside Park.
- |
  

- So you say that, and I hear that, and I'm thinking, How can she handle that?
- |
  

- Aren't your bullets socking you in the face the whole time?
- |
  

- "I know you've got a harness, but gravity is gravity, kid\x97and I'm wondering why your cheeks aren't black and blue."
- Listen, baby, you're gonna be a star.
- |
  

- I want you to be a star.
- |
  

- But you just ain't there yet.
- |
  

- "If you keep working on those notes\x97and believe me, I told Chi-Chi Fernandez about you; she's gonna help you out, kid\x97I know you can make it to the bigtime."
- |
  

- I want you to make it to the bigtime.
- |
  

- But for now, the biggest thing you've got is your rack.
