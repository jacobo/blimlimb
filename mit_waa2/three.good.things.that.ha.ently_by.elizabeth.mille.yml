- It was Saturday night and my friend Jason and I were at a bar sharing a pitcher of beer.
- |
  

- We were talking about records when a woman came up to our table and held her arm over our heads.
- "\"Yes?"
- "\" Jason said."
- The woman shook her arm.
- |
  

- "\"Mistletoe."
- "\" she said."
- Jason and I looked up.
- |
  

- She was, indeed, holding mistletoe.
- "\"But, we're not a couple."
- "\" said Jason."
- The woman shook the mistletoe again and looked at us.
- "\"We are not going to kiss,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- More shaking.
- "\"Um, we're related?"
- "\" said Jason, obviously lying."
- I could see that the woman was not going to leave until she got what she wanted, so I leaned over the table and gave Jason a kiss on the cheek.
- |
  

- The woman looked unsatisfied.
- |
  

- I was afraid she was going to stick around and try to make things get more personal, but she moved her arm from above our heads and went to another table.
- The table she chose was occupied by three people.
- |
  

- The two people sitting on one side of the table were a couple, and so when the mistletoe was held above them, they kissed each other without hesitation.
- |
  

- The third person, a man, smiled at the couple and waited for the woman to leave.
- |
  

- She did not.
- |
  

- Instead, she wagged the mistletoe at him, grabbed him by the arm, and dragged him to another table where there was a woman who appeared to be dateless.
- |
  

- She sat the man down at the woman's table and held out the mistletoe.
- I watched the two people look at each other and smile weakly.
- |
  

- The man tried to get up from the table, but the mistletoe lady gave him a look and kept standing there with her arm held above them.
- It was agonizing to watch.
- |
  

- I was really glad that I was not either of those people.
- |
  

- I went to the store on Sunday night to buy eye drops.
- |
  

- As I was walking in, I heard someone call my name.
- |
  

- I looked behind me.
- |
  

- I saw a man wearing a blue hoodie and old Vans.
- "\"Do you remember me?"
- "\" he asked."
- "\"Um, no?"
- "\" I said."
- "\"Bob."
- I looked at him, clueless.
- "\"All right."
- |
  

- Hi, Bob.
- "\"Bob, your old housemate's friend."
- "\" he said."
- |
  

- "\"I worked on Mt."
- |
  

- Hood and took you snowboarding and you spent the whole afternoon falling over.
- "\"Oh!"
- "\" I said."
- |
  

- "\"Bob!"
- Bob and I spent the next few minutes catching up.
- |
  

- We talked about what we had been doing for the past six years.
- |
  

- Bob told me he had moved to California and then moved back.
- |
  

- He recently bought a car that had a dead battery so he was buying a new one at the store.
- Bob asked me what I had been doing.
- |
  

- I didn't tell him that a week before I was supposed to leave for a trip to India to meet my family the very housemate who introduced me to Bob gave notice on our apartment without telling me.
- |
  

- I had called our landlord to ask if someone could sublet my room while I was gone, and that's when she told me about my housemate.
- |
  

- She thought I knew.
- |
  

- She was really embarrassed.
- |
  

- I didn't tell him the part about spending the last seven days before my trip packing up all my things and finding a new place to live.
- |
  

- I also neglected to mention how after I got back from India I discovered that my old housemate had left me a phone bill with $200 worth of calls to Florida, to her ex-boyfriend.
- |
  

- When I called her mom to find out where she was living, her mom spoke very tersely on the telephone and then hung up on me.
- |
  

- I never got my money back.
- |
  

- I also never got back my deposit on that apartment.
- |
  

- A few months after the phone call to her mom I found out that my old housemate had moved to New York.
- Later, my boyfriend ended up renting the same apartment with two friends.
- |
  

- He lived there for a year, until the night he woke me up to tell me that he was leaving me and moving to New Hampshire.
- |
  

- We were sleeping in his bedroom, in my old bedroom.
- |
  

- After being dumped I got up, put my contact lenses on, and drove home.
- |
  

- It was two o'clock in the morning.
- |
  

- I didn't see him again until two and a half years later, when he showed up where I worked to tell me that he had moved back and was curious about what I had been up to.
- |
  

- I talked to him in a daze, forcing myself to be polite and not ask the thousands of questions that had plagued me for an entire year after he left.
- But I left all that stuff out.
- |
  

- Instead I told Bob that I had gone to India, bought a house, and played in a Patsy Cline cover band.
- When we were done talking, Bob said he had to leave and put the new battery in his car.
- |
  

- He gave me a hug, and we said goodbye.
- |
  

- He didn't suggest we exchange phone numbers and try to get together for beers sometime, and I was so glad that he didn't, because so often people say that just to leave conversations on a good note even though both people involved know that there will never be any calling or beer drinking.
- I was relieved.
- |
  

- It made me really happy.
- |
  

- It was really good running into Bob.
- |
  

- I was waiting in line at the deli around the corner from where I work.
- In front of me was a woman wearing a pink pea coat with a matching wool hat.
- She was ordering a sandwich.
- "\"I'll have a chicken chest sandwich,\""
- |
  

- "\"You mean 'chicken breast'?"
- "\" asked the man behind the counter."
- "\"I don't like that word,\""
- |
  

- "\"What word?"
- "\" the man said."
- |
  

- "\"Chicken?"
- |
