- There was once an enchanted town.
- |
  

- A witch had cast a sleeping spell over it because something about it maddened her.
- |
  

- All the townspeople were asleep so nobody could ask them what it was, and the witch refused to discuss the matter.
- |
  

- Unbeknownst to the witch, however, as the townspeople slept they all dreamed the same dream.
- |
  

- They dreamed a dream of the town.
- |
  

- They dreamed that the life of the town was carrying on as usual.
- |
  

- The grownups dreamed that they were going to work and calling home their children.
- |
  

- The children dreamed that they were going to school and running in the wind.
- |
  

- The wind dreamed it was shuddering the trees, and the trees dreamed they were growing out their leaves.
- |
  

- The leaves dreamed they spent all summer longing to escape, until finally they did.
- Not far away there was this town where all the people laughed all the time.
- |
  

- The people laughed as they worked and they laughed as they rested and they laughed as they fought.
- |
  

- And there was this other town, too, a town where all the people wept all the time.
- |
  

- They wept as they worked and they wept as they rested and they wept as they played.
- Now a baby boy was born to the laughing town, a weeping boy.
- |
  

- He slipped out of his laughing mother and when his laughing father kissed him, he wept.
- |
  

- The laughing people were startled by the weeping boy.
- |
  

- They laughed to show their astonishment.
- |
  

- The weeping boy's mother laughed a bit and took her boy to her breast.
- At the same time a baby girl was born to the weeping town, a laughing girl.
- |
  

- She slipped out of her weeping mother and when the weeping doctor smacked her, she laughed.
- |
  

- The weeping people were concerned by the laughing girl.
- |
  

- They wept to show their consternation.
- |
  

- The laughing girl's weeping mother took her girl to her breast.
- The weeping boy grew and grew until one day he was driven out of the laughing town and down the road by children throwing rocks at him, and laughing.
- |
  

- The laughing girl grew and grew until one day she was chased up the road by children who pinched her skin and wept.
- |
  

- The weeping boy from the laughing town made his way down the slippery road, and the laughing girl from the weeping town made her way up the slippery road.
- |
  

- Until they met.
- Surely the weeping boy had had enough of laughing people.
- |
  

- Surely he should have kept going and if he had, he'd have made his way to the weeping town and there he'd have met a lovely weeping girl, perhaps the pretty one with the curly hair, the one who pinched so well.
- |
  

- Surely the laughing girl had had enough of weeping people.
- |
  

- Surely she should have kept going and if she had, she'd have made her way to the laughing town and there she'd have met a lovely laughing boy, perhaps the handsome one with the sturdy shoulders, the one who liked to throw rocks.
- But they were both very tired, and their feet ached.
- |
  

- So they sat down together in the ditch and, head to head to shoulder, they fell asleep.
- |
  

- And when the full moon woke them up, they built a hut by the side of the road.
- |
  

- They made very good mates.
- Yet sometimes on the darkest nights the weeping boy dreamed he told the laughing girl to go and make her way a little further up the road, where she'd discover the laughing town and all the other people of her kind.
- |
  

- And sometimes on the brightest nights the laughing girl dreamed that she told the weeping boy to go and make his way a little further down the road, where he would find the weeping town and all the other people just like him.
- |
  

- But they were too afraid of losing each other and so neither of them ever did.
- In the first town, meanwhile, the one under the witch's spell, everyone is dreaming still.
