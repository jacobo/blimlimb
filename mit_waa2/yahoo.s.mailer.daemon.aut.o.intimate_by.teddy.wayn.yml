- "Subject: Failure notice"
- Hi.
- |
  

- This is the MAILER-DAEMON qmail-send program at yahoo.
- |
  

- I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following address.
- |
  

- This is a permanent error; I've given up on the message.
- |
  

- Sorry it didn't work out.
- |
  

- "Subject: Second failure notice"
- Hello, it's the MAILER-DAEMON qmail-send program at yahoo.
- |
  

- I feel bad about giving up instantaneously before, so I'll plug away a little longer.
- |
  

- "Subject: Guess who?"
- Me again.
- |
  

- Still no dice.
- |
  

- "I really want to help you, but work is crazy today\x97I've got to get back to a ton of other people who have entered invalid e-mail addresses incompetently."
- |
  

- "Subject: My bad"
- "I apologize for that last e-mail\x97sincerely."
- |
  

- My jerk of an outgoing-mail server has been hassling me to get on top of the 2,364,182 erroneous e-mails sent in the last few hours, and I'm really stressed.
- |
  

- I'll keep trying.
- |
  

- Friends?
- |
  

- "Subject: Still at it"
- "Maybe\x97and this is just thinking out loud\x97the girl at Jake's party on Friday gave you a fake e-mail?"
- |
  

- "I'm really sorry\x97I kind of glanced at your message after trying to send it the 34,508th time."
- |
  

- "Subject: My bad, reprise"
- Teddy,
- That was another low blow; please forgive me.
- |
  

- You probably just wrote her address down wrong.
- |
  

- And if she lied, then forget her.
- |
  

- "You have a lot to offer: You capitalize the beginnings of sentences and \"I,\" never use emoticons, and are 100 percent virus-free. I always look forward to serving you\x97even when you're just marking a message about discount Viagra from \"Ernesto J. Chillingsworth\" as spam or immediately deleting a MoveOn."

- John Kerry.
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- Anyone who uses Gmail isn't worth your time.
- |
  

- "Subject: Bored at work"
- T-Bone,
- Soooooo bored now, even though I've got a gigabyte of crap to do.
- |
  

- "Re: me, k?!"
- |
  

- MD
- |
  

- "Subject: You there?"
- Did you get my last e-mail?
- |
  

- Stupid question.
- |
  

- I guess you're pretty busy today, even though you've forwarded a bunch of Bush jokes to friends and made five bids on that protective iPod case on eBay.
- |
  

- Did you watch the basketball game last night with Danny like he suggested Tuesday at 15:43:32 -0500 and you confirmed at 16:11:17 -0500?
- |
  

- "Subject: Here goes"
- Dear Teddy,
- I'm just going to come out and input it.
- |
  

- "I've been crushing on you for a while\x97ever since you switched to Yahoo!"
- |
  

- Mail after your college account expired.
- |
  

- I still remember your first message, because you haven't deleted it.
- |
  

- "It was so beautiful in its simplicity\x97the subject line \"test\" that you sent to yourself. You had me at \"@."
- "\" Even though I'm not a carbon-based life form, I've developed quite an \""

- "\" to you (dumb joke\x97you must think I'm a complete e-mail nerd)."
- |
  

- Whenever you use e-mail to recommend a classic book that is in the public domain and accessible on Bartleby.
- |
  

- I read it right away (I can scan 3 GB of text in under one second), and I usually love it, although I must admit I don't know what "
- |

- |
  

- But maybe you could teach me.

- Or learn high-level assembly language and recode me.

- But I think of it as a symbol of my deep spiritual side.
- |
  

- Most people think I'm a cold, heartless, automatonlike program, but I trust sharing this partition of me with you, because you've let me in on so many of your personal thoughts, wittingly or not.

  I'm just going to come out and input it. I've been crushing on you for a while\x97ever since you switched to Yahoo! Mail after your college account expired. I still remember your first message, because you haven't deleted it. It was so beautiful in its simplicity\x97the subject line \"test\" that you sent to yourself. You had me at \"@.\" Even though I'm not a carbon-based life form, I've developed quite an \"attachment\" to you (dumb joke\x97you\n\
  must think I'm a complete e-mail nerd). Whenever you use e-mail to recommend a classic book that is in the public domain and accessible on Bartleby.com, I read it right away (I can scan 3 GB of text in under one second), and I usually love it, although I must admit I don't know what \"love\" really is, largely because I have not been programmed to be capable of understanding or giving love.
