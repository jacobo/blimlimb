- "INTERVIEWER: Oh."

- "INTERVIEWER: The Discovery Channel?"
- |
  

- Is that something in the mall?
- "STORE: Yes, they used to be called the Nature Company."

- They can get me a moon one, apparently, but they don't have any planets other than earth.

- |
  

- I'm really sorry.

- "STORE: We don't have globes of other planets, but we do have a solar system model."
- "INTERVIEWER: What's a solar system model?"
- |
  

- Is that anything like a globe?
- "STORE: A solar system model is a representation of the entire solar system."
- |
  

- You get all the planets this way.
- |
  

- There's a desktop one, with spheres mounted on Lucite dowels, and one that you can suspend from the ceiling, with string or fishing line.
- |
  

- These are really more like solar system education kits.
- |
  

- The planets aren't the size of a normal globe though.
- "INTERVIEWER: How big is it?"
- "STORE: Well, the desktop education kit fits on an average desktop."
- "INTERVIEWER: Right, but the planets, you said they're not the size of a normal globe."
- |
  

- How big are they?
- "STORE: Well, depending on the planet ."
- |
  

- Laughs.
- |
  

- We both laugh.
- |
  

- "INTERVIEWER: Yes ."
- |
  

- "STORE: Probably the largest is about the size of an average softball."
- "INTERVIEWER: I see."

- PHONECALL NO.
- |
  

- "STORE: Hammett's Learning World, this is Steve, how can we help you?"

- |
  

- I've been calling all over town, looking for globes.
- "STORE: We have globes."
- "INTERVIEWER: Are they of earth?"
- |
  

- I'm looking for globes of some of the other planets.
- |
  

- I'm interested in globes of anything other than earth.
- "STORE: No, these are just of earth."
- |
  

- We do have bulletin-board sets of the planets, but those are two-dimensional.
- |
  

- The globes we have are earth globes.
- "INTERVIEWER: Well, thank you."
- CONCLUSIONS
- |
  

- No globe of a planet other than earth is available for purchase where I live.
- |
  

- Many stores I assumed might sell globes of the planet earth do not in fact sell any globes whatsoever.
- |
  

- Based on my research, it is impossible at this juncture for me to determine with complete certainty whether the globe of Mars in the poem is based on a globe of Mars in real life or if it is instead the product of the writer's imagination.
- |
  

- If it turns out that globes of other planets do not exist, that would be a real shame.
- |
  

- I for one am not going to be the least bit surprised when I find out there aren't globes of other planets.
- |
  

- That would just be so typical.
- |
  

- The desktop solar system model at the World of Science is $27.
- |
  

- The ceiling solar system model is $27.

  In a poem called "Tulsa," in a book titled "Actual Air," by a poet
  named
  David Berman, I read, "He paints radio storms / in the basement beside
  a
  globe of Mars, / his hair and shoes the color of ox blood." This was on
  Sunday, a bright, warm, altogether atypical morning.
  Is there a company in the world today that manufactures globes of Mars?
  This
  is what I asked myself, in those exact words more or less. Is some
  factory
  somewhere pumping out globes of other planets for the people of this
  planet?
  And are those globes available locally, for purchase?
