- Dear Sirs,
- Listen, I know there's been a real negative vibe between you two lately.
- |
  

- I always see you guys on the news talking trash about the other guy, but I never see you dudes together.
- |
  

- "Man, you can't solve that kind of beef without some real heart-to-heart\x97a powwow, you know?"
- |
  

- I don't know everything there is to know about politics, but there is one thing that I do know about, and that is weed.
- So check it, this is my idea.
- |
  

- You guys need to get high together.
- |
  

- Just you two.
- |
  

- Leave Cheney and the ayatollah behind, and just smoke up!
- |
  

- Explore some different perspectives together.
- |
  

- I am certain this will mend the rift in our countries' relationship.
- I know what you're thinking.
- |
  

- You can't smoke up at Camp David or the U.N.
- |
  

- So, here's the plan.
- |
  

- I live in the basement of my mom's house.
- |
  

- East Lansing.
- |
  

- "My mom's real cool with the pot thing\x97don't worry."
- |
  

- "I've got some Cali bud that's primo\x97just came in."
- |
  

- I've got a couple of pipes, rolling papers, a massive bong, and a vaporizer.
- |
  

- Or we can do brownies, whichever suits.
- My basement is, like, the chillest place I know.
- |
  

- I've arranged the furniture in anticipation of the meeting.
- |
  

- Mr. Bush, sir, you get the futon and, Mr. Ahmadinejad, you get the beanbag chair.
- |
  

- I will be moderating from the papasan chair.
- |
  

- I've obtained black-light posters of your countries' flags that are hung above your respective chairs.
- |
  

- "It's badass\x97trust me."
- |
  

- I have also restocked the mini-fridge with brew and a range of hors d'oeuvres.
- |
  

- I don't know much about Iranian cuisine, but I imagine fish sticks and pizza rolls are pretty universal.
- Down to business.
- |
  

- Below is a brief agenda of what we might cover at the meeting.
- Nukes.
- |
  

- One thing to avoid here is thinking too much about atoms when you're high.
- |
  

- We will go way off track it we do.
- Oil.
- |
  

- Again, let's avoid thinking about fossil fuels as organic remnants of an ancient planet.
- |
  

- Dinosaurs, woolly mammoths, and the Pangaea are off-limits.
- Iraq.
- |
  

- Talking about death is the number-one buzz kill for me.
- |
  

- So let's try to steer clear of matters of death and dying in our discussion of Iraq.
- I really have a good feeling about this.
- |
  

- I have at least one kick-ass idea every time I smoke.
- |
  

- Between us three we could really hash some stuff out (pun totally intended!
- |
  

- Your bro,
- Brian
