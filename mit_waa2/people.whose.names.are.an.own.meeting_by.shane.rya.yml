- "SHERRY ANNA TAPICK: All right, everybody, let's settle down and take a seat."
- "\"PANICKY\""
- |
  

- "SARA RENTH: I'd rather stand."
- "SHERRY ANNA PATICK: That's fine, Sara."
- |
  

- She bangs a gavel.
- |
  

- As mayor of Bluff Creek, I call this meeting to order.
- |
  

- Mr. Anikaph, please proceed.
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: Tonight's first order of business is\x97"
- "PHANTASIA KRYNCER: Why is Secretary Anikaph's placard spelled wrong?"
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: For the last time, I am  not  a secretary!"
- |
  

- I'm just helping Sherry keep things in order.
- |
  

- Secratary is my first name, it's Romanian, and,  yes , it's spelled differently.
- |
  

- Can we move on, Phantasia?
- "PHANTASIA KRYNCER: Fine with me."
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: Thank you."
- |
  

- Now, the first order of business is the vandalism problem, which has only gotten worse since last month's meeting.
- |
  

- In the past week, the town's front lawns have been littered with garbage, most of it stolen from the landfill.
- CHRIS P.A.
- |
  

- "TANNYAKER: Isn't the culprit obvious?"
- |
  

- It has to be Trash-Can Rik.
- "\"TRASH-CAN\""
- |
  

- "RIK PAYNE: Excuse me?"
- |
  

- I take offense to that, Chris!
- |
  

- You're new to Bluff Creek, so maybe you didn't know, but my nickname stems from a deep commitment to proper waste disposal.
- "SHERRY ANNA TAPICK: That's true."
- |
  

- Rik's done a lot of good.
- |
  

- This hits him harder than anyone.
- CHRIS P.A.
- |
  

- "TANNYAKER: My apologies."
- |
  

- In that case, I'd look to the town drunk.
- |
  

- The vandal strikes at night, right?
- |
  

- I'd bet alcohol plays a big role.
- "\"TIPSY\""
- |
  

- "KAREN CHARNA: Go to hell, Chris!"
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: Everyone, calm down!"
- |
  

- We won't get anywhere with all this shouting!
- |
  

- I see a hand .
- |
  

- Go ahead, Seth.
- "SETH, AN ARYAN PRICK: Have you questioned all the minorities?"
- |
  

- Loud boos.
- |
  

- "SHERRY ANNA TAPICK: Seth, we've talked about this before."
- |
  

- If you're going to be racist, we'll ask you not to attend the meetings.
- "SETH, AN ARYAN PRICK: I'm just saying ."
- |
  

- "HARRY STANCAK PINE: Look, I hate to say this, but maybe Seth, in his backward way, has a point."
- |
  

- Bluff Creek is a small, insular community, and we natives have a way of being cold to outsiders.
- |
  

- Couldn't the guilty party be a disgruntled out-of-towner?
- "SIR CARY K. TANNAPHER: Surely you don't include me among the accused!"
- "HARRY STANCAK PINE: Well, no, it probably wasn't you ."
- |
  

- "SIR CARY K. TANNAPHER: A knight of the Crown has no business among trash!"
- |
  

- Further, he will not stand to be so maligned!
- "HARRY STANCAK PINE: What about the Greek guy?"
- |
  

- He's always angry.
- "PHINEAS CINTAKARRY: I have a name, you bastard!"
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: Order!"
- |
  

- Order!
- |
  

- It's unfair to accuse outsiders with no evidence, Harry.
- |
  

- And, look, maybe this is part of a bigger problem .
- |
  

- Let's face it, there's just not enough space at the landfill.
- |
  

- People are more wasteful than ever, especially the youth.
- "HENRY \"PACK RAT\" NISA: I disagree. I'm only 17, but very thrifty."
- "HENRY \"RAT PACK\" NISA: Anyone want to go watch a Dean Martin film?"
- "HENRY \"PACK RAT\" NISA: Be quiet, Dad!"
- "HENRY \"PARK ACT\" NISA: I  still  support the 1872 Yellowstone Park Act."
- "HENRY \"PACK RAT\" NISA: Grandpa, you're embarrassing me!"
- "SHERRY ANNA TAPICK: People, can we focus?"
- |
  

- Does anybody have a  valid  idea on how to stop the vandalism?
- "PERRY TANIACI KNASH: Yeah, I've got an idea."
- |
  

- I've got a great idea.
- |
  

- Let's ask Icy Pants.
- "\"ICY PANTS\""
- |
  

- "HANNAKER: If one more person calls me Icy Pants, which is based on nothing more than the fact that I have a Norwegian last name, I am going to fucking explode!"
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: Why don't you address the allegation?"
- |
  

- Where were you on the nights in question?
- "\"ICY PANTS\""
- |
  

- "HANNAKER: Gee, I don't know, maybe I was defrosting my jeans, Secratary!"
- "PHANTASIA KRYNCER: He's not a real secretary."
- "PERRY TANIACI KNASH: So you  do  have icy pants!"
- "\"ICY PANTS\""
- |
  

- "HANNAKER: I was being sarcastic!"
- "\"PANICKY\""
- |
  

- "SARA RENTH: What if it's terrorism!"
- "ATICAS PHERRYKANN: Oh, God, I see where this is going."
- "SETH, AN ARYAN PRICK: I bet you do."
- |
  

- Careful, everyone, Mr. Muslim Extremist here might be strapped with dynamite!
- "ATICAS PHERRYKANN: Seth, you have known me your entire life."
- |
  

- You see me every weekend at church, and, further, you know my last name is German.
- |
  

- "It is different\x97I repeat,  different \x97from Louis Farrakhan."
- |
  

- Who, for the record, is also not a terrorist.
- "SETH, AN ARYAN PRICK: Well, what about\x97"
- "PAT NYACKER SIRHAN: Seth, I know what you're about to say, and I'm warning you to stop."
- "SHERRY ANNA TAPICK: Enough!"
- |
  

- If nobody can be civil, I'm ready to adjourn this meeting, and the trash problem will continue unabated!
- "STEPHANIK CANARRY:  Pardonnez-moi, s'il vous pla\xEEt."
- |
  

- I may only be the town's hair stylist, but there is one man nobody has mentioned.
- |
  

- I'm speaking of the mysterious Armenian butcher.
- "\"PANICKY\""
- |
  

- "SARA RENTH: Cipher Syntarakan!"
- |
  

- The back doors burst open.
- |
  

- "CIPHER SYNTARAKAN: Did someone say my name?"
- |
  

- General gasps.
- |
  

- "CIPHER SYNTARAKAN: That's right, citizens of Bluff Creek."
- |
  

- It was me!
- |
  

- I dumped trash on everyone's lawn!
- |
  

- And I'm talking  everyone!
- |
  

- I'm talking Ayn Tanrick Parish, the girl named after Ayn Rand.
- |
  

- I'm talking Yanshir Trespancek, the Bosnian refugee!
- |
  

- I'm talking Terin "Ash Can" Pyrak, the chain smoker! I'm talking "Prankster" Cay Hain and his lesser-known sidekick, "Prankish" Arny Cept, who finally got a taste of their own medicine!
- |
  

- I'm talking H.N.
- |
  

- "\"Paris Racket\""
- |
  

- Nya, the man who runs the French black market.
- |
  

- "I'm talking \"Aspen\" Ricky Hartan, the arrogant rich guy who skis a lot! I'm talking NN Party-ac, i.e., Shark\x97I'm not real sure what his deal is, except that he creeps me out pretty bad. I'm talking\x97"
- "SECRATARY ANIKAPH: Enough!"
- |
  

- Someone subdue that man!
- |
  

- Cipher Syntarakan throws smoke capsules to the ground.
- |
  

- When the smoke clears, he has escaped.
- |
  

- Only a note remains, pinned to the door.
- |
  

- It reads, "I escpr!
- |
  

- Ran!
- |
  

- Thnk ya!
