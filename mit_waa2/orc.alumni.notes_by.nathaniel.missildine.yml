- Soon after, I found myself working with genius Richard Serra, transporting and installing his gorgeously ominous hunks of sheet metal into previously wide-open spaces throughout the Northeast.
- |
  

- He calls me indispensable, and I haven't been this satisfied since I helped build the Black Tower back in the day.
- |
  

- If some of you aren't familiar with Mr. Serra, you really should check out his work.
- |
  

- Though he denies it, he is almost certainly part Orc.

- Plus, his work actually kills people.

- I work out 12 times a week.
- |
  

- On top of lifting, I also run.

- |
  

- "But it's not such a big deal\x97I was bred for power and speed in the daylight."
- |
  

- I'm looking forward this fall to adding more rep sets to my lat pulls.

- CLASS OF '81
- I am president of the World Bank, elected this summer after my stint with the Project for the New American Century.

- Shagrat, Orc Chieftain
- CLASS OF '88
- I guess a lot has changed, but I still feel like the same maniacal supermutant.
- |
  

- I'm getting by all right, with a wife and kids and a stable job as an elevator mechanic in Toledo, Ohio.
- |
  

- Still, sometimes it all just feels a little strange.
- |
  

- I mean, we all knew the days of terrorizing villagers and launching their body parts from catapults was not going to last, but why then did it all seem so fraught with deeper meaning?
- |
  

- It was as though those moments revealed a truth about the world and ourselves that we then didn't realize would be so hard to ever find again.
- |
  

- I've arrived, as they say, but why do I put all my energy into explaining to the wife why I loaded the dishwasher wrong or trying to get in the fastest lane of traffic or trying not to feast on the entrails of the person standing in front of me in the line at the post office.
- |
  

- In the end, I suppose I just miss the old togetherness.
- |
  

- The world can be a cruel and vicious place compared to the hell-pits of Mordor.
- |
  

- I honestly don't get how the humans do it.
