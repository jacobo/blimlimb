- Day 15 &#151; Throw out hardly-touched pat&eacute; and cheese.
- Day 16 &#151; Mutter words "Jesus Christ" upon finding very few socks in dresser. Become annoyed, then intrigued, by steady loss of socks, as though your dresser has a slow, persistent leak.

- Day 18 &#151; Assume left-wing attitude after seeing young man zooming around a child-filled neighborhood in a German sports car.
- |
  

- Return to garden analogy, thinking that the world's trees are too tall, their nourishing fruit out of ordinary reach, and that greedy opportunists have humped their way up the trunk of each tree, sitting contentedly in the foliated tops, gorging on lychee and mango while throwing hard coconuts onto the heads of the rightfully confused, innocent, and gently weak underclass.
- Day 19 &#151; Have steak for dinner.
- |
  

- Become put off by policy wonks featured on televised political discussion show.
- |

- |
  

- Place shoes into empty green garbage bag.
- |
  

- While doing so, reflect on the solitary, abandoned shoes that litter highway medians and river banks.
- |
  

- Wonder about the original wearers and where the other shoe is.
- |
  

- Realize it's because of moments like these that mother says you are a dreamer (and not in the visionary, you-could-be-the-next-Bill-Gates sense of the term).
- Day 21 &#151;  Have fond memories of high-school friend triggered by gum ad on bus.
- |
  

- Resolve to phone friend long-distance later that night, but get absorbed in a TV show and forget.
- Day 22 &#151; Remember that you forgot to phone high-school friend last night, and resolve to do it tonight.
- |
  

- But forget.
- Day 23 &#151; Throw out olives (totally untouched).
