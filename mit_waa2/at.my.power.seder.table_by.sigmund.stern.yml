- Mendy's Kosher Mart was out of Mogen David.
- "MADONNA: Dear, the children have prepared the questions for you."
- "ROCCO: Ahem: Father, we have some notes, and we look forward to your feedback."
- "LOURDES: Why is it that on this night we eat matzo, though on all other nights we eat either sushi or just plain water?"
- "GUY: The matzo is to remind us of when we were wandering in the desert and the only food left in the van was carbs."
- "MADONNA: Our bosom grew large while our hair grew long, but it wasn't worth it."
- "LINDSAY: Why on this night do we drink not one but fourteen cups of wine?"
- "LOURDES: Papa, will you tell us the story of the exodus?"
- "GUY: My father was a fugitive Aramean ."
- |
  

- "MADONNA: Let's not get into why he was a fugitive."
- |
  

- The point is, we were lured into Egypt with great promises.
- "GUY: \"You will be supported\"; \"You will get points\": These were the promises with which they promised us things."

- But when we arrived the Egyptians worked us with hard work.
- "LINDSAY: Hey, I asked a fucking question here!"
- "MADONNA: The Egyptians treated us cruelly."
- "GUY: They criticized our dialogue-writing with criticism."
- "MADONNA: The urchins in the street did not know who we were, and when we asked them to help us flee to a Four Seasons, they threw stones."
- "GUY: So the Lord sent down an agent called Moses\x97"
- "LOURDES: Which one?"
- "GUY: And Moses said, \"Let my people go."
- "MADONNA: The Pharaoh replied, \"My people will talk with your people."
- "\" So we waited."
- |
  

- We petitioned again, but he would not respond to our petitions.
- "JAY-Z: At best, we would get through to the Pharaoh's page."
- "MADONNA: That Cushite flake."
- |
  

- "So, finally\x97"
- "GUY: Blood, fire, and pillars of smoke!"
- "MADONNA: Thank you, Guy."
- |
  

- The Lord brought the plagues upon Egypt.
- "GUY: Are we up to the plagues now?"
- "JAY-Z: Then God brought lice upon the people."
- "GUY: Though some rabbis say it was just Gabriel, the backup dancer."
- "MADONNA: Finally, the Lord came and dealt with everyone's pilots: their firstborn, if you will."
- "GUY: To stand out from the Egyptians, I had a revelation to use real sheep's blood in our paint."
- |
  

- Crazy, I know, but, at the same time, it worked.
- "MADONNA: When the agents saw the blood, they got excited and passed over everyone else's projects."
- "JAY-Z: And the Lord said, \"I shall lead you into Israel, where you will be crossover sensations."
- "GUY: And that  Revolver  had been unfairly panned."
- "ALL: Amen."
- "MADONNA: Lourdes darling, come to the door so we may greet Elijah."
- |
  

- Bono sighs.
- |
  

- "ME: What's the matter, Uncle Bono?"
- "BONO: I wish that everyone in the world could afford to have Elijah Wood flown in for the holidays."
- "JAY-Z: Bono, will you lead the singing?"
- |
  

- I'll just talk over you if that's OK.
- "BONO: Very well."
- |
  

- "This is not a protest song: this is \"One Kid for Two Zuzim."
- "ALL: Jerusalem in '09!"
