- AN INTERVIEW
- WITH GEOFF FOX,
- METEOROLOGIST.
- |
  

- BY  SUZANNE YEAGLEY
- |
  

- "Q: How did you become a weatherman?"
- "A: I was in Buffalo and trying not to work outside."
- |
  

- I was hosting  PM Magazine , which was totally in the field.
- I remember it was the day before we broke for Christmas and we were at the Niagara Falls Air Force Base.
- |
  

- It was really cold, and really windy, and we were out on the tarmac, and my lips were no longer working.
- |
  

- It was one of those situations where you had to cup your hands to your lips and blow, just to warm your lips to be able to speak.
- |
  

- I was thinking, "This TV thing is good, but I'm not sure about the way I'm getting into it.
- "Q: Did you go to school to learn meteorology?"
- "A: I didn't study it."
- |
  

- While I was doing  PM Magazine , they had a weekend person on who was just horrendous.
- |
  

- She mispronounced the names of towns .
- |
  

- So I asked if I could do it and they said, "Go ahead.
- "Q: They just gave you the job?"
- "A: Yep."
- |
  

- But right away I started to study, and almost immediately I realized it was fun.
- |
  

- It's like a new puzzle every day.
- |
  

- The pieces you get today help you solve the puzzle for tomorrow.
- Weather reporting has really changed over the last 20 years.
- |
  

- It used to be putting magnetic suns on magnetic boards.
- |
  

- There was less scientific efficacy, less knowledge.
- I was one of the last people to get in before things started to change.
- "Q: Do you enjoy it?"
- "A: Quite frankly, being on TV is like crack cocaine for middle-aged guys like me."
- I grew up wanting to be on radio and to be a celebrity.
- |
  

- "A lot of people are weather weenies\x97really into climatology."
- |
  

- But I started out on radio.
- When I started I was in my mid-30s and now I'm in my mid-50s.
- |
  

- This job has afforded me the things I thought it would.
- |
  

- It doesn't come at once, though, which is nice.
- |
  

- You work into it; it doesn't happen all of a sudden.
- "I'm more able to understand\x97the nice way people treat me\x97now there's an obligation to give back."
- |
  

- People in Connecticut have afforded me a very nice life.
- |
  

- And I do a lot of charity work.
- And I also work around all of these incredibly good-looking babes.
- |
  

- A little less so for the guys.
- Oh, man, I'm really going to come off looking like a smart-ass.
- "Q: It's OK, you're making me laugh."
- |
  

- So people treat you well?
- "A: At restaurants, the dry cleaners, the gas station."
- |
  

- They are nice to me because they know who I am, and you get to start off in a good way.
- |
  

- I try to be as gracious as humanly possible.
- "Q: What did you study in college?"
- "A: Ummm ."
- |
  

- I was on the accelerated dismissal program.
- |
  

- But I just finished three years of schooling to get my meteorology degree.
- |
  

- "It's different when you're grown up\x97instead of being something you have to do, it's something you do to make yourself a better person."
- "Q: Do you have any advice for people who want to go into this industry?"
- "A: Don't go after my job."
- |
  

- The world doesn't need any smarter, younger, more talented people who are willing to work for less money.
- "Q: Are there a lot of people with meteorology degrees trying to get jobs?"
- "A: Unfortunately, there are many more meteorologists than good jobs."
- |
  

- There are a limited amount of jobs on TV.
- And there are less and less in the government and the private sector, like with AccuWeather or other weather vendors that I buy things from.
- Also, by the way, I want to tell you something.
- |
  

- Stop watching the Weather Channel.
- |
  

- I believe it causes cancer.
- |
  

- I don't want people to get sick.
- "Q: You are quite the humanitarian."
- "A: Well, thank you."
- |
  

- I don't need people taking the caviar out of my daughter's mouth, so .
- |
  

- "Q: How do you figure out the forecast each night?"
- "A: I talk to the Psychic Friends Network."
- |
  

- Actually, it's all very scientific.
- |
  

- There are a variety of computer models.
- |
  

- Some are run by the government, and everyone, including you, can access them for free.
- |
  

- Then some are proprietary, like we have here at the station.
- |
  

- Then there are universities that do research projects, like they have a great tropical forecast model at Florida State.
- They all leave you with numbers.
- |
  

- It's my job to put it in perspective.
- |
  

- It's not as important to be right with all the minutiae; what's important is for you to have a sense of what it will be like.
- |
  

- I translate the technical jargon into something that's meaningful.
- |
  

- If I do it well, you'll be nice when you see me.
- If Miss Cleo had better feedback, I'd throw out the computers and move in with Miss Cleo.
- |
  

- I don't use science because it's the proper thing, I use it because it works best.
- |
  

- If woolly caterpillars worked, I'd use them.
- "Q: Can you tell me how the green screen works?"
- "A: Did you see  The African Queen ?"
- "Q: No, I didn't."
- "A: Oh, you gotta see it."
- |
  

- It takes place during the early Nazi era in central Africa.
- |
  

- In one scene, Bogie and Hepburn are in the rapids.
- |
  

- And back then, they never thought you'd have a VCR where you could stop and look at the movie, frame by frame.
- |
  

- But if you did, and you could, you'd see that the background is all ratty.
- |
  

- "This was one of the first green screens\x97an optical creation of Hollywood."
- We do it electronically, so I can't wear green, thank God.
- |
  

- Anything that's the color of the screen disappears.
- You could use any color.
- |
  

- I know they use blue; I'm sure you could use others.
- "Q: So do you get to choose the maps you're going to use each night?"
- "A: I'm self-produced."
- |
  

- I'm like the football kicker.
- |
  

- I'm the short guy who they bring in to do something completely different from the rest of the team.
- |
  

- My sole job is to kick the ball without a penalty.
- |
  

- I don't read from scripts .
- |
  

- "Q: Really?"
- |
  

- You never read from a teleprompter?
- "A: I never have\x97I never did."
- |
  

- I decide what's important.
- |
  

- My boss might tell me what he likes or dislikes, but I get to do my own thing.
- "Q: When do you go on the air?"
- "A: We're on at 5, 5:30, 6, 10, and 11."
- |
  

- I come in at 3, leave at 11:35.
- |
  

- Except on Monday nights, when I have to stay until after football.
- "Q: That's a lot of hours."
- "A: It's like a real full-time job!"
- Actually, I think my wife kind of likes the schedule.
- |
  

- I don't go to bed until 4, 4:30 in the morning, and I've developed as a bit of a snorer, so I think she's grateful.
- "Q: Have you won any awards?"
- "A: I've won seven Emmy Awards."
- "Q: What were they for?"
- "A: Best futon."
- |
  

- No, I don't know, for weather, hosting, feature story.
- |
  

- "They are regional Emmys\x97they have a rectangular bottom instead of a circular bottom, but you can trade in six regional for one national."
- |
  

- No, I'm just kidding.
- "Q: Have you had any embarrassing moments doing this job?"
- "A: Ummm ."
- |
  

- Like 20 years ago I got an envelope in the mail.
- |
  

- It had two tickets to a football game, and I was like, "OK, someone gave me football tickets.
- "\" Then I realized they were from the week before."
- |
  

- Then I read the letter and it said, "
- You said it was going to be so awful, so we didn't go, but I could've gotten tan lines it was so sunny.
- "\" They sent one letter to me and one to Al Roker, who was working on channel 4 in New York at the time."
- There was another time, just about as long ago, when I was reporting on a blizzard.
- |
  

- Every hour I would say, "It should be ending in the next hour or two," but I did that all night, through about 10 more inches of snow. It took at least a year for them to forgive me for that.
