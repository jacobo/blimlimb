- "The Threat:  Terrorism"
- If there is a terrorist attack on or near Election Day, it is important to remember that terrorists hate democracy, not republicancy.
- |
  

- Even terrorists know that is not a real word.
- |
  

- So if you are a Democrat, do not appear in public on Election Day.
- |
  

- The terrorists will be able to identify you as a Democrat by your fashionable casual clothing, your look of concern when you see litter or starving children, and your hatred of America.
- |
  

- If you do go out in public, you can throw the terrorists off your scent by going into a voting booth and voting Republican, then loudly proclaiming to anyone who will hear, "I voted Republican, by God!
- |
  

- I love that Iraq war!
- |
  

- Good times!
- |
  

- Ick, who put this starving child in my Range Rover?
- |
  

- Why, I oughta .
- |
  

- "The Threat:  Bees"
- If there is a group that hates democracy more than terrorists, it has to be the bees.
- |
  

- Bees live in a monarchy, where a female aristocrat dictates every aspect of each bee's existence.
- |
  

- If the bees try to attack on Election Day, be aware that bees are very likely to go for Democrats first, because Democrats smell sweetly of patchouli and sweaty, non-missionary-position sex, sometimes with people of the same gender, if you can believe such a thing.
- |
  

- Democrats are always doing it in weird positions such as "Woman on Top," "The Buffalo," and "The Mad Max." These activities not only create STDs; they also attract bees.
- |
  

- Stay home, Democrats.
- |
  

- Stay home and enjoy your "Choo-Choo Train," or bees will attack and kill you. Bees!
- "The Threat:  The Current Administration"
- Let's face it.
- |
  

- No one hates the electoral process more than the current administration.
- |
  

- I don't know if you know this, but they could actually be voted out of office on election day.
- |
  

- And that just isn't fair.
- |
  

- Let's say someone wanted to fire you from your sweet job at that nonprofit food bank, where you work just because you sent some of your employees out on an ill-conceived Meals on Wheels mission and a bunch of them died.
- |
  

- If we held an election today to see if you should be fired, wouldn't  you  assemble an army of superintelligent bees to attack your enemies?
- |
  

- Isn't America all about having the freedom to hypnotize striped insects to do your bidding?
- |
  

- Go, little bees.
- |
  

- Fly, bees!
- |
  

- My bees!
- |
  

- My bees!
