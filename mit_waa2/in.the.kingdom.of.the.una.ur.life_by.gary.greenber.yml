  The first time I got a letter from the Unabomber, I had my wife open it.
  I was at work, the letter had come to my house, and neither of us wanted
  to wait to see what Ted Kaczynski, whose outgoing mail was by then

  a #10 envelope, the letter was addressed in the careful block capitals
  that the post office says will guarantee maximum efficiency. He even put
  his return address, in the same frank print, in just the right spot. No
  fool, Kaczynski knows that the mails will only work for you if you work
  with them.
  The first letter, which arrived in mid-June of last year, had not come
  unbidden. Six months earlier, just after he'd pleaded guilty to the
  Unabom crimes, I'd written Kaczynski a letter. Although I had paid close
  attention to his case for nearly three years, from his emergence as a
  composite sketch demanding space for his manuscript in a national
  publication to his arrest, incarceration, and abortive trial, my letter
  wasn't fan mail. Instead, it was a pitch.
  Here's how it began:
  January 24, 1998
  Dear Mr. Kaczynski:
  Please forgive my intrusion into your life. I am not sure if this letter
  will gain a sympathetic reading, or any reading for that matter. But
  after thinking long and hard about writing it, I'm taking the chance.
  I would like you to consider allowing me to write a biography of you. I
  am sure you have had many requests from other people to do this, and for
  all I know you are already working with someone. Or, for that matter,
  you may be opposed in principle to the very idea. In the event, however,
  that neither of these are the case, I hope you'll read on and think
  about my request.
  When he read on, Kaczynski found out that I thought I was suited for the
  job for many reasons. I explained that I was a psychologist with a
  research interest in the misuses of psychiatry, of which I believed his
  recent diagnosis as a paranoid schizophrenic (and his ensuing mass-media
  portrayal as a lunatic) was a perfect case. I told him that I was well
  acquainted with the tradition of antimodern, antitechnology protest, and
  that I believed his life story fit squarely within that tradition. And I
  ended by saying that all of this coupled with the fact that I had lived
  off the grid in a cabin in the woods for a number if years meant that I
  could give him as sympathetic a treatment as he was likely to get. I
  invited him to write me back if he was interested, and then I waited.
  My prospective subject was sufficiently intrigued to ask, through his
  lawyer, for more information about me. So, during the spring, I wrote
  Kaczynski a short autobiography. I told him about my therapy practice
  and my teaching, even a little about my personal life, and I sent him
  some of my academic writings&nbsp;-- two articles and a book. I heard nothing
  directly, and in mid-May, 1998, after he'd been sent to the Supermax
  prison in Florence, Colorado, I sent him a gentle reminder of my
  existence. His first letter came in response.
  Kaczynski couldn't know that he had written this letter on my 41st
  birthday, but despite myself, I allowed the coincidence to take on some
  meaning. Midlife had left me wondering about my professional craft,
  hard-pressed to fulfill therapy's promised miracle&nbsp;-- not the offer of
  quick cures for psychic suffering, but the extension of a hope as
  American as Plymouth Rock: that with honest hard work, some weeping here
  and some soul-searching there, anyone can pursue and find happiness. The
  miracle embedded in this promise is that it keeps alive the possibility
  of a good life amid the execrable social order that Ted Kaczynski wanted
  to destroy.
  The first letter itself wasn't much: a four-page, single-spaced
  document, handwritten with pencil. There were no signs of erasures or
  corrections. The prose didn't so much flow as march steadily from the
  beginning of an idea to its end, with nary a false logical step in the
  parade. Above all else, the letter conveyed a calm rationality, a sharp
  intellect, and a distinct courtliness. Kaczynski had detected my
  impatience to hear from him and explained, without complaint or

  going to write an autobiography, but he allowed that a book by someone
  else would still be a worthwhile addition to the knowledge about him. He
  seemed accustomed to thinking of himself as a historic figure.
  And then he asked me a question, based on the articles I had sent him:
  Did I really believe, he wondered, that there was no such thing as
  objective truth? After all, he said, a nuclear bomb's effects are
  predictable and deadly regardless of the culture in whose midst it
  explodes. He wanted to know how my relativism, which he'd detected in my
