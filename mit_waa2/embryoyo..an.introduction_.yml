  You're not going to like this,
  says the mechanic. Fine.
  I already don't like people sending me
  pictures of their children not because
  I don't appreciate wee Marta eating paint chips
  or Alexander thrashing his horsie
  but how does one dispose of such photos
  without weird mojo?
  And I don't like that everyone gets a frog
  to vivisect when a simulation
  accomplishes just as much, frogs,
  their plight, being a priority of mine.
  Compared to bleaching the planet,
  what's an alternator?
  60% believe man's created in God's image
  but can't see His face in the mantis,
  His heart in the dying squirrel.
  The gun lobby got the vote out.
  Comparatively, what's a problem with the wiring?
  110% said the data was tabulated fairly.
  Please don't let me become
  one of those who won't touch anything
  without gloves because of the contagion
  although I feel the attraction.
  Don't like paper or plastic.
  Don't like people leaving their dogs in hot cars,
  don't like the football traffic
  or the new parlance of emailing courtiers.
  Cram as many notes as you want
  into Twinkle Twinkle Little Star,
  it's still Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
  Christmas lights left up all year
  thus robbed of the emotive force
  of their redeployment I do not like.
  Can you give me a new soul,
  asked a guy on Telegraph Avenue.
  Yeah, right, another nutcase
  but then he started to cry.
  Big sober kid in expensive thug regalia.
  What happened to your first one?
  Defiled.
  Him, I liked.
