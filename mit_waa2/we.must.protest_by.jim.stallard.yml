  Tang Jiaxuan 
  Foreign Minister 
  The People's Republic of China
  Dear Mr. Tang,
  On behalf of the United States Government, I want to express my 
  gratitude for allowing our inspection of the EP-3 Navy patrol 
  aircraft that was forced to make an emergency landing on the island 
  of Hainan. It is our deepest hope that our two nations will not allow 
  this unfortunate incident to interfere with the important economic 
  relations that hold such promise for a prosperous future.
  However, I must take exception to certain actions of Chinese 
  personnel who boarded the EP-3&#151;which our government considers to 
  be sovereign territory&#151;while the aircraft was in your 
  possession. Close examination of the aircraft has revealed clear 
  violations of the equipment and confidential data within the 
  aircraft, which is protected by international law. Some of it appears 
  to fall into the category of outright sabotage.
  Among the violations discovered so far:
  
   
  
   The musical compact disc (CD) collection under the workstation of 
  Senior Airman Curtis Towne had clearly been disturbed. There are 
  several pieces of evidence bearing this out:
  The CDs by Metallica ("Load") and Bad Company ("Running With the 
  Pack") were not placed in their respective cases but left unprotected 
  on top of Lt. Towne's monitor.
  Jethro Tull's "Aqualung" had been incorrectly filed in 
  the section delineated for singer/songwriters.
  Two CDs by the Woo Tan Klan ("Wu-Tang Forever" and "Enter 
  the Wu-Tang") are missing.
  Computer records show that the half-finished novel on Lt. 
  Tierney's hard drive had been opened and examined. Regarding the 
  unsolicited comments inserted at the end of the document: It is not 
  your nation's prerogative to judge whether a creative 
  work-in-progress is "overly derivative."
  A personal photograph of Lt. John Comerford's wife was 
  defaced with graffiti making a crude reference to U.S. scientist Wen 
  Ho Lee's "having been" to a site on the photograph. Mrs. Comerford's 
  current grave illness makes this act especially outrageous.
  The messages in the fortune cookies left on Lt. Robert 
  Harper's seat are not appreciated. I won't go any further on that 
  subject except to point out that Mannix is a fictional television 
  character, not a real person.
  More than 16 minutes of audiotape containing 
  irreplaceable surveillance data was recorded over with what seemsto 
  be several persons making oral sounds that resemble machine guns, 
  exploding bombs and human flatulence. Analysis of the sounds (and 
  accompanying snickering) allowed U.S. linguists to establish that the 
  persons on the audiotape were raised somewhere in the province of 
  Hunan in your nation.
  Electronic analysis by U.S. military technicians revealed 
  that three VHS videotapes aboard the EP-3 plane ("Red Dawn"; 
  "ET&#151;The Extra-Terrestrial"; and "The Thin Red Line") were 
  duplicated while the Chinese government had control of the aircraft. 
  This is a flagrant violation of international copyright laws.
  Two bathroom commodes were apparently used and not flushed.
  The seat of Lt. Patrick Honeck in the cockpit had been 
  adjusted to accommodate a much smaller person and not returned to its 
  original position.
  I don't feel the need to remind you that the United States is not 
  a collection of drunk, unarmed students celebrating in the middle of 
  a public square. In addition to its formidable military strength, the 
  U.S. exports a staggering amount of filmed entertainment, popular 
  music, computer technology and tobacco. In the future, violations 
  like the ones listed above will be met with swift, merciless tariffs.
  For a nation thought to be 4,000 years old, it is unfortunate that 
  yours feels the need to act like one so immature. On behalf of the 
  U.S., let me say we are truly  shenbiao qianyi  this is the case.
  Sincerely,
  Joseph W. Prueher 
  United States Ambassador to China
