- Hey, bud!
- |
  

- What're the tears for?
- |
  

- Sometimes the inside bread wrapper is a little ripped open.
- |
  

- No big deal.
- |
  

- I'm sure it happened in transit.
- |
  

- Do you know how far that bread had to travel to make it to your toaster, bro?
- |
  

- Jostling happens, dude.
- |
  

- Give it a squeeze.
- |
  

- Pretty soft, huh?
- |
  

- Am I right?
- |
  

- That feels pretty fresh, bro.
- |
  

- Now grab a couple awesome slices and toast away!
- |
  

- You're in for a treat!
- |
  

- So, you didn't get a seat on the subway.
- |
  

- There's no reason to cry, little dude!
- |
  

- Look around!
- |
  

- You see all those beautiful people standing?
- |
  

- You're one of them!
- |
  

- Look how tall you seem next to those seated around you!
- |
  

- Why don't you tuck your blanket into your bag now, OK?
- |
  

- It's OK to have a security blanket, but let's pull it out only when we  really  need it, all right?
- |
  

- There you go, bud!
- |
  

- Just think, the next time you get a seat on the subway, it's gonna be  awesome !
- |
  

- You can't cut in line at Starbucks, chief, or you get yelled at.
- |
  

- We've been over this.
- |
  

- Take a deep breath, brocephus.
- |
  

- That's it, just calm down for a sec.
- |
  

- Wipe your eyes and reassess.
- |
  

- OK, look around.
- |
  

- Here you are at the back of the line, feeling a little humiliated.
- |
  

- How many people do you count in front of you?
- |
  

- Fifteen?
- |
  

- Twenty?
- |
  

- People like Starbucks, bro.
- |
  

- Fact of life.
- |
  

- And all these people deserve it just as much as you do.
- |
  

- So you can't walk in and expect to go to the head of the line just because you're in a great mood after beating an elderly Asian woman to a seat on the subway.
- |
  

- Be patient, bro.
- |
  

- Count bald dudes or something.
- |
  

- You'll have your pipin'-hot joe in no time.
- |
  

- Jennings is not the devil.
- |
  

- He just works in accounting.
- |
  

- His lazy eye  is  scary, but Jennings is not the devil.
- |
  

- He just works in accounting.
- |
  

- His lazy eye  is  scary, but Jennings is not the devil.
- |
  

- He just works in accounting.
- |
  

- His lazy eye  is  scary, yes.
- |
  

- That's  your  phone ringing, brodski.
- |
  

- Yup.
- |
  

- Phones ring, man, that's what they do.
- |
  

- What comes next?
- |
  

- You got it, bro!
- |
  

- That's right, gotta pick it up.
- |
  

- And what do we say when we put the receiver to our ear?
- |
  

- Right!
- |
  

- Nice work.
- |
  

- Now go for it, bro.
- |
  

- So what if it's Boss?
- |
  

- It might not be.
- |
  

- What if it's those cool Morning Zoo DJs and you've won a prize?
- |
  

- You never know, bro!
- |
  

- I'd say it's worth the gamble, huh?
- |
  

- It's not ringing anymore, is it?
- |
  

- All right, bud.
- |
  

- Next time it rings, don't look at this card, just pick it up.
- |
  

- She say no again, broheim?
- |
  

- "All right, all right, quit your whimpering and let's break this down: Leslie's married, right?"
- |
  

- And you ask her out to Houlihan's for happy hour, every single day, right?
- |
  

- Time to strategize, bro-bro.
- |
  

- First off, no matter who it is, the likelihood of them saying yes when you sneak up behind them at the copier is very slim.
- |
  

- And lose the erection, OK, bud?
- |
  

- You're getting a little ahead of yourself.
- |
  

- What say we go back to our desk and have a peanut-butter cup?
- |
  

- Hm?
- |
  

- There's always tomorrow, dude!
- |
  

- I know it's crowded in here, little man.
- |
  

- It's happy hour!
- |
  

- So lose that sob face and get  happy , broheim.
- |
  

- Order yourself up a Budweiser Select and get to maxin' and relaxin', coach.
- |
  

- Squeaky wheel gets the grease, chief, so hustle up to the bar and get noticed.
- |
  

- Once you have an ice-cold Bud Select in your mitts, you can chill like you're ill!
- |
  

- Couldn't do it, could you, bro?
- |
  

- YOU CAN'T SMACK THE BARTENDER AND EXPECT A DRINK, BRO.
- |
  

- Oh, bro.
- |
  

- I feel for you.
- |
  

- Let's cut our losses and get on the subway, what do you say?
- |
  

- "Yeah, you can pull your blanket out\x97why not?"
- |
  

- It's OK to wear just a T-shirt to bed, manbo.
- |
  

- It's your bed; you can sleep in it how you want.
- |
  

- Why you crying again, bud?
- |
  

- I know it's been a long, hard day, coz.
- |
  

- But guess what?
- |
  

- Tomorrow is a new one, and your trusty index cards will be right here to help you out.
- |
  

- We'll never leave your side, bro!
- |
  

- So put your head down on the pillow, close those eyes, and get dreamin'!
- |
  

- It's OK to leave the light on.
- |
