- On Friday, the first night after Thanksgiving, the annual epidemic of wheezing infants and vomiting, gastrointestinally-afflicted children failed to materialize.
- |
  

- Instead, at 7 PM, shortly after my shift began, a greenish 15-year-old was wheeled into the crowded Pediatric waiting room and puked, sending toddlers and already disgruntled parents flying.
- |
  

- The treatment area was already packed and no one would be getting in to be seen for at least another half-hour.
- |
  

- I had gone to the waiting room to scope out sick kids to get their evaluation started, but went straight to this newest arrival.
- |
  

- The nurse wheeling him in had completed a triage sheet, showing a lowish blood pressure and fastish heart rate.
- "\"Hey folks,\""
- |
  

- I announced, "I'm the doctor tonight, and I hate to make you all wait even longer, but this guy needs to come right back.
- |
  

- I'm sorry, and I'll try to get to you all as soon as I can, but this guy's gotta go next.
- To his parents, as we wheeled into the treatment area, I said, "He'd better have appendicitis or something worse, because I just put myself on the line with all the folks out there.
- |
  

- And all the nurses in here.
- "\" The kid himself obliged."
- |
  

- "\"Dude,\""
- |
  

- "\"I'm&#151;\""
- |
  

- The Pediatric section has 11 beds in an ER that can hold another 40-some patients, plus a dozen or so more unofficial slots along the hallways when needed.
- |
  

- Like the roads and shopping malls that day, every square inch was occupied.
- |
  

- Very few patients were actually emergency sick.
- |
  

- The adult patients, like the children in my charge, were mainly present for the reassurance of a blood test or radiologic picture, and the balm of a bottle of antibiotics.
- |
  

- We were not quite at overload, but our patient population has a tendency to panic at any symptom, and I couldn't help but feel that we shouldn't be so close to that point, either.
- |
  

- The first batch of kids, from 7 to 11 PM clustered in the 2&#150;4-year-old range, with an equal mix of earaches, vomiting, and fever.
- |
  

- The exception was a hulky 15-year-old who had collided head on with another 15-year-old at football practice and left a dent in the school turf.
- |
  

- He sat in his stretcher, half-leering at our blonde tech showing off her low-back tattoo, with his dad glowering.
- |
  

- When the dad, a solid special-ops looking kind of guy, caught my eye, he planted himself straight in my path.
- "\"When are you gonna scan my son?"
- "I hadn't even been in to examine him, but several things were immediately clear:    The dad had no interest whatsoever in my clinical judgment regarding his son."
- |
  

- The son had no risk whatsoever of anything more serious than a minor head bonk.
- |
  

- They had insurance.
- |
  

- There were more important things for me to do than fight this  I was gonna get the CAT scan they wanted.
- I sized up the dad again and told him, "Already in the works, chief.
- |
  

- AM saw an all-ages mix with a hint of croupy 3-year-olds and all my CAT scan reports came back.
- |
  

- The greenish 15-year-old turned out to have appendicitis, the hulky football player had, as the radiologist called it, a "negative brain.
- Football-kid went to the same school as appendicitis-kid, and told him, "You look pretty wrong.
- "\" Appendicitis-kid-dad told football-kid-dad, \""
- That doc got me back here right away.
- "\" Football-kid-dad told appendicitis-kid-dad, \""
- That doc wasted my whole fucking night.
- "\" Appendicitis-kid told football-kid he'd been watching  8 Mile  when he got sick."
