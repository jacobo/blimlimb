  EPISODE ONE: THE DAWNING
  When asked to define the essence of his "it" factor, Scott
  Moffatt, oldest and it-iest member of Canadian supergroup
  the Moffatts, replied with a knowingness that belied his 16
  years.
  "I think," the man-child recently said, "chicks dig the
  guitar."

  May 19, 2000
  Lately, I've been thinking a lot about Scott's meditation on
  celebrity and how his particular pheromone for fame (mixed
  around with those of this triplet brothers/bandmates)
  informs the hegemony which boy bands, in general, represent.
  As the official unauthorized biographer of another, earlier
  subculture, the Backstreet Boys, it is impossible not to
  recognize the dominance of this ascending power as causing
  the spectacular breakdown of consensus in the burgeoning era
  of Total Request Live.
  Well, at least that's what I like to tell myself.
  Subjecting bands like the Moffatts or the Backstreet Boys to
  the structuralist, semiotic, and analytical techniques
  propagated by Karl Marx and Roland Barthes is something I
  have to do because of what I do: I write books about
  flavor-of-the-month celebrities. And I write them for
  screaming, 12-year-old girls.
  I puff myself up for two reasons. First off,.there's
  nothing inherently validating in writing about the cast of
  characters -- the Justin Timberlakes, the Nick Carters, the
  Christina Aguileras -- that populate the inside of a
  teenager's locker. Secondly, I self-elevate because no
  one else will. Except for possibly Neil Postman, and as far as
  I know, he has not written a letter of admiration in care of
  my publisher.
  "You're writing a book about who?" asks my writer-friend
  Karl, whose books usually concern themselves with callboys,
  heroin, bare-knuckle fighting, wastelands, and Detroit.
  Sometimes all at once.
  "Tell me you didn't just say LeAnn Rimes," he responds when
  I indeed tell him I am writing a book about LeAnn Rimes.
  "You are not writing a book about LeAnn Rimes," he says while shaking
  his head to illustrate how dumbfounded, how completely taken
  aback he is.
  I have disappointed him. More so when I tell him, a year
  later, that I am now writing a book about the Backstreet
  Boys. "I did not. Just hear you say that," he will go.
  I lack the guts to tell him that this year, rounding out the
  Galaxy of Superstars trilogy, will be my opus on Ricky
  Martin.
  Like actually going out and purchasing (and probably
  wearing) a pristine, yet clearly vintage, Journey concert
  tour jacket, writing about teen pin-ups is perfectly okay as
  long as it's done with the bathos it deserves. But otherwise, it is not
  perfectly okay.
  "At fifteen, LeAnn Rimes has accomplished things most adults
  can never hope to. She looks forward to the future and
  dreams of all the things she still wants to achieve.
  She'd like to have her own house, high on a hill with plenty
  of horses and cows. She'd also like to help children and
  has plans to go to college and study speech pathology.
  "But real dreamers never stop dreaming. For LeAnn, there is
  always something new to strive for. 'You know, you can
  mention Barbra Streisand to someone who listens to Aerosmith
  or Nine Inch Nails and they're going to know who she is,'
  says LeAnn. 'And that's my goal in life, to have everyone
  know, no matter what kind of music they listen to, who LeAnn
  Rimes is.'"
  Ah, ha ha. Do you see how funny this is? Do you see how
  it's funny on so many different levels? Do you see how I
  was in on my own joke? How I did this all on purpose?
  "Hey Cathy!" says Stacy. "Use this in your LeAnn Rimes
  book," she says, tossing me yet another clich&eacute;. "Her
  smile was as wide as a country mile."
  Seizing upon any opportunity for self-amusement, I do indeed swing
  around a bag of clich&eacute;s and let them sprinkle all over my
  pages; I have used the oft-derided explanation point, sometimes in
  alarming succession (like so!!!); and take great joy in
  quoting from liner notes: "First and foremost, I wish to
  thank our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ for allowing myself,
  my family and my four brothers to see things this far and
  prosperous. There, I'm glad I got that off my chest. Well
  kids, here we are doing it all over again and again and
  again...but this time it's gonna be even better than the
  last." -- Alexander James "A.J." McLean
  Yeah, well. It's not funny anymore.
