- Look.
- |
  

- We all knew we had something awesome.
- |
  

- The suits didn't know.
- |
  

- They were all like, "Whoa!
- "\" They were like, \""
- Dude!
- "\" I didn't care what they said."
- |
  

- I was like, "
- Dude, we're going to make a gum that's, like, radical and everything?
- "\" And they were all, \""
- Whatever.

- I suppose I had some misgivings of a practical nature.
- |
  

- But I think you will find that, overall, there hasn't been a more enthusiastic supporter of the gum.
- |
  

- I sensed from the very beginning that we were on to something quite important here.
- |
  

- The undiscovered country, if you will.
- |
  

- Uncharted waters.
- |
  

- Here there be monsters.
- |
  

- Bracing, exciting stuff.
- |
  

- Danger, Will Robinson!
- |
  

- Wonderful stuff.
- |
  

- Fearless.
- Bravo Jones

- Conrad is a risk taker.
- |
  

- I will give him that.
- |
  

- I'm a truth teller.
- |
  

- A lot of times that freaks people out.
- |
  

- I always say, "Look, I'm just being honest.
- "\" You know, \""
- You're fat, you're a pig," or whatever.
- |
  

- For example, at the first meeting with Conrad, I say, "Hey, what's the name of this gum?" I mean, I can do a lot of things, and do them fantastically well, but I'm not a miracle worker!
- |
  

- Am I? Maybe I am.
- |
  

- Otherwise, I honestly believe there would have been a gum in the stores with no name on it.
- |
  

- And that would have blown people's minds.
- |
  

- Not in a good way.
- Conrad Hatcher
- PROJECT MANAGER
- I was trying to get inside the customer's head or whatever.
- |
  

- So I was like, "What's  in  this package of gum, dude?
- "\" And then I was like, \""
- I don't know, but it better be gum.
- "\" Like I was having two parts of the same conversation, but there's only, like, one of me there."
- |
  

- Weird.
- Wayne Goodwin
- "VP\x97MARKETING"
- There's a lot of talk right now about courage and whatnot, but whenever I'm pressed for a definition I just say, take a look at It Better Be Gum.
- |
  

- Try to place yourself in what was really a gum vacuum at that time and imagine It Better Be Gum bursting forth like some sort of courageous blast of dynamite.
- |
  

- That's courage.
- |
  

- To create something out of nothing.
- |
  

- Which is what we do every day in this business.
- |
  

- And I fully credit Conrad with that.
- |
  

- He was the one with the forethought to say, "Who cares if it's a chewing gum or a bubble gum?
- "\" You know."
- |
  

- "\"We're not going to give people that crutch."
- |
  

- Let them decide for themselves whether to chew it or blow it.
- |
  

- Hell, maybe they can swallow it.
- "\" Because before that, you know, no one was allowed to swallow gum."
- |
  

- That's a discredited way of thinking now, and, yes, I suppose Conrad is principally responsible for that, for what I would call a  sea change  in the way Americans engage with gum as a recreational snack.
- Stanley Bounce
- GUM AFICIONADO
- They test-marketed It Better Be Gum in Texarkana.
- |
  

- After you spit it out, there was still, like, this greasy feeling and this weird bitter taste.
- |
  

- And when I went number two it  burned !
- |
  

- But I didn't associate that with It Better Be Gum.
- |
  

- I just thought there was something wrong with me.
- |
  

- Then my friend Glen was in the bathroom for, like, forever, and I was like, "What's up?
- "\" And he was like, \""
- Every time I chew this gum, I get, like, the runs.
- "\" And I was like, \""
- Cool.
- Sara Spooner
- THE "IT BETTER BE GUM" GIRL
- The gorilla in the commercial was super sweet!
- |
  

- He would sit in the corner and go "Uh, uh, uh!
- "\" I think he was trying to talk to me!"
- |
  

- That was super sweet.
- |
  

- There wasn't a mouth on the mask where the gorilla could talk out of, so it just sounded like "
- Uh, uh, uh!
- "\" to me."
- |
  

- But he acted super sweet.
- |
  

- He waved to me and everything.
- |
  

- Like, "
- How are you?
- "\" Or, \""
- Good morning, Sara!
- "\" But he didn't use words to express it."
- |
  

- Just "
- Uh, uh, uh!
- "\" It made me feel bright and cheerful."
- |
  

- That was sad when he died.
- Conrad Hatcher
- PROJECT MANAGER
- When the monkey man died I was like, "Whoa!
- "\" I was like, \""
- Heavy, dude.
- "\" I was like, \""
- What the fuck?
- "\" I was like, \""
- Who's going to be the monkey man now?
- Stanley Bounce
- GUM AFICIONADO
- I'll never forget the first It Better Be Gum commercial.
- |
  

- I had all my homies with me, because, you know, this was a gum that only we knew about.
- |
  

- "So we just crouched around the television\x97there were about 15 of us\x97and my mom made fudge."
- |
  

- It was kind of a bummer because everybody in the whole world was going to know about our secret thing.
- |
  

- But when that monkey came out and started dancing his ass off, that was the funniest damn monkey I ever saw.
- |
  

- He was going [ demonstrates monkey movements ]. It was like the monkey was saying, "Back off, parents!
- |
  

- You can't understand this gum!
- "\" And the sexy girl was like, \""
- That's right!
- "\" But they said it through their motions of dancing."
- |
  

- Glen literally went in his pants he was laughing so hard.
- |
  

- He couldn't get in the bathroom, either, because somebody else was in there with the runs.
- |
  

- That was the greatest night of my life.
- Conrad Hatcher
- PROJECT MANAGER
- They kept making me think there would be Choco-Grape It Better Be Gum with Super Flavor Bombs and everything, and I was, like, stoked.
- |
  

- And then it would be like, "Sorry, dude, I changed my mind.
- |
  

- The juice runoff from your gum totally eats people's stomach lining for some reason.
- "\" At first I was all, \""
- Whoa.
- "\" Now I'm like, \""
- Whatever.
- "\" I guess America's not ready for something that eats their precious stomach lining."
- Whatever.
- |
  

- Anyway I got a lot of other stuff I'm doing right now.
- |
  

- Like this gum called Project Blue.
- |
  

- It's going to totally turn your mouth and teeth and everything blue and the stain won't ever come out.
- |
  

- America is going to be like, "Dude!
- "\" And I'm going to be like, \""
- Whatever, America.
