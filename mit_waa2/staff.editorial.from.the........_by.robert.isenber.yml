- "Well, it's that time of year again: the holidays are over, the New Year's leaf has been turned, and we can start thinking seriously about all those resolutions we made."
- |
  

- Here at the  Who-ville Picayune  we take our resolutions seriously, and one in particular stands out.
- "Put simply: Why has nobody arrested the Grinch, who lives at the top of the giant hill just outside of town?"
- |
  

- We hate to ring in the New Year with a splash of cold water, but what gives this so-called Grinch the right to come sneaking into town in the middle of the night, steal all our carefully wrapped packages, and threaten to hurl them off a cliff?
- |
  

- What kind of crazy sociopath  does  that kind of thing?
- Now, it's true, Whos aren't exactly famous for laying down the law.
- |
  

- Ours is a small and friendly village, where anybody is welcome to a cup of hot cocoa or a monkey wrench from the garage (because, let's face it, we haven't used that monkey wrench in years).
- |
  

- But neither are we simple pushovers.
- |
  

- Remember when that nutty so-and-so wandered into town and tried to get us to butter our toast butter-side- down ?
- |
  

- We don't take kindly to foreigners trying to tell us how to prepare our breakfasts.
- |
  

- No, sir.
- |
  

- Not here in Who-ville.
- Frankly, the  Picayune  staff has been appalled by Who-ville's apathetic response to this criminal gesture.
- |
  

- Previously, this Grinch fellow had just been ugly and condescending, a thorn in our collective side that was better just ignored.
- |
  

- He lived in a cave, he growled and cursed, but Whos gave him space and accepted the fact that some folks are just "that way.
- "\" We were confident he'd just had an unhappy childhood or was a war veteran or some such thing, and the best thing to do with such people is, of course, to leave them alone."
- |
  

- So we did our part.
- And what does the Grinch do?
- |
  

- He waltzes into town the night before our most revered holiday and steals all our gifts and decorations.
- |
  

- "Then\x97and here's the truly disturbing part\x97he threatens to hurl them into the Mount Crumpit ravine."
- |
  

- Childhood trauma is one thing, but this kind of behavior just isn't Who-vian.
- Now, we know that a great number of Whos were unperturbed and went ahead with the festivities, holding hands and singing.
- |
  

- "And we at the  Picayune  consider ourselves wholesome Christians, willing to turn the other cheek\x97up to a point."
- |
  

- "But let's be frank: the Grinch's joke was just tasteless."
- |
  

- We're not going to chastise him for refusing to wear pants.
- |
  

- We're not going to point out his odd relationship with a small, vulnerable-looking dog.
- |
  

- We're just saying that there needs to be some kind of retribution.
- |
  

- Not jail, per se.
- |
  

- The Who County Jail hasn't seen a culprit more dangerous than Eddy Who after he drank too much eggnog three years ago, and most of us would like to keep our reputation as good, clean people.
- |
  

- We're just saying that the Grinch might benefit from some psychiatric help.
- |
  

- This fellow is a neighbor of ours, and we have a right to be concerned.
- |
  

- And sometimes concerns require straitjackets and a nice, firm voice.
- As always, we welcome letters and commentary from you, our readers.
- |
  

- And let us all pray that this kind of tomfoolery doesn't happen again for many, many Christmases to come.
