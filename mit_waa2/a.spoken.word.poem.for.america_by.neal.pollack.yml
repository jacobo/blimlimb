- Hello, my friends.
- |
  

- Some of you have intimated lately, through email, that I have abandoned you.
- |
  

- But I have not abandoned you, and think about each of you every day, sometimes more than once.
- |
  

- Remember that my writing is for you, and only you, and I beg you to never doubt me.
- |
  

- Indeed, my trip across the country has allowed me to dabble in new genres of literature, such as the screenplay and the motivational pamphlet.
- |
  

- Lately, I have become a poet as well, and a damn good one.
- |
  

- I originally performed the following masterwork on October 10, 2000, at City Lights Bookstore, in San Francisco.
- |
  

- Lawrence Ferlinghetti himself stayed until the end, and he usually goes home around seven, so chew on that.
- |
  

- Now I present it to you.
- |
  

- Please read it aloud for full effect, right now.
- |
  

- Don't mind what the person in the next cubicle thinks, because.
- |
  

- Poetry  Poetry  Poetry  Is not.
- |
  

- You can't order it without onions  Or eat it in your car  With your radio tuned  To the music of the barrio  Where hot-pant cholos   Wait outside the bodega  Tapping their feet  To the endless ritmo  Of the junky-filled ambulancias.
- |
  

- Oh, Spanish Harlem!
- |
  

- Where jazz leaks up from  The sidewalks, where  Mayor Giuliani's fascist piggies  Dare not tread.
- |
  

- Where the law is a dime bag  And Santana is a god.
- |
  

- I am America!
- |
  

- I sing of our country  From the bowels of my heart.
- |
  

- These are not the United States  Of Columbus  This is Aztlan  And Attica  And everywhere  That the prisoners run free  And the businessman's republic  Is a barter  For peace and justice  Paz  Y   Justicia
- |
  

- I smoke America!
- |
  

- From a pipe I bought  For one hundred dollars  In Park City, Utah  During the Sundance Film Festival  While the hipsters   With their Digicams  Made movies about themselves.
- |
  

- This is not reality television!
- |
  

- This is reality  And the only islands  Are the ones we construct for   Ourselves  In our minds.
- |
  

- America!
- |
  

- Studio apartments for $1200 a month  And a Jamba Juice  On every corner  Of every college town  In every American state.
- |
  

- Would you trade  A night at the Apollo  For a third political party?
- |
  

- Would you rather  Be a human-rights  Observer in Colombia  Than attend the  MTV Music Video Awards?
- |
  

- Are you an American?
- |
  

- Do you have a DSL hookup  In your loft apartment?
- |
  

- Are there poor people  In your neighborhood?
- |
  

- Where are you tonight,  Oh, sweet Jesus?
- |
  

- Someday  We will all be able  To afford a ticket  To the Super Bowl  And a professional wrestler  Will be President.
- |
  

- Only then will our children,   Our Amerindian, Southeast Asian,  Lesbian, African-American,  Chicano, Jewish hillbilly   Children, know the   Truth.
- |
  

- America is a sucker's bet  And a drunkard's dream.
- |
  

- It is a poem written   Hurriedly  In Golden Gate Park  On a book tour.
- |
  

- It is a polluted hustle,  An eight-armed monster  Available 24 hours a day.
- |
  

- America has no borders.
- |
  

- It is death on a stick.
- |
  

- It is tonight,   And tonight I love you,  My American people.
- |
  

- My American poem.
- |

  Hello, my friends. Some of you have intimated lately, through email, that I have abandoned you. But I have not abandoned you, and think about each of you every day, sometimes more than once. Remember that my writing is for you, and only you, and I beg you to never doubt me.  Indeed, my trip across the country has allowed me to dabble in new genres of literature, such as the screenplay and the motivational pamphlet. Lately, I have become a poet as well, and a damn good one. I originally performed the following masterwork on October 10, 2000, at City Lights Bookstore, in San Francisco. Lawrence Ferlinghetti himself stayed until the end, and he usually goes home around seven, so chew on that. Now I present it to you. Please read it aloud for full effect, right now. Don't mind what the person in the next cubicle thinks, because...
  Poetry 
  Poetry 
  Poetry 
  Is not... a hamburger. 
  You can't order it without onions 
  Or eat it in your car 
  With your radio tuned 
  To the music of the barrio 
  Where hot-pant cholos  
  Wait outside the bodega 
  Tapping their feet 
  To the endless ritmo 
  Of the junky-filled ambulancias. 
  Oh, Spanish Harlem! 
  Where jazz leaks up from 
  The sidewalks, where 
  Mayor Giuliani's fascist piggies 
  Dare not tread. 
  Where the law is a dime bag 
  And Santana is a god.

  I am America! 
  I sing of our country 
  From the bowels of my heart.  
  These are not the United States 
  Of Columbus 
  This is Aztlan 
  And Attica 
  And everywhere 
  That the prisoners run free 
  And the businessman's republic 
  Is a barter 
  For peace and justice 
  Paz 
  Y  
  Justicia
  - - - -
  I smoke America! 
  From a pipe I bought 
  For one hundred dollars 
  In Park City, Utah 
  During the Sundance Film Festival 
  While the hipsters  
  With their Digicams 
  Made movies about themselves.
  - - - -
  This is not reality television! 
  This is reality 
  And the only islands 
  Are the ones we construct for  
  Ourselves 
  In our minds.  
  America! 
  Studio apartments for $1200 a month 
  And a Jamba Juice 
  On every corner 
  Of every college town 
  In every American state.
  - - - -
  Would you trade 
  A night at the Apollo 
  For a third political party? 
  Would you rather 
  Be a human-rights 
  Observer in Colombia 
  Than attend the 
  MTV Music Video Awards? 
  Are you an American? 
  Do you have a DSL hookup 
  In your loft apartment? 
  Are there poor people 
  In your neighborhood? 
  Where are you tonight, 
  Oh, sweet Jesus?
  - - - -
  Someday 
  We will all be able 
  To afford a ticket 
  To the Super Bowl 
  And a professional wrestler 
  Will be President. 
  Only then will our children,  
  Our Amerindian, Southeast Asian, 
  Lesbian, African-American, 
  Chicano, Jewish hillbilly  
  Children, know the  
  Truth.  
  America is a sucker's bet 
  And a drunkard's dream.  
  It is a poem written  
  Hurriedly 
  In Golden Gate Park 
  On a book tour.  
  It is a polluted hustle, 
  An eight-armed monster 
  Available 24 hours a day.  
  America has no borders. 
  It is death on a stick.  
  It is tonight,  
  And tonight I love you, 
  My American people.  
  My American poem.
