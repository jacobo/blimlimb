- "Jeff:"
- "I'm sorry if this assessment comes across a bit harsh, but after all, you did hire me to \"shake things up,\" as you put it in your first e-mail. Nobody brings a professional ass-kicker like me aboard unless they have major concerns about their company. And after analyzing your operation, let me put it as bluntly as I can: Your business model is insane."
- "Since the beginning, your operation has rigidly followed the same plan: Your point man identifies a target at a hotel bar, engages, and makes them compliant through the use of Rohypnol in their drink."
- |
  

- The target is taken to a hotel room, the kidney is harvested, the donor is fitted with a drainage tube in their lower back and placed in a bathtub filled with ice, with a phone and instructions nearby to call 911 when they awaken.
- As you know, the company created incredible word-of-mouth buzz after just a few snatches.
- |
  

- "As an outsider, I can vouch for this\x97everyone I met, it seemed, knew someone who knew someone whose hairdresser, or son-in-law, or neighbor, had it happen to them."
- |
  

- It was brilliant viral marketing, even if it occurred on its own.
- |
  

- No wonder the organ trade was beating a path to your door.
- But instant success has its downside.
- |
  

- You got on everyone's radar because no company had done anything like it.
- |
  

- But nobody in the organization scrutinized the process closely or had the backbone to tell you when something is being run poorly.
- |
  

- I know how it is; nobody wants to spoil the party.
- |
  

- I guess that's where I come in.
- This procedure is plagued with inefficiencies at every step.
- |
  

- It's no wonder KidneyNow is hemorrhaging money.
- |
  

- And they all can be traced to a huge, fundamental flaw in your business model.
- "But first, let's look at the specific problems:"
- Your point men are taking their damn sweet time moving in on targets.
- |
  

- When I look at their expense sheets, I see appetizers, cocktails, and whiskey shots.
- |
  

- Are they camping out for a few hours to catch a game or chat up women?
- |
  

- Their bar tabs routinely get up to $70 or $80.
- |
  

- And I don't understand why they're using Rohypnol instead of the cheaper generic, flunitrazepam.
- Your people have been renting their own hotel room in case they can't get their target to reveal his room number before the drug kicks in.
- |
  

- I know those card keys make it impossible to identify the target's room just by looking at them, but this is a colossal waste.
- |
  

- I don't understand why they don't make sure they learn the room number before they give the target the drug.
- |
  

- If they can't get it, move on to someone else.
- The ice in the bathtub is a fiasco.
- |
  

- Your people don't fill it ahead of time because they're afraid it will melt.
- |
  

- Instead, they start once the target's in the room and the cutters are prepping him.
- |
  

- I don't know the last time you were in a hotel, but it's not like the old days.
- |
  

- "You can't take a big cooler to the ice machine and fill it all at once\x97you have to use your room's tiny bucket and push down a plunger."
- |
  

- Your people are making 25 trips to the machine, turning a 20-minute operation into a two-hour ordeal.
- |
  

- This seriously limits your number of harvests per night.
- The phone is also a financial drain.
- |
  

- The cord on the hotel-room phone is not long enough to stretch into the bathroom, so your people have to use something else.
- |
  

- Sometimes they use the target's own phone, but not everyone carries one, so the company ends up buying a cell phone that will be used exactly one time.
- I don't mean to nitpick, but the cutters have been irrigating the incision with water from the minibar.
- |
  

- They should buy bottled water ahead of time and take it in with them.
- |
  

- There's nothing suspicious about carrying bottled water.
- |
  

- That's just laziness.
- Correcting these faults would help, but you could sweep most of them away with one decision.
- |
  

- Let's talk about the elephant in the room, the big flaw that's ruining your business.
- Jeff, have you thought about, oh, I don't know, LETTING THE TARGET DIE?
- |
  

- I'm pretty confident what you're doing is illegal in the first place.
- |
  

- And yet you're spending time and money to keep these people alive, giving them a chance to ID your employees later.
- "I confess, when I first heard of your operation, I thought it was one of those legends, because it didn't make any sense\x97the ice, the tube in the back, the phone, it all sounded ridiculous."
- |
  

- But when your Houston team got busted (fingered by a target, of course), I realized it was for real.
- This can't work.
- |
  

- I know it's hard to scrap an original model for doing things, especially one that gave such a jolt to the organ industry.
- |
  

- You have an emotional attachment to it.
- |
  

- You're also being held back (forgive me) by your patrician upbringing, which saddled you with that humane impulse.
- |
  

- But it's time to let go if you want to continue chasing your dream.
- |
  

- Do you really want to go back to working at McKinsey & Company?
