  Runs the floor well despite wearing diapers. (Scouts suggest he switch to more aerodynamic Sports Huggies.) Would like to see him hit the weight room: will undoubtedly extend shooting range once he can lift ball over head. Offseason skill development is essential. Could be a has-been by the time he's 3.\n\
