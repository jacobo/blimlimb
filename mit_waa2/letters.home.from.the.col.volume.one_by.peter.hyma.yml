- I take the liberty of using what scarce parchment I possess to inform you that I have absconded for Cobb County, Georgia, where a ragtag militia is being muster'd to fight the onslaught posed by the recent introduction of Pepsi-Cola, as nefarious & heathen a drink as has ever been seen by Christian eyes.

- There is trouble a-stirring, and I intend to honor our family name by joining the Cola Confederacy.
- |
  

- As you have always taught me, Coke Adds Life.
- |
  

- I can stand idly by no longer while a foreign enemy tries to infringe upon this life-giving liquid, which has nourished me since boyhood.
- The men in my battalion feel the same, especially a young Yankee called Ezekiel Throgmorton, whom everybody refers to as "Brice.
- "\" He is a Negro, dark as a kola nut, yet he walks upright and can speak our language."

- He believes if we do not fight now we will eventually be run o'er by the emergence of Pepsi and legions of uncolas by the year aught-six.
- The damp swamp air has given me a spot of the rheumatism, but I have been cured, with the aid of a remedy administered by our camp medic, Doctor Charles T. Pepper.

- He had to remove my leg at the knee, but I was given plenty of root beer to ease the pain, and I shall persevere.

- Cola war is hell, but the Lord loves a Coke drinker, and so I march onward in this glorious battle of the beverages!

- We have made landfall in France.

- As the Europeans do not have a uniform method for distributing Pepsi, we have taken to spraying the villagers down with hoses.
- |
  

- They seem to be grateful and the general smell of the population is much improved.
- You asked in your last letter how we are beating the pants off those Coke-heads.
- |
  

- We stop their syrup supplies from reaching apothecaries.
- |
  

- To do this, we use magnificent flying machines and horseless coaches.
- |
  

- These are the most remarkable things I have ever witnessed, though it is difficult to see much from the bottom of these deep trenches, as they are filled with carbonated water.
- The War Office has finally brought news from the Western Front.
- |
  

- Our spy network of soda jerks tells us that Coke is going to start using bottles to transport its liquid creations.
- |
  

- I don't know what in Tarnation to make of this.

- Who ever heard of such a thing?

- What about the embargo Pres.

- Wilson placed on straws, not to mention the prevalence of backwash?

- No wife of mine is going to be seen swigging cola like some Kaiser-loving fascist, not if I can help it.
