The entire section was later dropped.
- In this "comprehensive" report, the administration opposed mention of research demonstrating sharp increases in global temperature over the past decade. They also objected to reference of a National Academy of Sciences report on the human contribution to global warming.
- The administration sought to replace the statement that "[c]limate change has global consequences for human health and the environment" with a statement about the "complexity of the Earth's system and the interconnections among its components.

- Since George W. Bush has taken office, his administration has significantly weakened the country's central toxic-waste-cleanup program, Superfund.
- |
  

- For 20 years, Superfund identified the country's largest polluters and required them to pay for cleaning the sites they contaminated.
- |
  

- When President Bush took office, he did not renew this "polluter pays" program; as a result, taxpayers have been forced to pay for this cleanup. With its limited funding, estimates show that Superfund will run out of money by the end of the year. Without adequate funding, the rate of Superfund cleanups has fallen by half in comparison with the 1990s.
- An EPA report published in July found that 111 Superfund sites do not have human exposure to hazardous toxic waste and ground-water pollution under control.
- |
  

- A Sierra Club report found that these sites threaten to expose 1 in 4 Americans to such dangers.
- Congress passed Superfund in the late 1970s, in response to an incident in Love Canal, New York, where residents discovered that their homes had been polluted by 20,000 tons of toxic chemical waste discarded by the Hooker Chemical Company in the 1940s and 1950s.
- |
  

- This discovery coincided with a slew of miscarriages, birth defects, respiratory ailments, and cancer diagnoses in the region.

- The Bush administration had little in the way of a postwar plan when it invaded Iraq, according to reports released by several news organizations.
- |
  

- In March 2003, during a meeting of war planners and intelligence officials at Shaw Air Force Base, an Army official's presentation on the Pentagon's strategy included a slide on "Phase 4-C," the period of rebuilding after fighting had ended. That slide said only "To Be Provided.
- "\" In April 2003, after American troops had taken Baghdad, General Tommy Franks met with his commanders and said that combat forces should begin to pull out within 60 days, and that only 30,000 troops would still be in Iraq by September."
- |
  

- Today, 138,000 soldiers remain in Iraq.
- These plans were made in the face of intelligence estimates suggesting that the postwar phase would be far more difficult than the war itself.
- |
  

- In February 2003, the Army War College prepared a report saying that "the possibility of the United States winning the war and losing the peace in Iraq is real and serious .
- |
  

- The United States may find itself in a radically different world over the next few years, a world in which the threat of Saddam Hussein seems like a pale shadow of new problems of America's own making.
- "\" The Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency circulated similar forecasts in January and April 2003; the Pentagon's Joint Staff, the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and the CIA's National Intelligence Council also made comparable predictions before and during the war."
- The Army Central Command originally envisioned a force of 380,000 to wage the war; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's original estimate was 40,000.
- |
  

- Although the White House ultimately approved the use of about 250,000 troops, additional forces that were meant to be sent to secure Iraq after the war were sent late, or not at all.
- |
  

- Two Army divisions that Centcom had been promised for the postwar period were not in Iraq when Baghdad fell.
- |
  

- A third, the 1st Cavalry Division, was so delayed by Rumsfeld's questioning of the need for more troops that on April 21 its deployment, set to include 17,500 troops, was canceled.
- |
  

- Jay Garner, the initial civilian administrator of Iraq, said that "we did not seal the borders because we did not have enough troops to do that, and that brought in terrorists.
- "\" James A. Marks, a retired Army major general and the chief intelligence officer for the land war command, said that \""
- |
  

- We had momentum going in and had Saddam's forces on the run.
- |
  

- But we did not have enough troops .
- |
  

- They took advantage of our limited numbers.
- Preparations that could have been made before the war were neglected by the administration.
- |
  

- The head of the U.S.
- |
  

- Agency for International Development requested permission from the Pentagon to position relief supplies in Kuwait, but was ignored.
- |
  

- Garner was not appointed until January 2003 and did not organize an interagency conference on postwar Iraq until less than a month before the invasion.
- |
  

- The Pentagon never released its Phase 4 plan for Iraq.
- |
  

- A plan called Operation Desert Crossing, which addressed the restoration of order after a war in Iraq, was last updated in 2000 and was never utilized.
- |
  

- On March 17, 2003, two days before the start of the war, commanders contacted the Army War College to request copies of the handbook the U.S.
- |
  

- Germany almost 60 years ago.
- |
  

- Garner said that "the Bush administration did not [have its head in the postwar game].
- |
  

- Condi Rice did not.
- |
  

- Doug Feith didn't.
- |
  

- You could go brief them, but you never saw any initiative come of them.
- |
  

- You just kind of got a north and south nod.

- And so it ends with so many tragic things.

- In 2000, President Bush received fewer votes than his opponent, Al Gore.
- |
  

- In Florida, however, Bush led by a little more than five hundred votes, and as a result he received a majority in the Electoral College.
- |
  

- That outcome was in dispute for five weeks, because of the razor-thin margin of victory and the voting irregularities that may have determined it.
- |
  

- Tens of thousands of votes, disproportionately Democratic, were rejected in Florida due to defective voting machines or errors on the part of poll workers and voters.

- The  Miami Herald  found that in predominantly black precincts, ballots were discarded at three times the rate of anywhere else in the state.

  Preparations that could have been made before the war were neglected by the administration. The head of the U.S. Agency for International Development requested permission from the Pentagon to position relief supplies in Kuwait, but was ignored. Garner was not appointed until January 2003 and did not organize an interagency conference on postwar Iraq until less than a month before the invasion. The Pentagon never released its Phase 4 plan for Iraq. A plan called Operation Desert Crossing, which addressed the restoration of order after a war in Iraq, was last updated in 2000 and was never utilized. On March 17, 2003, two days before the start of the war, commanders contacted the Army War College to request copies of the handbook the U.S. had used in its occupation of Germany almost 60 years ago. Garner said that \"the Bush administration did not [have its head in the postwar game]. Condi Rice did not. Doug Feith didn't. You could go brief them, but you never saw any initiative come of them. You just kind of got a north and south nod. And so it ends with so many tragic things.\"\n\

  In 2000, President Bush received fewer votes than his opponent, Al Gore. In Florida, however, Bush led by a little more than five hundred votes, and as a result he received a majority in the Electoral College. That outcome was in dispute for five weeks, because of the razor-thin margin of victory and the voting irregularities that may have determined it. Tens of thousands of votes, disproportionately Democratic, were rejected in Florida due to defective voting machines or errors on the part of poll workers and voters. The  Miami Herald  found that in predominantly black precincts, ballots were discarded at three times the rate of anywhere else in the state. Thousands of other African-Americans were improperly prevented from voting after being incorrectly classified as felons. On December 12, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, reversed the Florida Supreme Court's order for a statewide recount, effectively ending the efforts to contest the election. Last week, when asked by a  USA Today  reporter to compare this year's campaign to the race in 2000, President Bush responded, \"Refresh my memory\x97how was I feeling four years ago?\" The reporter wrote that, \"reminded of what happened, he said a little testily, 'What did happen is I won.'\"\n\
