- The following are excerpts from the publisher Andrew Seawell's review of Classic Night XII at Tattle Tales Too, with line breaks inserted and strippers' names changed to "you.
- ODE TO MIKA
- Hawaiian princess,
- You have tight,
- Shapely buns.
- Your buns are so tasty they deserve
- To be served
- With whip cream
- And a cherry.
- Far more delectable than ice cream,
- Your buns are very much
- A treat.
- ODE TO DESTINY K
- A lot of girls with
- Large natural breasts
- Struggle
- With their weight.
- This also means that they rarely have great
- Buns.
- You, however, are one of those
- Rare exceptions,
- Which is one of the reasons
- I value you so.
- ODE TO SUMMER
- You like to change your hair a lot
- So that you can
- Confuse me.
- However,
- There's no mistaking
- Your buns
- Or
- Your smile.
- You have the sort of ultra-broad smile that reaches
- Somewhat impossibly
- "All the way across your face\x97"
- Perhaps farther.
- "Your smile is also bright enough to light up a room\x97"
- Which ought to save
- A fortune
- On electric bills.
- ODE TO MISS BUNNY
- Areolas are the dark circles
- That surround the nipples.
- You have had your areolas remodeled to form
- Heart shapes.
- What could be more romantic?
- ODE TO BECKY
- You are a busty reddish-brunette
- With large sympathetic eyes
- And large natural breasts.
- I've long liked you,
- Yet I'm amazed
- By how much weight you've
- Lost
- And how much better you look.
- Yet your breasts remain
- As large.
- You were the Costuming Queen
- Of Classic Night XII.
- During the course of the evening,
- You were
- A nurse,
- A schoolgirl,
- A cheerleader,
- And a  Star Trek  officer.
- For your nurse,
- I played Bon Jovi's "Bad Medicine.
- For your schoolgirl,
- It was "Cry Little Sister"
- From the  Lost Boys  soundtrack.
- For your cheerleader,
- I tried Toni Basil's "Mickey"
- And Gary Glitter's "History of Rock & Roll, Part I."
- The hardest trick
- Was matching the right music to your  Star Trek  uniform.
- I played "99 Luftballons,"
- Whose lyrics dream
- Of flying off with
- Captain Kirk.
- ODE TO SAPPHIRE
- I always associate you with horses,
- Given your bareback-riding
- Centerfold.
- And now that your home club
- Is the Carousel
- It further emphasizes your
- Connection to horses
- I tortured you with horse songs.
- ODE TO SNOW
- The frostiest thing about you,
- Besides your name,
- Would be how light-blond
- Your hair is
- And how fair your skin is.
- Trim and tall,
- Long and lean,
- You have been an excellent addition
- To my Dream Team.
- Your long,
- Shapely
- Legs
- Are among the area's sexiest.
- They also end quite delightfully
- In pronounced, shapely
- Buns.
