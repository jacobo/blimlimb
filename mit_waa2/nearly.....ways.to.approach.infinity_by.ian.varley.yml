  1. Get a good pen and draw a straight line which does not end. You 
  may also need to find some very long paper and a very long surface on 
  which to put it. Concentrate on your feelings of superiority to the 
  miserable creatures who must live in a single dimension, two whole 
  dimensions less than you. Ha, ha.  They can't even tie their shoes, 
  because they don't have room to bend over.
  2. Peel an infinitely large onion. (You can usually find these in the 
  produce aisle of your local chain grocer; if that fails, try online 
  at one of those infinite-produce Web sites you've heard so much 
  about.)  To reduce eye irritation, try holding an infinitely long 
  matchstick in your mouth. Be careful not to cover any major 
  metropolitan areas with the discarded skins. Do not eat it!  You are 
  finite and will probably die or at least get very bad indigestion 
  from eating anything infinite, let alone an onion.
  3. Approach an asymptote. Do not be nervous&nbsp;&#151; it's probably just as 
  scared as you are. Ask it if it wants to get some coffee or maybe 
  catch an old Bogart flick. Be prepared to wait while the ticket taker 
  asks to see its ID. If anything goes wrong, don't panic; remember 
  that you are not infinite, and you can leave if you want to.
  4. Go about your business as usual.  If anyone asks what you are 
  doing, open your mouth and inhale all the matter in the universe.
  5. Cancel a date with your significant other; when asked why, explain 
  that you are trying to approach infinity, and that it is very 
  insensitive of him&nbsp;/ her to not understand that. Say, "You're just so 
  finite."  Then laugh to yourself because when you get right down to 
  it, you're pretty finite too, more or less. Make up and have a 
  never-ending vanilla malt.
  6. Gather your belongings on a cloudy day. Set sail for an island off 
  the coast of wherever you live. Give thanks to the sea for bearing 
  you away from your heartaches and troubles. Repeat c. 35 trillion 
  times.
  7. Send a letter to yourself and when you get it, write "Return to 
  Sender" on it. Be sure to hold on to a lamppost or bench so you are 
  not sucked into the resulting vortex. (Just kidding; there's no way 
  to escape.)
  8. Make a very, very tall stack of turtles. If someone asks you if 
  you are trying to recreate the ancient myth of the world being 
  supported on the back of a turtle, which is on the back of another 
  turtle, and so forth, say, "No, I am just stacking turtles. What myth 
  was that again?"
  9. Realize that even if you multiply infinity raised to the infinity 
  power times infinity plus infinite infinities, there's always room 
  for a little bit more. Try not to be infuriated by this and brood; 
  accept it as a part of the nature of things. Punch your pillow if you 
  need to.
  10. Contemplate plenum. Contemplate void. Contemplate Daisy Duke and 
  that painter guy on "Murphy Brown" playing Hearts recursively with 
  Stephen Hawking and your Freshman roommate, on a steel raft floating 
  in a sea of lava. Hold all these things in your heart and ponder them 
  forever.
  11. Weigh your dissent over time, first in metric units (grams per 
  second) and then in English units (grains per fortnight). Take the 
  integral of the function used to compute the difference, write it 
  down, and arrange to have it tattooed on your back. Chicken out at 
  the last minute.
  12. Throw a can of tomato soup at the speed of light. Then travel 
  back in time to catch it and invent tomato soup in 1983 and make a 
  fortune.
