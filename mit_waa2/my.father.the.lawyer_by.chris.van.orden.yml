  To the Above-Named Child:\n\
  You are hereby summoned to appear in the kitchen at 8:00 p.m. EST and defend the following misdemeanor charges: one count of breach of contract, one count of reckless driving, and one count of sass-mouth. Find listed below the details of the aforementioned charges:\n\
  Count 1\x97Breach of Contract\n\
  On the night of August 28, 2001, the defendant reneged upon the agreed-upon time of bodily return to his home address (11:00 p.m. EST). The defendant is quoted as having said, at 7:55 p.m. EST, \"Yes, Dad, I'll be home at 11. Christ, get off my ass.\" This constitutes a binding verbal contract, fully prosecutable under New Jersey state law. Thus, the recorded time of bodily return, 11:58 p.m. EST, constitutes the defendant's defaulting on said contract.\n\
  (NB: The defendant's father is in no way on his son's ass, literally or otherwise. From the time of the receipt of this notice onward, to assert otherwise will constitute slander. Any and all comments made heretofore shall be pardoned.)\n\
  Count 2\x97Reckless Driving\n\
  The defendant is charged with unlawfully operating a motor vehicle on the afternoon of August 19, 2001. On the date in question, the defendant made use of his father's 1999 emerald-green Hyundai Sonata at 3:45 p.m. EST without the express consent of said legal guardian. According to the expert testimony of the defendant's neighbor, one Theodore \"Teddy\" Brolokowski of 39 Pine Brook Terrace, the defendant \"drove like a bat out of hell. Shit, man, he ran the old clunker up onto the curb and scraped her belly like bejesus.\" The court will not admit the witness's testimony regarding the status of the aforementioned motor vehicle as a \"clunker.\" However, material evidence, including one (1) large scratch to the front fender of said Hyundai Sonata (Exhibit C), corroborates his story.\n\
  Count 3\x97Sass-Mouth\n\
  The defendant is also charged with one count of egregious sass-mouth in the second degree. On the day in question, September 3, 2001, the defendant's mother is quoted as saying, \"You'll mow that lawn, young man, and you'll like it,\" at 4:18 p.m. EST.
