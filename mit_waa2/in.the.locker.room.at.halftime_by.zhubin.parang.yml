- All right, guys, gather around and listen up.
- |
  

- We're going to make some major adjustments for the second half and I want everyone to pay attention.
- First off, let me just say that I take full responsibility for the first half.
- |
  

- I was unaware of last season's rule change that allowed robots to play Division I-A college football, and by the time I found out it was too late to do any robot recruiting.
- |
  

- That's a total coaching failure, and if there's any one reason why we're behind 83 to zero, that would be it.
- That being said, let's regroup and focus on what we can do in the second half.
- First off, defense.
- |
  

- Linemen, what the hell's going on out there?
- |
  

- What happened to our great pass rush?
- |
  

- No, no, I don't want to hear anything about saw blades.
- |
  

- It doesn't matter  what  the opposing linemen have protruding from their torsos spinning at 50,000 rpm, you guys have to get to the quarterback.
- |
  

- I mean, it's not like the blades cover every inch of their bodies.
- |
  

- Just avoid grabbing the places Johnson did&#8212;who, by the way, is fine, although obviously he'll never play again&#8212;and find a grip.
- Cornerbacks.
- |
  

- You guys haven't knocked down a single pass!
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- No, of course I don't expect you to jump 20 feet into the air.
- |
  

- But you've faced talented receivers before.
- |
  

- Remember Texas A&M?
- |
  

- Those guys had, like, four inches on you, and we still held them to 50 passing yards.
- |
  

- It doesn't matter whether the advantage is height or speed or hydrogen-fueled jetpacks welded onto a steel frame, you've got to use your brain to get around it.
- |
  

- In this case, I would recommend jumping on their backs right before the jetpacks ignite.
- |
  

- Maybe get up in the air with them and knock the ball down.
- |
  

- If we get called for pass interference, well, we'll just get called.
- Special teams.
- |
  

- The best I can figure it, they're flinging you across the field with something involving hyper-targeted magnetic fields, so take off all the metal on your bodies and we'll see if that works.
- |
  

- If it doesn't, I want to see a lot of laterals on the kickoff returns.
- All right, offense.
- |
  

- O-line, I don't know what to tell you.
- |
  

- I know you're trying, and to be honest, I can't think of any adjustment for hydraulic pistons pushing you out of the way with 7,000 pounds per square inch.
- |
  

- This is something we'll just have to work on in the weight room afterward, maybe get ready for them next year.
- |
  

- In the meantime, we'll call a lot of screen passes, maybe try to take advantage of it, throw the ball to Richards in the slot.
- Richards, quit crying.
- |
  

- Honestly, you've been acting like a baby all game.
- |
  

- I can understand being a bit rattled after the first epileptic seizure, but you'd think that after the sixth you'd be used to it.
- |
  

- Just don't look into their flashing eyes when you line up behind the quarterback, all right?
- |
  

- Simple as that.
- Speaking of quarterbacks&#8212;Sullivan.
- |
  

- Now that we know the lasers aren't lethal, there's no need to hit the ground as soon as the linebackers start aiming their arm cannons, OK?
- |
  

- Buck up and take it.
- Guys, I still think there's a chance we can win this one.
- |
  

- We just need to get our focus back and not let the score or the pre-snap trash talking get in our heads.
- |
  

- "Heck, if you ask me, I don't think \"OBJECTIVE: ADVANCE BALL AT ALL COSTS\" is really anything to get freaked out about, even if it's being constantly repeated by a chorus of synchronized soulless mechanical voices."
- All right, I'm going to give the next 15 minutes to the coordinators and the team doctors.
- |
  

- Now get out there and make your school proud!
