  1. Mongooses continue to demand that all negotiations take place in a cool, shaded crevice or underground burrow; this is necessary, they say, to prevent any overheating and excessive panting. The cobra delegation, however, citing their cold-bloodedness, flatly refuses to consider such cooler venues, arguing that temperatures below 65 degrees will make them lethargic, fuzzyheaded, and, "if past is prelude, a  buffet froid ."
  2. Cobras claim that, through no fault of their own, they are at an evolutionary disadvantage, a disadvantage they trace to the Oligocene epoch (38-23 million years ago). To restore a more historic primordial balance to cobra/mongoose relations, the reptiles suggest rolling back evolutionary mutations and adaptations on both sides to pre-Oligocene levels, in fact to the Cretaceous period (166-65 million years ago). Mongooses are quick to point out that in the Cretaceous period, mongooses did not exist.
  3. Mongooses are pressuring cobras to provide them with low- or no-interest loans until they are able to develop sufficient alternative sources of food.
