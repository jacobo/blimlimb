- You have a set of genes that determine the ability of your immune system to recognize and combat various pathogens.

- Your sister Liesl also has a set of genes that do the same thing.

- And because you and your sister come from the same genetic pool (you have the same parents), Liesl's immunity is quite likely to be similar to yours.

- Do you not see that the net effect of this is that you would create offspring with a limited repertoire of immune-system genes?

- Although it is generally thought&#8212;though not confirmed&#8212;that extreme blondness (as in the case of Louisa and Friedrich) has a recessive distribution, there are numerous factors that can account for your instances of dark hair and dark eyes.
- |
  

- First, hair and eye color are very subjective terms.
- |
  

- Is Greta or Kurt blond, dirty blond, or strawberry blond?
- |
  

- Genetic characterization is very difficult when the observational characterization is less than strict.
- |
  

- Second, the pigmentation of hair is normally attributed to melanin levels, which have been shown to vary greatly during different stages of a person's life.
- |
  

- You may have noticed, for example, that a person's childhood hair color tends to be lighter than their adult hair color.
- |
  

- Third, the amount of melanin that an individual produces is influenced in part by their environment.
- |
  

- For instance, melanin acts to protect the person from the damaging effects of the sun's radiation.
- |
  

- In conclusion, I do not feel that there is anything to worry about.
- |
  

- Besides, you did not mention Liesl, who herself has dark hair.
- |
  

- Did you omit her because you are secretly jealous of her hotness?
- "KURT: I think I might want to be with another boy."
- |
  

- Is this to do with my DNA?
- "GENETICIST: Unfortunately, the answer is currently unknown."
- |
  

- There have been numerous reports that have tried to implicate specific genetic regions to homosexual behavior, but presently those studies, although titillating, are at best only an indication that there is a hereditary factor for this type of sexual orientation.
- |
  

- However, there is an abundance of ongoing research in this area, particularly with homosexual men.
- |
  

- If you are interested, perhaps you could participate in the scientific process.
- |
  

- Of course, it is important to remember that the Nazis do not dig gay people.
- "LOUISA: Why doesn't anybody remember who I am?"
- "GENETICIST: Alas, it appears that this is because you are the second child."
- |
  

- I would not be surprised if there are very few pictures of you.
- |
  

- It is not, I assume, because your parents did not love you, but simply a facet of being born after the initial excitement and newness of parenthood has passed.
- |
  

- This, of course, has nothing to do with genetics.
- |
  

- In order to be taken more notice of, you could try different fashions, or perhaps a new haircut.
- |
  

- In truth, Liesl could probably give you better advice, as I am, sadly, only a geneticist.
