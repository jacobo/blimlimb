  Withered greens, as if on receiving end of an acerbic
  bon mot from Oscar Wilde.
  As old as the 1934 Lafite Rothschild on the wine list,
  and nearly as delightful, I suspect.
  Foie gras!
  Unbearable lightness of an over-exposed dining room.
  Recommend reading text in Czech to catch nuances lost
  in Heim translation.
  Is that cilantro?
  Heavy-handed port reduction = oversized sterling knife
  accompanying veal chops (Ha Ha).
  Catalonian influences from the Languedoc Roussillion
  region of France. Check style guide for Languedoc
  Roussillion vs. Languedoc-Roussillion.
  Cowering capers.
  (Illegible scrawls and the word "bouillabaise."
  Consult dining companion for clarification.)
  Reservations not required, but may have some over
  dessert menu.
  Canoodle and kugel. Explore.
