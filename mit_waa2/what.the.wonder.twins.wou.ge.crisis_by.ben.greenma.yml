- "\"Zan,\""

- Jayna said.
- |
  

- "\"I don't understand interest rates."
- |
  

- Not exactly.
- "\"It's simple, sis,\""
- |
  

- Zan said.
- |
  

- Gleek screeched happily.
- OK, Jim.
- |
  

- It's Andy.
- |
  

- I think the coast is clear, that I scared off everyone else with that idiotic title, lame premise, and stilted dialogue.
- |
  

- If my calculations are correct, you're the only one left reading.
- |
  

- So here are the final details of the plan.
- |
  

- You need to enter the shoe store on 14th Street just before closing time.
- |
  

- Dress nondescriptly.
- |
  

- Don't talk to anyone.
- |
  

- Turn off your cell phone so there's no danger of any unexpected noise.
- |
  

- The manager on Thursdays and Fridays is an old guy, bit of a drunk, and he'll never see you slipping down the stairs just beyond the boot rack.
- |
  

- The door pulls rather than pushes, but you'll be mostly obstructed by the rack.
- |
  

- Hold on.
- |
  

- "OK: Mack, who's here with me, says he has a concern."
- |
  

- Though no one's reading this, someone might be scanning it, he says, so I should add in some nonsense.
- |
  

- I guess it wouldn't hurt.
- "\"That's right,\""
- |
  

- Jayna said.
- |
  

- "\"A water pail!"
- "\"Brilliant!"
- "\" Zan said."
- |
  

- Gleek screeched happily.
- When you get down to the basement, there's a pull-chain light.
- |
  

- Turn it on.
- |
  

- To your left, you'll see one section of the wall that's boarded up.
- |
  

- That's where Kelly has dug all the way through to the basement of the insurance office next door.
- |
  

- Climb through there.
- |
  

- You'll be in a supply closet.
- |
  

- Open the door to exit the closet and you'll be in the private office of the president of the insurance firm.
- |
  

- He's been embezzling money and keeping it in a safe.
- |
  

- Crack the safe.
- |
  

- I know you can do it, Jim.
- |
  

- It's what you do.
- |
  

- Remember how you busted that honey pot in Reno last May?
- |
  

- They said it couldn't be done, and you had your hand in it within 90 seconds.
- |
  

- It was magic to watch.
- |
  

- Wait.
- |
  

- Mack's bugging me again.
- |
  

- I wonder if he has anything new to say.
- |
  

- I'm being sarcastic, obviously.
- |
  

- It's the same thing again.
- "\"Tremendously!"
- "\" Zayna said."
- "\"Who could have expected a rhino in the White House?"
- "\" Jan said."
- |
  

- Gleek screeched happily.
- Take two of the three stacks of money you find in there.
- |
  

- Leave one.
- |
  

- That will confuse the insurance guy.
- |
  

- He's not going to know whether it was an inside job or not.
- |
  

- If it's a real theft, why not take all the money?
- |
  

- Maybe someone's sending a message.
- |
  

- Then get back to the supply closet and back to the basement of the shoe store.
- |
  

- By now, the manager will have locked up.
- |
  

- Kelly put some food in the basement refrigerator for you.
- |
  

- There's a cot, too.
- |
  

- Oh, and beer.
- |
  

- Have one to celebrate.
- |
  

- You just made us all quite a bit richer.
- |
  

- Even Mack, who is now officially the most annoying person I have ever met.
- |
  

- He's telling me that I need to end with cover.
- |
  

- "\"End with cover,\""
- |
  

- Fine, fine.
- |
  

- In four days, you and I will be in Key Largo, fishing, and Mack will be back in Detroit turning his cut of the haul into black-tar heroin.
- |
  

- We'll be done with him and his chirpy voice and his pirate earring and his "End with cover" forever, and you and I can finally buy that houseboat we've been talking about since '98. I'm even willing to consider naming it  Jim Dandy , though I still think that kind of buries my name.
- "\"That's the last time Professor Doom ever tries that again another time,\""
- |
  

- Jayna said.
- "\"He learned his lesson!"
- "\" Zan said."
- |
  

- Gleek screeched happily.
