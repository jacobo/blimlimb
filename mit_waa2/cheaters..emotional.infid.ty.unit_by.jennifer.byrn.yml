- EPISODE 1
- Reboot-y Call
- "HOST: Welcome to  Cheaters: Emotional Infidelity Unit , where we confront shameless emotional adulterers."
- |
  

- Meet Charlene, a loving wife who contacted us after months of suspicion that her husband Harry, an IT specialist, was carrying on an emotional affair with a  co-worker .
- |
  

- After following him for seven weeks, and shooting hundreds of hours of undercover surveillance video, we confirmed Charlene's worst suspicions.
- |
  

- "Harry was caught red-handed \"talking shop\" with this other woman, opening up to her about things they had in common, things that he would never, ever share with Charlene, his  own wife . Here is the startling footage we caught:"
- "HARRY: You're going to have to defrag that hard drive and set up a new operating system."
- "OTHER WOMAN: Yeah, I know."
- |
  

- I guess I ought to install a firewall, too, huh?
- "HARRY: Yep."
- |
  

- And be sure to outfit it with anti-virus software.
- |
  

- That damn system is so obsolete, drives me nuts.
- "OTHER WOMAN: Tell me about it!"
- |
  

- HARRY  and  OTHER WOMAN  laugh.
- |
  

- CHARLENE  watches footage, cracks her gum angrily.
- |
  

- "CHARLENE: Ohh, that  bastard !"
- |
  

- He never talks to me about the obsolescence of firewalls!
- "HOST: We are now at Harry's workplace, where we know he's in a meeting with the Other Woman right at this moment."
- |
  

- We're not sure how he'll react; we're going in blind here.
- |
  

- A bald, muscled  BODYGUARD  kicks down the conference-room door.
- |
  

- "HARRY: What is this?"
- "CHARLENE: Oh, don't you know, Mr.  Defrag ?"
- |
  

- Mr.  Operating System ?
- |
  

- Mr.  Hard Drive ?
- "HARRY: Um, those are all terms I use at work, but I don't understand why you're saying them like that, with the word \"Mister\" in front of them."
- "CHARLENE: ( Screaming at  OTHER WOMAN ."
- |
  

- You emotional home-wrecker!
- |
  

- Stay the [ CENSORED ] away from my man!
- |
  

- Fisticuffs and hair-pulling ensue.
- |
  

- "HARRY: Can someone please explain this?"
- |
  

- The  BODYGUARD  grabs  HARRY  and tasers him repeatedly.
- |
  

- EPISODE 2
- Funny Business
- "HOST: Bob couldn't have been more in love with his fianc\xE9e, Christy."
- |
  

- "She was beautiful, intelligent, and devoted\x97or so it seemed."
- |
  

- Recently, Bob had begun to suspect that Christy had been sharing "inside jokes" with another man via e-mail. Through this behavior, Christy was creating a secretive, extramarital joke-intimacy that marginalized Bob's role as her spouse and primary joke-sharer. We tracked Christy's e-mail activity for a week, and, sure enough, there was some emotional hanky-panky going on in cyberspace.
- |
  

- "Fwd: Fwd: Funny Cats!"
- |
  

- Don't delete!
- |
  

- UR gonna love this!
- |
  

- LOL, Christy!
- |
  

- Love the one with spaghetti on his head!
- |
  

- Have a great weekend!
- |
  

- UR too funny .
- |
  

- TGIF!
- "HOST: Our investigation revealed that the situation was even worse than we had originally thought: it turned out that Christy had shared this illicit joke-intimacy with over 30 other individuals, at least half of whom were men."
- |
  

- Bob was none too happy when we told him the news.
- "BOB: She's giving it up emotionally to every [ CENSORED ] guy in town!"
- "HOST: And that brings us here, just outside the home of one Joe Jones, whose hotmail was hot for Christy, indeed."
- |
  

- The  BODYGUARD  kicks down  JOE 's front door.
- |
  

- "JOE: What is this?"
- |
  

- Who  are  you?
- "BOB: Where is Christy?"
- |
  

- Where's my wife?
- "JOE: Christy who?"
- |
  

- Do you mean my wife's friend Christy, who sends the funny kitten-pic e-mails?
- |
  

- The  BODYGUARD  kicks  JOE  in the groin.
- |
  

- "BOB: ( Sobbing, on his knees."
- |
  

- Ohh, baby, where are you?
- |
  

- Why don't you send  me  wacky photos of kittens?
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- I love you, baby.
- "JOE: I don't understand ."
- |
  

- EPISODE 3
- Bedside Manner
- "HOST: Susan and Frank were happily married with three beautiful children."
- |
  

- But one day Susan began to sense that James was going outside the marriage for emotional reassurance.
- |
  

- This is an extreme red flag for any relationship, since emotional reassurance is the very deepest form of intimacy and should be restricted to one opposite-sex person only per lifetime.
- |
  

- The hot, dirty temptation of extramarital emotional reassurance can be very powerful indeed.
- |
  

- Unfortunately, Susan's instincts were dead-on.
- |
  

- "Here's what our surveillance team caught on tape of James's indiscretion:"
- "JAMES: God, this is terrible."
- "OTHER WOMAN: It's going to be all right, James."
- |
  

- Trust me.
- |
  

- I want you to live your life and be happy.
- "JAMES: But what will I do without you?"
- "OTHER WOMAN: James, you're strong."
- |
  

- I know you'll be OK.
- |
  

- SUSAN  watches footage, angrily twists her hair extensions.
- |
  

- "SUSAN: Oh, what will you do without  her , you [ CENSORED ]? You're about to find out!"
- "HOST: We're now gathered outside Room 113 at St."
- |
  

- John's Hospital, where James is rendezvousing with his emotional gal pal.
- |
  

- Let's do this!
- |
  

- The  BODYGUARD  prepares to kick the door open, but a  NURSE  stops him.
- |
  

- "NURSE: No need to kick down the door."
- |
  

- I'm bringing in a morphine drip for the patient.
- |
  

- They enter and find  JAMES  sitting at the bedside of a sick woman.
- |
  

- "HOST: You're busted, James."
- "SUSAN: What do you have to say for yourself?"
- |
  

- Seeking emotional reassurance from this skank?
- "JAMES: Susan, this is my mother."
- |
  

- You know that.
- "SUSAN: Yeah, so?"
- "JAMES: And she's dying."
- "HOST: Well, now we've seen it all, folks."
- |
  

- This isn't just emotional infidelity; it's emotional  incest .
- |
  

- It's a sick, sick world out there.
- |
  

- The  BODYGUARD  maces  JAMES  in the face.
