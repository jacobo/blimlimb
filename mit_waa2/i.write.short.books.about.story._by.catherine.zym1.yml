  EPISODE FIVE: SELF-EXPRESSION
  Let's say I want to write the definitive Buddy Holly
  biography.  And I choose him as my example only because I
  just watched Gary Busey's stellar, pre-cycle-crash portrayal
  of the horn-rimmed legend.  (I could have supposed just as
  easily Jim Morrison, Dennis Wilson, or Ricky Nelson if only
  their biopics had appeared on my television screen instead.)
  I am merely making a point, which is: If I wanted to write the
  real life story of Buddy Holly, I would need to travel to
  Lubbock's Texas Tech University, the keeper of $175,000
  worth of primary source reference materials.  Once there,
  presumably mitted with small white gloves, I would be able
  to gently caress Holly's lyric book complete with
  handwritten lyrics and sketch notes, finger Holly's Fender
  Stratocaster, and maybe even slip my narrow foot into
  Holly's maroon-and-black stage shoe (the University owns
  only one).
  I'd next move on to some secondary source material&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;perhaps
  a surviving Cricket.  I'd also be sure to ask the
  school librarian if Peggy Sue were living anywhere near
  campus.  "Does Ms. Sue," I'd probe,  "shop at the local Pic
  'n' Save?"
  So let me be clear.  There is no Yorba Linda for Ricky
  Martin.
  What I'm saying is I can't march into the Library of
  Congress and ask to see the Menudo diaries.  West Branch,
  Iowa, may have Rose Wilder's collected letters from 1865-1968,
  but they don't have any of Martin's correspondences.
  Besides, Chelsea House doesn't demand that I do this kind of
  legwork anyway.  When I asked how I should research the
  LeAnn Rimes books, my editor replied with a
  matter-of-factness that startled me.
  "Just use the Internet," he suggested.
  So, I must examine Ricky's spotted past using alternative&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;
  some might say unapproved&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;methods of research.   Tonight,
  for example, I will watch the Latin Music Awards in order to
  answer at least one Riddle of the Sphinx: What is Ricky
  doing to/with his hair these days?
  Last week, I hit the mother lode of archival pursuit&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;
  "Behind the Music."  I wasn't expecting much in the way of
  insight.  With the exception of the Shania Twain episode,
  these bio-lites are not very illuminating.  Addictive, yes;
  edifying, no.  But, in the last few minutes of the show,
  Ricky said something that made me sit up and face the music,
  if you will.
  When asked to reveal the "real" Ricky Martin, the "VH1"
  Ricky Martin sat back in his chair, folded his legs up into
  the lotus position, and quietly responded, "I am whatever
  you say I am."
  A stunningly astute revelation, really.  One that recalls
  the contributions of two trenchant social psychologists:
  Erving Goffman and Marshall Mathers.
  Goffman, the author of The Presentation of Self in Everyday
  Life (a glorious and necessary interpretation of human
  behavior as well-rehearsed theater) divides us into
  expressers and impressers.  For Ricky Martin to express
  himself as society's mirror actually says more about his own
  performance.   And in portraying his "self" as up-for-grabs,
  does he give us to understand that he is just the receptacle for our own
  dreams and desires?  Is he nothing without us?  Are we
  impressed?
  I wonder what Goffman would say about my own presentation of
  self.  Would he suggest that, conceptually, my band books
  are really just thinly veiled stories, fables even, of my
  own life's desires?  In expressing myself, for example, as
  the consummate Latino showman, I script my intense love of
  Miami and Puerto Rico along with a passion for performing in
  marabou feathers.  My readers, in turn, get the impression
  that I have supreme social value and at least one more
  Grammy left inside me.
  Eminem, whose latest single eerily unites him with Ricky
  Martin, clearly understands this concept.  Savvy enough, in
  fact, to market himself in triplicate.  When he is content
  to rap, he labels himself Eminem.  When he cops an attitude
  (presumably while rapping), he answers to Slim Shady.  And
  when he is just being a man, he calls himself Marshall
  Mathers.  While Em's antics are all very silly and annoying,
  his act also casts doubts on the "realness" of what is being
  presented.  Goffman would delight in questioning whether
  Eminem was taken in by his own routine or simply deluding
  his audience for the chief purpose of self-interest.  Will
  the real Slim Shady please stand up?
  But all this thinking is fancy foolishness.  There's no way
  Chelsea House would ever let me write a Goffman-laced
  observation of Eminem.  Instead of writing my next biography
  on a challenging and controversial, albeit cartoonish,
  provocateur, I'll probably wind up penning the epic history
  of Freddie Prinze, Jr.  Or worse, Joshua Jackson.  And then
  how will I ever preserve my self?
