- Dear Miss Lonelyhearts,
- I just got married six weeks ago, but I have noticed that my husband's attentions toward me have already cooled.
- |
  

- All he does is stand there on his four wooden legs with a centerpiece in the middle of him.
- |
  

- And when I try to talk to him, he says nothing at all.
- |
  

- It's gotten so that while I'm eating dinner off him I can't even look him in the eyes, if he had eyes.
- |
  

- "I've tried everything\x97polishing him with Pledge, putting in the extra leaf."
- |
  

- I even got him some extra chairs to spice things up.
- |
  

- Still, nothing.
- |
  

- What am I doing wrong?
- Sincerely,
- Lonely in Louisiana
- Dear Lonely,
- I noticed that you mentioned "eating" in your letter. You are probably too fat for anyone to love.
- Best Wishes,
- Miss Lonelyhearts

- Dear Miss Lonelyhearts
- My parents have been married for 50 years, but I recently found out that they are part of an army of genetically altered polar bears planning on taking over the Earth.
- |
  

- Since I found out, I have had trouble trusting anyone, especially if they are a genetically altered polar bear.
- |
  

- Will I ever heal?
- Thanks,
- Distrusting in Detroit
- Dear Distrusting,
- Well, I guess you are just judge and jury for the world.
- |
  

- These are your parents, and if they want to take over the Earth with their mind-boggling, futuristic bear-powers, then I suggest you respect their wishes.
- |
  

- P.S.
- |
  

- You're a jerk.
- Regards,
- Miss Lonelyhearts
- |
  

- Dear Miss Lonelyhearts,
- I am writing to you about my boyfriend.
- |
  

- He is rich, good-looking, and has an adorable German accent.
- |
  

- "There's just one problem: he never takes me out anywhere."
- |
  

- He claims it is because he is an international war criminal, afraid of being apprehended and brought to The Hague.
- |
  

- He claims that he faked his own death years ago and isn't about to blow his cover now.
- |
  

- But I think the real problem is that he doesn't think I'm attractive enough to be seen with.
- |
  

- Any advice?
- Best,
- Self-Conscious in Santiago
- Dear Self-Conscious,
- I can't believe you wrote this letter on stationery with those stupid "Love Is" characters on it. Grow up, and then maybe Hitler will take you out for dinner. Sheesh.
- Warm Thoughts,
- Miss Lonelyhearts
- |
  

- Dear Miss Lonelyhearts,
- I have a confession to make.
- |
  

- Whenever my girlfriend goes to work, I go to my next-door neighbor Rick's house and hang out with him.
- |
  

- Rick understands me in ways that my girlfriend doesn't, and the way I feel around him has me wondering if I might be gay.
- |
  

- We love watching  Desperate Housewives  on his Tivo and, unlike my girlfriend, Tanya, he lets me put a saddle on him and eats sugar cubes right out of my hand!
- |
  

- We haven't "fooled around" yet, but we are definitely having an emotional affair. I tell Rick all of my secrets, and he neighs and whinnies as if he were my best friend. Is it unusual for a 30-year-old guy to have feelings for another man?
- Signed,
- Confused in Colorado
- Dear Confused,
- If you like  Desperate Housewives  you are definitely gay.
- |
  

- "Also, why did you put quotes around \"fooled around\"? Were you actually quoting someone? May I suggest you get two things:"
- |
  

- A  Chicago Manual of Style
- |
  

- A life.
