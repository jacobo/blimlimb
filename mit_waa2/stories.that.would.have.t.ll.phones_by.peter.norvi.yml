- Hi, it's Patsy.
- I went out walkin'
- After midnight
- Out in the moonlight
- Just like we used to do.
- I'm always walkin'
- After midnight
- Searchin' for you.
- Yeah .
- |
  

- Uh-huh .
- |
  

- OK, I'll meet you there.
- Bye.
- |
  

- "ESTRAGON: You're sure it was this evening?"
- "VLADIMIR: What?"
- "ESTRAGON: That we were to wait."
- "VLADIMIR: He said Saturday."
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- I think.
- "ESTRAGON: You think."
- "VLADIMIR: I must have made a note of it."
- |
  

- He fumbles in his pockets, which are bursting with miscellaneous rubbish.
- |
  

- What'll we do?
- |
  

- Beeping sound as  ESTRAGON  dials number.
- |
  

- "VOICE OF RECORDING ON PHONE: You've reached the number for Mr. Godot."
- |
  

- Mr. Godot told me to tell you he won't come this evening but surely will tomorrow.
- "ESTRAGON: Well, shall we go?"
- "VLADIMIR: Yes, let's go."
- |
  

- "ROMEO:"
- News from Verona!
- |
  

- How now, Balthasar?
- Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
- How doth my lady?
- |
  

- Is my father well?
- How fares my Juliet?
- |
  

- That I ask again,
- For nothing can be ill if she be well.
- "BALTHASAR:"
- Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
- Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
- And her immortal part with angels lives.
- I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
- And presently took post to tell it you.
- O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
- Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
- "ROMEO:"
- Is it e'en so?
- |
  

- Then I defy you, stars!
- But soft!
- |
  

- What SMS through yonder RAZR breaks?
- "SMS ON ROMEO'S PHONE:"
- |
