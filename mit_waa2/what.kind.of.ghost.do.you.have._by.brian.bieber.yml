  CLUMSY GHOST
  You are always mindful to keep delicate objects away from the edges of coffee tables and countertops, lest they fall mysteriously to the floor. You hear strange, disembodied voices in the attic. They say, "whoops!"
  You have a clumsy ghost.
  Your home's previous owner died a tragic but avoidable and seemingly far-fetched death:
  "Why was this beautiful home so inexpensive?"
  "The real estate agent said something about a loose floorboard, and a candelabrum, and the previous owner's stereo not being grounded right."
  This is a typical conversation in a house with a clumsy ghost.
  SICK GHOST
  Your husband is working the late shift. Your children are asleep in their bedrooms down the hall. So where is that soft, spectral sniffling coming from? 
  You find yourself woken in the night by the sound of a phlegmy cough, followed by an embarrassed and spooky "Excuse me." You have a sick ghost.
  You go through more Kleenex than seems possible for a mortal family of four. You've already punished your screw-up fourteen-year-old son twice for drinking all the 
  Robitussin while everyone is asleep. Only after you've sent Brad to detox and the cough syrup disappearances continue does it occur to you that the answer to this mystery 
  can only be found beyond the grave... and under the weather.
  GHOST WITH A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR
