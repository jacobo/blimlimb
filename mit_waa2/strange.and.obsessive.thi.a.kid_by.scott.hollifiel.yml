- "Age 9:"
- Developed a fascination with TV Guide, specifically the listings.

- Spent hours copying them onto loose-leaf notebook paper &#151; just the titles of shows, not descriptions, and with the times bumped up several hours to make it more interesting.
- "Age 11:"
- Co-invented, with a friend, a new board game based on The Empire Strikes Back, which had just come out.

- The game was played on a traditional checkerboard, but with chess pieces.

- It was adapted from The Empire Strikes Back solely in that the pieces were referred to as various types of spaceships and droids.

- The actual rules were quite simple, and some games lasted hours.

- Eventually, we taught several other friends how to play, and held an informal tournament.

- I came in second place.
- "Age 7:"
- Was an avid dictionary and encyclopedia fan.

- In particular, my obsession was the 1957 set of  World Book Encyclopedias that belonged to my grandparents.
- |
  

- I lingered primarily over anachronistic detail, such as the territorial status of Alaska and Hawaii.
- |
  

- The article on space travel was my favorite single article.
- |
  

- Its artistic depictions seemed to indicate that mankind would fly around outer space in one-man capsules with glass cockpits, which warped my impressions of space travel for years to come.
- |
  

- My favorite volume was the "F" volume &#151; for the article on "flags," which showed a picture of every flag in the world.
- |
  

- I was totally bewildered by a photo in the article on "candy."  It was a black-and-white photo of a candy factory, and suffered from an optical effect that made it appear as if a human being were actually part of the machinery.
- "Age 9:"
- Learned how to play the Japanese game "shogi," which is chess-like but more complicated.  I never played a single game, but once used my arcane knowledge of it to show off to a classmate, an incident of which I remain deeply ashamed to this very day.
- "Age 10:"
- Made up my own superheroes and comic books, as many young comic book fans do.
- |
  

- I didn't stop there, however, and went on to create my own imaginary comic book company, complete with a unifying corporate design and advertising campaigns, mimicking the business models of Marvel and DC Comics.
- "Age 8:"
- Learned how the Roman numeral system worked.
- |
  

- Subsequently filled a notebook by writing every Roman numeral, in order, from I (one) to MMM (three thousand).
- "Age 4:"
- Owned a magnetic board with a matching set of multi-colored letters of the alphabet.
- |
  

- Storage conditions for the letters, dictated by me, required that they be arranged &#151; yes &#151; in alphabetical order, in a perfect 5-by-5 grid, with Z being remaindered to the side compartment.
- |
  

- I would only retire to bed once these storage conditions were met, for a period of some months.
- |
  

- During active play, I would make abstract patterns on the board with the letters; never actual words.
