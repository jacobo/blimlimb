- A COLONIAL GIRL
- It's 1774 and I am learning penmanship at Miss Manderly's school.

- I hope you find my quill scribblings legible, as I have a serious question about the inevitable War of Independence.
- |
  

- The Patriots say we must fight in order to have a democratically elected leader, privacy rights, and freedom of speech.
- |
  

- Yet I understand that you, along with Messrs.

- Cheney and Rumsfeld, are dismantling these very things.
- |
  

- This vexes me.
- |
  

- "When I am riding my realistically rendered chestnut mare, Penny, or sitting in my scaled-down Windsor writing chair, I ask: Why must our fittest young men die if the Revolution will prove meaningless?"
- |
  

- If you will make yourself king, should we not avoid the bloodshed altogether?
- |
  

- Please write back to me at Merriman Farm, the Commonwealth of Virginia.

- Lives are at stake.
- Samantha
- A VICTORIAN GIRL
- Congratulations on a splendid job!

- I live with Grandmother in 1904 in a New York City mansion, where we enjoy the great rewards of our industrial economy.
- |
  

- The other day, as we were riding through Central Park in our historically accurate sleigh, I was looking at my period-perfect stereoscope pictures and feeling sad that my friend Nellie will remain in the servant class for the rest of her life.
- |
  

- Then Grandmother remarked that it is the strict societal divisions favoring the fortunate few that allow me to have things like my crystal lemonade set, which comes complete with a Battenberg-lace-edged tablecloth.
- |
  

- It made me grateful that you are bringing back the economic divide that allows little girls like me to be so exceedingly happy!
- |
  

- Please come to tea.
- |
  

- We live in the white house with gold griffins on either side of the front door.
- |
  

- Nellie will be outside with a scrub bucket, polishing them.
- Kit
- A DEPRESSION-ERA GIRL
- I apologize for the lack of proper stationery, but we're too poor to buy any right now, and I have only the back of a fruit-crate label on which to write.
- |
  

- I stole the crate, with the help of my friends, and made it into a scooter, one of my favorite accessories.
- |
  

- When we're hungry or impoverished, we children find it easy to break the law, and may grow up to be criminals.
- |
  

- I wonder if you ever consider that when it comes to Iraqi orphans, those underserved by the U.S.
- |
  

- Since Daddy lost his business, I'm wishing that my array of accessories included a Molotov cocktail.
- |
  

- Do not bother to write back, as we will probably lose our house to the bank very soon.
- |
  

- I will miss the rose bushes Mother planted in happier times.
- Kaya
- A NATIVE AMERICAN GIRL
- I belong to one of the aboriginal peoples of North America, the Nez Perce.

- The name is a misnomer, bestowed by the French, and means "pierced nose.
- "\" I would venture that the one thing you and I have in common is that neither of us likes the French!"
- |
  

- I think we differ on everything else.
- |
  

- Sometimes when I am doing my crafts, I ask, "
- Why has no one stopped Mr. Bush?
- "\" But then I think, \""
- Why did no one stop the Europeans from sweeping across the Pacific Northwest and destroying our way of life?
- "\" I want to ride to Washington, D.C."

- Appaloosa mare, Steps High, warning people against your tolerance for increased eminent domain.
- |
  

- But Steps is the size of a kitten, and I'm afraid the two of us would get run over by an SUV as soon as we got out of the cul-de-sac in our Phoenix subdivision.

- If you want to write to me, remember that my people are nomadic, so you'll have to employ a very good tracker to find our tepee.

  I belong to one of the aboriginal peoples of North America, the Nez Perce.
