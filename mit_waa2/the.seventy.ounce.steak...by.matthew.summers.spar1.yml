- John Laslo is a manager at the Hard Times Restaurant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, home of the seventy-ounce steak challenge.
- |
  

- "Q: What is the seventy-ounce steak challenge?"
- "John Laslo: If you can eat a seventy-ounce steak, a baked potato, the daily vegetable, and a slice of cheesecake in one hour, it's free."
- |
  

- If you can't eat it all, it's $49.
- |
  

- "Q: What does a seventy-ounce steak look like?"
- "Laslo: It's oval-shaped."
- |
  

- It's a top sirloin.
- |
  

- It's probably about two-and-a-half inches thick, and it's about fifteen to eighteen inches tip-to-tip.
- "Q: How many people have taken the challenge?"
- "Laslo: Well, it's not really well documented, but I'd say over the five to six years we've run the challenge, somewhere between 210 and 220."
- "Q: What percentage have been men, what percentage have been women?"
- "Laslo: Ninety-nine percent men."
- |
  

- There have been just a few women.
- |
  

- One time, a guy surprised his girlfriend with the challenge.
- |
  

- When they got to the restaurant, he told her that he'd already ordered their dinner.
- |
  

- So they sat down, and we brought out the seventy-ounce steak.
- |
  

- It was about as big as her.
- |
  

- She had about two bites of it and was done.
- |
  

- The guy thought it was hilarious.
- "Q: What did she think?"
- "Laslo: She thought it was funny, she had a laugh."
- "Q: What did you think?"
- "Laslo: I thought, \"Knock yourself out, pal."
- "Q: How does one find out about the seventy-ounce steak challenge?"
- "Laslo: There's mention in several of our ads that appear in hotel rooms around Niagara Falls."
- |
  

- If I'm not mistaken, it's in the CAA and AAA guide books.
- |
  

- There's some other ads that are distributed on the streets around the area.
- "Q: So someone sees the ad, and then what?"
- "Laslo: It asks you to call for details."
- |
  

- We get at least four to five calls a day.
- |
  

- In some of the ads we say, "Call and ask about our free steak dinner.
- "\" A lot of people will hear about what they have to do for the free dinner and go, \""
- Yeah, right," then hang up.
- |
  

- If they decide to take it, we let them know that we need to get about four hours lead time to prepare the steak, especially this time of year [winter].
- |
  

- The steaks are frozen and need time to thaw.
- "Q: How do you serve a steak challenge?"
- "Laslo: We serve everything but the cheesecake at the same time."
- |
  

- The steak, baked potato and vegetable are served on a tray that's actually pretty cool.
- |
  

- It's in the shape of a cow, with a pewter head and a pewter tail end.
- "Q: How many steak challenges have you served?"
- "Laslo: Not too many."
- |
  

- I did a lot of them at the beginning of the challenge, maybe a dozen or so, but I haven't done a lot recently because I don't work the floor any more.
- |
  

- I did the very first one.
- "Q: Who took the very first steak challenge?"
- "Laslo: I met the fellow twice."
- |
  

- The first time, it was he and another gentleman, and they both took the challenge.
- |
  

- The fellow's friend was a loud guy who said, "Oh, keep the food coming, I can eat it!
- |
  

- I can eat it!
- "\" He dug in for about twenty minutes then waved the white flag."
- |
  

- The guy who finished the steak never said a word.
- |
  

- He just went through the challenge like a hot knife through butter.
- |
  

- He finished the whole thing in like thirty-eight, thirty-nine minutes.
- "Q: Wow."
- |
  

- What did he look like?
- "Laslo: He was about 5' 11\", he might've weighed a couple hundred pounds."
- |
  

- He wasn't huge &#151; I've seen bigger &#151; but he had tremendous rhythm.
- "Q: What do you mean by rhythm?"
- "Laslo: He was like a metronome: cut."
- |
  

- He never changed his rhythm and he just went right through it.
- |
  

- His buddy was stuffing his face with the potato and the vegetable, and he just went too fast.
- |
  

- He couldn't finish half of the steak.
- "Q: So is rhythm the trick to finishing the challenge?"
- "Laslo: Absolutely."
- |
  

- I don't care how big you are, or how much you can put away, if you don't have a certain rhythm, chances are you won't make it.
- |
  

- It's just too much food.
- |
  

- Most of the time, when someone sees the size of the steak and everything else with it, they just panic.
- |
  

- They shovel it in and then they're full.
- |
  

- The trick is to just go at a nice steady pace and take bites as you normally would.
- |
  

- You know, an hour's a long time.
- "Q: So, with the pacing, it's somewhat like, say, running a marathon?"
- "Laslo: Right, except there's no burst of energy at the end."
- "Q: How many people have successfully completed the meal?"
- "Laslo: Under twenty."
- "Q: Are they all men?"
- "Laslo: Yes."
- "Q: Besides the knack for rhythm, are there any other common qualities to these men?"
- "Laslo: Not really."
- |
  

- They've been different sizes, different shapes, from different parts of the country.
- |
  

- There doesn't seem to be a pattern other than being able to maintain a nice pace.
- |
  

- I mean, someone my size probably couldn't do it.
- "Q: What size are you?"
- "Laslo: I'm about 5' 10\", I go about 175 &#151; average, average, you know."
- "Q: Have you ever been tempted to take the challenge?"
- "Laslo: No, never."
- "Q: Why not?"
- "Laslo: It's out of my league."
- |
  

- See, someone who has never experienced this, even a day or two before trying it, they don't comprehend just how much food this is.
- |
  

- Maybe they have a picture in their head, but the challenge still seems like a crazy, fun thing to do.
- |
  

- But I've seen 200 of them.
- |
  

- Bearing that in mind, it holds no fascination for me on a personal level.
- "Q: What is the eater like when he finishes the meal?"
- "Laslo: They're usually calm."
- |
  

- They're not elated, jumping up and down, screaming, "I did it!
- |
  

- I did it!
- "\" It's more of a shrug and, \""
- I knew I could do it.
- "\" For instance, the first guy who did it, he just calmly finished."
- |
  

- He and his buddy paid their bill and then he shook hands with all of us.
- |
  

- Then about an hour and a half later, he stuck his head back in the door and said, "
- I'll bet you $100 I can do that again.
- "Q: What did you say?"
- "Laslo: Actually, he was talking to my boss, Rick."
- |
  

- Rick was mockingly terrified that the first guy ever to try it actually did it, so he jokingly said to the guy, "Get the hell out of here.
- |
  

- You're killing us over here.
- "\" They had a good chuckle about it."
- "Q: You mentioned earlier that you met that guy twice."
- "Laslo: Right."
- |
  

- He came back, but he had just a regular meal.
