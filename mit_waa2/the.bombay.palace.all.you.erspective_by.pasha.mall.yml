- Chicken Tikka
- This classic starter makes its predictable appearance at the head of the buffet table, toned down, conforming to limited Western tolerances of "spiciness.
- "\" Tikka is the ultimate semi-exoticized Other: a universally common foodstuff (chicken) transmogrified into something sufficiently foreign (tikka), satiating the colonial palate while not overwhelming it."

- Indian food at its most tepid and obsequious.

- Veggie Samosa
- A decidedly light-brown crust suggests the hierarchies of caste &#8212; the darker, burnt samosas surely having been discarded.

- "Here is the Colonial Gaze in action: the samosas are looked upon but never afforded the opportunity to look back, effectively evaluated according to Western standards of \"goodness."
- "\" The dipping of these things into ketchup is particularly revolting."

- Lamb Curry
- "A classic example of hybridity from the Contact Zone: a traditional, North Indian meat, suppressed by the dominant power structure, and subsequently anglicized by an absurd chutney-based sauce."

- Honor Gandhi &#8212; or, to a lesser extent, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi &#8212; and starve yourself rather than dine on this filth.

- Butter Chicken
- Stripped of its proper Hindi name, "Butter Chicken" is a classic example of lingual control, subjugation and cultural displacement. Refer to this only as Murg Makhani. Rail against colonial oppression.

- Mattar Paneer
- Conversely, here the co-opting of Hindi supplants the native voice.
- |
  

- Robbed of their own language, the colonized people allow themselves to be defined by Western terms, furthering their plight as disenfranchised victims.

- Call this Peas and Cheese, and eat it with a nice steak.

- With Krishna as my witness, I swear we will not be pinned under the heel of imperialism any longer.

- Rice
- "The act of eating rice, for the colonizer, is one of appropriation: (s)he is effectively consuming h(er)/[is] own approximation of Indian identity."
- |
  

- The mere inclusion of rice is a laughable attempt at reinforcing South Asian stereotypes.
- |
  

- And thusly I laugh at you, bastard colonial oppressors!

- Ha!
- |
  

- Ha!

- The Buffet as Orientalist Discourse
- Consider the buffet itself as an extension of that tragic scene in  The Temple of Doom  in which a horde of turbaned Indians are depicted as barbarians, feasting on monkey brains.

- They are once again mocking us, my glorious brown brethren.
- |
  

- "But fear not: triumph is at hand."

- Pity the white man for his ignorance &#8212; then, when he's going up for seconds, smack him in the kidneys with a cricket bat!
