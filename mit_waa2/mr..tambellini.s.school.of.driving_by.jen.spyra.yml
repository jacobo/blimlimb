- Because of the shameful training I received at Mr. Tambellini's School of Driving, I didn't manage to pass the driving test until my fourth go, and then I got my dead grandma's Camry.

- "She employs a primitive style of child rearing, though (classic example: teaching a curious youngster about the dangers of fire by allowing him to jump through a large bonfire, then refusing plastic surgery to minimize the massive scarring, for fear of encouraging self-love), so I think that choosing Mr. Tambellini's program was just another way for her to express her special parenting method."
- Every Tuesday, I'd meet Mr. Tambellini in his basement apartment for an hour of training, then we'd go out for three hours of driving.

- Based on what I've heard from my friends, typical driver's-ed instruction consists of lectures and videos.
