- "Q: What made you decide to work on the Morgan horse farm?"
- "Dickson: I wanted to get away from everything."
- |
  

- I wanted to be on my own.
- |
  

- I just turned twenty and had only experienced high school.
- "Q: So you didn't go away to college?"
- "Dickson: No, and I wanted to experience something I couldn't in Michigan."
- "Q: How did you hear about the job?"
- "Dickson: I had a friend I rode the bus with in sixth grade."
- |
  

- He worked with his grandparents who were in the horse show business.
- |
  

- I always helped them out because I was fascinated by horses.
- |
  

- He called and told me a farm higher up in the business wanted an extra horse groomer.
- |
  

- The farm made a lot of money and offered free room and board, with a small hourly wage.
- |
  

- They only needed someone for three months over the summer until World Championships.
- |
  

- It was perfect for me because I could start back up my local college in the fall and I really wanted to learn more about horses.
- "Q: So, what was your typical day like?"
- "Dickson: I'd wake up at 6:30 a.m."
- |
  

- I had to clean the stalls, feed the horses, groom the horses, and put on the equipment they needed for the day.
- |
  

- There would be a list hanging on the wall that explained the workout each horse was getting and the equipment I needed to use depending on the horse's temper the past few days.
- |
  

- I always liked the grooming part and developed my theory on how to do it.
- "Q: What do you mean?"
- "Dickson: Well, Morgan horses are very high strung because they're over-bred."
- |
  

- I learned that I could gain trust if I started by brushing the foretop.
- |
  

- It's the very front part of the mane.
- |
  

- My theory is they couldn't brush their own mane or see a mirror.
- |
  

- They could feel it being combed&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;it was mental and physical.
- |
  

- They liked the feeling that you were taking care of something they couldn't see but could feel.
- |
  

- It made the horses trust you more and put them at ease.
- |
  

- Anyway, after I did all the basic grooming, feeding, and cleaning, I'd wait until the horses were worked and I'd do all the put away stuff.
- "Q: How long were your days?"
- "Dickson: That's the thing."
- |
  

- It was like third-world labor.
- |
  

- I worked about fourteen hours a day and made $3 an hour under the table.
- |
  

- Most of the people doing the work were really young or illegal immigrants.
- |
  

- We weren't paid shit for doing a shitload of work.
- |
  

- That's how they make their money.
- |
  

- Ralph Nader would have a field day with the horse show business.
- |
  

- It's real corrupt.
- |
  

- But the people I worked for were amazing, brilliant, quick thinking.
- |
  

- It's a cutthroat business.
- |
  

- They survived because of smarts and family.
- |
  

- It's a family-run business.
- |
  

- The owners' strengths were that their beliefs were intact.
- |
  

- Also, they didn't care about what anyone thought of them.
- |
  

- Very on the ball.
- "Q: So they had an impact on you?"
- "Dickson: They had a moral impact and work ethic impact."
- |
  

- They were very big on individual growth.
- |
  

- They definitely had a religious impact.
- |
  

- They were devout Catholics.
- "Q: Did you have a problem with the way you were treated as a laborer versus their religious beliefs?"
- "Dickson: Yes, I never did say I liked those guys."
- "Q: Did you have any time for fun?"
- "Dickson: Work first fun second."
- |
  

- Work before play.
- |
  

- From 4 or 6 p.m.
- |
  

- It was like a family because I was expected to do all my work.
- |
  

- But I wasn't treated like a regular family member.
- |
  

- I wasn't treated as well.
- "Q: What did you do for fun?"
- "Dickson: A lot of people smoked weed."
- |
  

- Some people would scam out of the vet's tranquilizers he injected into the horses.
- |
  

- They wouldn't take the whole bottle.
- |
  

- Other than that we would go to Wal-Mart for the hell of it.
- "Q: Would you do it again?"
- "Dickson: No, it wouldn't be the same going through it the second time."
- "Q: Why not?"
- "Dickson: The novelty of working with the horses would wear off."
- |
  

- The first time feeling would be gone.
- |
  

- The negatives would stand out more.
- |
  

- It would be like taking a step back because working with horses isn't a part of my future plans.
- "Q: So you did it just to try it and now you're done?"
- "Dickson: Basically I did it to kill time, make money and learn something new."
- |
  

- That's about it.
- "Q: Are you glad you did it?"
- "Dickson: Yes."
- |
  

- I'm not big on regret and I think anything you do you walk away better for it.

  Q: What made you decide to work on the Morgan horse farm?
  Dickson: I wanted to get away from everything. I wanted to be on my own. I just turned twenty and had only experienced high school.
  Q: So you didn't go away to college?
  Dickson: No, and I wanted to experience something I couldn't in Michigan.
  Q: How did you hear about the job?
  Dickson: I had a friend I rode the bus with in sixth grade. He worked with his grandparents who were in the horse show business. I always helped them out because I was fascinated by horses. He called and told me a farm higher up in the business wanted an extra horse groomer. The farm made a lot of money and offered free room and board, with a small hourly wage. They only needed someone for three months over the summer until World Championships. It was perfect for me because I could start back up my local college in the fall and I really wanted to learn more about horses.
  Q: So, what was your typical day like?
  Dickson: I'd wake up at 6:30 a.m., go to the barn and start working. I had to clean the stalls, feed the horses, groom the horses, and put on the equipment they needed for the day. There would be a list hanging on the wall that explained the workout each horse was getting and the equipment I needed to use depending on the horse's temper the past few days. I always liked the grooming part and developed my theory on how to do it.
  Q: What do you mean?
  Dickson: Well, Morgan horses are very high strung because they're over-bred. I learned that I could gain trust if I started by brushing the foretop. It's the very front part of the mane.

  Q: Did you have a problem with the way you were treated as a laborer versus their religious beliefs?
  Dickson: Yes, I never did say I liked those guys.
  Q: Did you have any time for fun?
  Dickson: Work first fun second. Work before play. From 4 or 6 p.m. until bed was when we had fun. It was like a family because I was expected to do all my work... to contribute... more than a regular job. But I wasn't treated like a regular family member. I wasn't treated as well.
  Q: What did you do for fun?
  Dickson: A lot of people smoked weed. Some people would scam out of the vet's tranquilizers he injected into the horses. They wouldn't take the whole bottle... just pull a little out the top with a syringe so nobody caught on. Other than that we would go to Wal-Mart for the hell of it.
  Q: Would you do it again?
  Dickson: No, it wouldn't be the same going through it the second time.
  Q: Why not?
  Dickson: The novelty of working with the horses would wear off. The first time feeling would be gone. The negatives would stand out more. It would be like taking a step back because working with horses isn't a part of my future plans.
  Q: So you did it just to try it and now you're done?
  Dickson: Basically I did it to kill time, make money and learn something new. That's about it.
  Q: Are you glad you did it?
  Dickson: Yes. I'm not big on regret and I think anything you do you walk away better for it... no matter what kind of hell you go through and no matter how ignorant you feel while you're doing it.
