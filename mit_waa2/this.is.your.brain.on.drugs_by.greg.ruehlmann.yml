- Jeff Huber's coed middle-school party.
- There's pingpong downstairs, and upstairs it's that card game, the one with the spoons.
- |
  

- On the table, Jeff's mom has laid out a solid spread of chocolate-chip cookies, Doritos, and 12 bottles of Crystal Pepsi.
- |
  

- You're making quite an impression with that new Starter jacket of yours.
- When TGIF comes on TV, all your friends run into the family room.
- |
  

- Hey, check out Urkel!
- |
  

- Look how he's wearing his pants!
- Then you realize you haven't seen your brain for 20 minutes.
- Suddenly, the screen door opens, and your brain stumbles into the room, completely reeking of pot.
- "\"What's up, guys?"
- "\" it asks."
- |
  

- Your brain turns the Doritos bag upside down over its mouth, then curls up in the corner and giggles to itself like an asshole for an hour.
- The only one high at the party.
- |
  

- Not cool, brain.
- |
  

- Not cool.
- Junior year of high school.
- |
  

- Midterm week.
- You and your brain head back to your locker after an intense morning spent studying for the calculus test.
- In the locker, under some gym shorts, you notice a baggie.
- "\"Speed pills?"
- "\" you ask your brain, holding the bag in front of your lifelong best friend."
- |
  

- "\"These won't help you study!"
- |
  

- Where did you get them?
- |
  

- WHERE DID YOU GET THEM?
- Your brain's clearly nervous.
- |
  

- And strung out on uppers.
- |
  

- Its gray matter blushes as it stammers, saying, "Those ain't mine.
- "Canc\xFAn."
- |
  

- College spring break, 2001.
- "At Se\xF1or Frog's, everyone's drinking margaritas on the cheap and moving to the techno music."
- |
  

- People have formed a circle around your brain, which is twirling glow sticks with its cerebellum, dancing crazily, and flashing anyone with 10 pesos and a camera.
- |
  

- It doesn't bother you much that your brain's on Ecstasy.
- |
  

- At least, not until later, when it starts gyrating dangerously close, and then totally tries to make out with you!
- |
  

- Gross!
- There's a lot of awkwardness for the rest of the school year.
- Two weeks ago.
- |
  

- Evening time in your apartment.
- You're relaxing after work, decompressing from a full and stressful day.
- You turn on the TV, but your favorite show is a rerun tonight.
- |
  

- So you surf the channels, sipping a beer in a Koozie.
- You stop on an episode of  Cops  on the local UPN.
- |
  

- You can hear cursing offscreen, while police officers accuse somebody of crack possession.
- |
  

- There's a chase, with five angry patrolmen running after the suspect.
- |
  

- "Wait\x97who is that fleeing?"
- |
  

- Even though the camera's shaky, you recognize the cerebral cortex immediately.
- |
  

- You'd recognize it anywhere.
- |
  

- It's your brain on the run again!
- |
  

- You sigh.
- When they catch and cuff your brain, the jerk even tries to bust in the cop-car window.
- |
  

- It looks like it hasn't bathed in days, and with all the profanity .
- |
  

- Twenty years from now.
- It's your night to cook.
- |
  

- You're whipping up a sensible and health-conscious low-carb dinner for you and your brain to enjoy in your elegant home.
- You hear weird sounds from the basement.
- |
  

- You head down the stairs, and there you find your brain sitting in a music studio, putting the finishing touches on a masterful piece of mind-blowing psychedelic rock!
- When did your brain learn to make concept albums?
- |
  

- Where did it get the studio equipment?
- |
  

- And where did that burnt-out reefer on the coffee table come from?
- Without thinking, you just lay into your brain.
- |
  

- "\"You said you were through with this stuff years ago!"
- |
  

- You promised!
- The brain begins to weep.
- |
  

- Through fits of sobbing, it tries to speak to you.
- |
  

- "\"I swear it's just for my glaucoma,\""
- |
  

- "\"Check out this 12-minute sitar solo."
- You have no idea how to respond to this.
