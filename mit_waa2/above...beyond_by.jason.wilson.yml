  For years, consumers only considered an aboveground pool as a low cost
  alternative in the leisure pool market.
  "Aboveground pools have been around a long time, but there are some
  misconceptions," says John Butterfield, corportate communications
  manager
  for Doughboy Recreation in Rancho Cucamonga, CA. "There's the
  perception
  
  that an aboveground is 'that white tank in the backyard,' or a
  perception
  that they're just toys."
  "But it is a 'real' pool," Butterfield says.
  So real is the aboveground pool that it has enjoyed a tremendous
  resurgence in popularity, say industry experts.
  Suddenly, the aboveground pool has become fashionable. More and more
  people are turning to what was once considered only a cheap alternative
  to inground pools.
  Among new pool purchases, aboveground pools out-number inground pools
  nearly three to one. There are now over 3.2 million aboveground pool
  owners in the United States, only slightly behind the 3.3 million
  inground pool owners.
  There are several reasons for the shift in pool buying. The most
  obvious
  
  reason is that the average family just doesn't have the same
  discretionary income that it did in the past, industry experts say.
  The aboveground pool market is the strongest in colder regions of the
  country, such as the northeast and the midwest, where people are only
  swimming for about 90 days out of the year. "For certain climates, you
  have a limited season, so doesn't an aboveground pool make sense?" asks
  Butterfield.
  Helene Bukenas, from West Deptford, New Jersey, bought an aboveground
  pool for her family two years ago. The reason for the choice was simple
  economics. "It was cheaper. That's the main and only reason," she says.
  "An inground pool is more expensive to install and maintain."
  
  Bukenas shopped around and chose a 34-foot oval pool that was 5 feet
  deep. The model cost $4,000 and she claims a comparable inground pool
  would have cost $20,000.
  As the popularity of inground pools soars, it is important for families
  to understand what they are buying. Families need to take a number of
  factors into account, such as the size of the yard, how many people
  will
  
  be using the pool, how many years a family intends to use the pool and,
  of course, price.
  Once a family determines what size pool they need, they should shop
  around to ensure they are getting the best pool for the best price.
  Aboveground pools have a wide range of prices, from under $1,000 to
  over
  
  $12,000, complete with a myriad of "deluxe" options. Inexpensive
  aboveground pools that only last a year or two can be purchased at
  discount stores, but the average kit costs $2,500 to $3,000.
  A regional sales manager with one company in the industry says his
  compay
  sells its top-of-the-kine aboveground pool for around $12,000. It is
  loaded with options normally associated with inground models, including
  a
  deck or walk-around, automatic pool cleaners, quality ladders, a
  high-quality pump and filter system and winter or solar cover. The
  company calls it a "turn-key" system.
  Aboveground pools are constructed from aluminum, steel, and polymer
  resin. They're all quality pools and they're not going to fall down,
  but

  Aluminum pools have traditionally stood at the higher end because they
  are more corrosion-resistant. Steel is more apt to rust, but the metal
  industry over the past ten years has made high quality steel coatings.
  The edge that aluminum pools once had is decreasing, the designer says.
  Resin pools have been developed over the past ten years as well. There
  is
