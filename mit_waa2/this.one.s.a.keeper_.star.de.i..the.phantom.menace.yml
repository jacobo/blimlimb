- Although this episode is somewhat removed from the central story, Lucas is able to tie it in later and demonstrate its impact on Anakin's development through a series of flashbacks.
- Following his adventures with the thieves, Anakin returns to school where he is stalked by a band of Imperial schoolyard ruffians (led by a buffed-up Joaquin Phoenix,  Space Camp,   8mm ), who torment the diminutive youth.

- The plucky Anakin tries to defend himself, but is outmatched by the bullies and is nearly beaten before being rescued by a brash young Jedi warrior named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor,  Trainspotting ).  The two become fast friends and Obi-Wan begins to train Anakin in the ways of the Force.

- When the Empire threatens Tatooine, Obi-Wan is forced to flee the planet and invites Anakin  to join him.

- In an especially touching moment, Anakin is forced to choose between his friend Obi-Wan and his beloved pony.
- |
  

- Anakin follows Obi-Wan and the two begin a mentor/mentee relationship that becomes the nucleus around which the film's story and characters revolve.
- Once Anakin and Obi-Wan leave Tatooine, the story rockets ahead at a truly dizzying pace.
- |
  

- In an attempt to throw the Empire off their track, Obi-Wan disguises himself as an elderly Pakistani woman and the two set off for the Rebel camp.
- |
  

- Once there, the film begins an uninterrupted rush toward a thrilling and occasionally violent climax.
- On so many levels, "Menace" is an unqualified success.  Although at times visually derivative of the 1994 James Spader classic  Stargate ,  Menace  is a sci-fi standout.  The special effects are believable, but not overpowering, and the action sequences are absolutely electrifying.  Lucas demonstrates a mastery of the genre by combining sentiment and sensation in an almost seamless, imaginative whole. Outstanding supporting performances, including Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn and Dana Plato as Janet, together with a  story that is emotionally compelling, without resorting to unnecessary pathos, make this one of the most satisfying sci-fi films in years.
