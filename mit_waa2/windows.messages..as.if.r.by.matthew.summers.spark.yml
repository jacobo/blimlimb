- Hello, Matt.
- |
  

- It's Scott.
- |
  

- Now that we're adults, what do you say we meet for lunch?
- |
  

- A little bistro just opened near my office; they serve excellent sandwiches.
- |
  

- Let's catch up!
- |
  

- I have some news to discuss with you concerning how you stink and your mom thinks you're dumb.

- "Original Windows message:"
- Are you sure you want to exit Windows?
- "Scott's revised message:"
- Remember how it seemed as if I was always outside, waiting for you after school?
- |
  

- Well, I wasn't; it was a trick.
- |
  

- Some days, I was happy knowing that you were terrified of me waiting outside, ready to lunge at you from behind the dumpster.
- |
  

- "I feel that I can now tell you that I had other obligations at the time: I had to bully five other kids."
- |
  

- I didn't realize it then, but I was an expert at time management by the age of seven.
- |
  

- Today, I'm even better at time management.
- |
  

- I have managed to schedule time every day, from 5:00 through 5:20, to devote to my favorite hobby, bullying.
- |
  

- You get off work at 5:00, right?
- |
  

- Perfect.
- |
  

- I'm sure you still stink, but do you still wear that stupid purple jacket?
- |
  

- Come outside!
- |
  

- Exit Windows!
- |
  

- I'm waiting, dork.
