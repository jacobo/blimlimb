- Dan, Cheryl, and Clare were all vegetarians once but not anymore.
- |
  

- We were having a barbecue.
- |
  

- Dan and I were standing by the grill while Cheryl and my wife, Clare, were up on the patio, talking.
- "\"The only thing that makes me sad about veal is when it's overcooked,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- I was trying hard to be funny.
- Dan chuckled, though I didn't believe him.
- |
  

- "\"This isn't veal you're grilling,\""
- |
  

- "\"Tell me it isn't."
- "I didn't answer but went on: \"Those poor baby cows suffered."
- |
  

- On a certain level, it's the moral responsibility of the cook to make sure they're delicious.
- |
  

- That's why overcooking veal is such a crime.
- "\"I guess I can see that,\""
- |
  

- Dan.
- |
  

- I was half certain he was fucking my wife.
- |
  

- We were all alcoholics.
- "\"Come down from the patio,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"The meat is almost ready."
- "\" The women finished talking and came down to meet us."
- "\"Hey, beautiful,\""
- |
  

- Dan said to Cheryl.
- |
  

- "\"What were you talking about?"
- "\" I knew what he was worried they were talking about."
- |
  

- I asked if anyone wanted a drink.
- |
  

- Everyone did.
- |
  

- I gave Cheryl her drink first.
- |
  

- She touched the backs of my fingers when I handed her the can of beer.
- "\"What kind of meat is this, anyway?"
- "\" she asked."
- "\"It's the delicious kind,\""
- |
  

- I responded.
- "\"You make a lot of promises,\""
- |
  

- Her husband broke the awkward silence that followed.
- |
  

- "\"I sure hope I don't get mad-cow disease and die from this,\""
- |
  

- Dan said.
- "\"You're not going to get mad-cow disease, Dan,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"How do you know?"
- "\"I know because I know."
- |
  

- This meat is mad-cow-disease-free.
- "\"There's no way to test for it, so how do you know?"
- "\"I bought it from a respectable supermarket."
- "Clare piped up: \"My husband smells the meat in its packaging before he buys it."
- "\"Even still,\""
- |
  

- Dan, "we don't know for certain that we all won't get mad-cow disease and die from eating this meat.
- "\"You're such a pill,\""
- |
  

- Cheryl.
- |
  

- She had unbuttoned the top two buttons of her blouse.
- "\"Just you wait,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"This meat will be worth it."
- "\"I knew a girl whose mom died of mad-cow disease,\""
- |
  

- Cheryl said.
- |
  

- "\"She lived in England."
- |
  

- She and her mom were having lunch in the pub one day and suddenly her mom froze up and then had these weird convulsions until she was all of a sudden dead.
- |
  

- That's how it happens with mad-cow disease.
- |
  

- It turns your brain to jelly and then you freak out and die.
- "\"Both your spine goes rigid and your body goes into seizure,\""
- |
  

- Dan.
- |
  

- "\"You sort of mash yourself up on the inside like you'd swallowed a blender."
- "\"Dan has been watching a lot of Discovery Channel since he's been out of work,\""
- |
  

- Cheryl told us.
- "\"You'd think they'd come up with some kind of pill for mad-cow disease,\""
- |
  

- Clare.
- |
  

- I began taking the meat off the grill.
- "\"Mad-cow is the new syphilis,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"If you want to be an artist, you better eat some mad-cow."
- "\"But it lies dormant 20 years,\""
- |
  

- Clare.
- |
  

- "\"That's the scary thing."
- |
  

- I ate those school hamburgers when I was 10.
- "\"I used to love those school hamburgers,\""
- |
  

- Dan.
- |
  

- "\"Oh Jesus."
- "\"I have no doubt in my mind that I have mad-cow disease,\""
- |
  

- Cheryl.
- |
  

- She said it like it didn't matter.
- "\"Is that meat well done?"
- "\" said Dan."
- |
  

- "\"I want my piece well done."
- I threw a chunk back on the grill and pushed it with the tongs.
- |
  

- Juices dripped into the flame.
- |
  

- "\"OK, Dan,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"Yours will be tough as leather."
- "\"Thanks."
- "\"Sometimes I get these little headaches,\""
- |
  

- Clare.
- |
  

- "\"I wonder if my brain is turning to mush because of mad-cow disease."
- "\"You don't have mad-cow disease, honey,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"It's plenty more difficult to contract than you think."
- "\"Like you care,\""
- |
  

- "\"You probably gave it to me."
- "\"Is that some kind of joke?"
- "\"It wouldn't be the first disease you gave me."
- I pretended she hadn't said that.
- |
  

- But they knew all about us anyway.
- "\"Hell with it,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"Meat's on."
- I looked at Dan.
- |
  

- His wife looked at me.
- |
  

- Clare was still with us, but she was off somewhere.
- |
  

- Then I looked at the plate of steaming meat in the center of the table.
- |
  

- Nobody touched it, nobody dared, even after the coals burned out and the dark evening sky enveloped us.
