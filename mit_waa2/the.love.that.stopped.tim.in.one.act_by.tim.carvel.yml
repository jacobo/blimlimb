  THE SETTING: A boardwalk in a sleepy New Jersey beach community, sometime in
  the 1950s. Or possibly the 1940s. Or the 1960s. It's hard to tell.
  A station wagon pulls up to the beach. The FATHER steps out of the car.
  FATHER
  Everybody up! We're here!
  MOTHER
  (sleepily)
  Wha'? We're here already?
  JUNIOR
  Oh, boy, we're here! I'm gonna go build a sandcastle!

  toward the water.)
  MOTHER

  FATHER opens the back door of the station wagon, leans in, and shakes a
  17-year-old JANET RENO awake.
  FATHER
  Janet? Janet? Wake up: We're finally here.
  JANET RENO
  (sulkily)
  Daaaa-aaad! I was sleeping! And I don't want to go to the stupid old beach
  anyway.

  Oh, come now, Janet. I know you wanted to go to cheerleading camp. But this
  is our last chance to spend a summer together before you go off to school.
  Now come on, punkin, cheer up!
  JANET RENO gets out of the car, begins sulking toward the beach with her
  FATHER, when she hears a wolf-whistle behind her. She stands still, as her
  FATHER continues walking toward the water.
  JANET RENO
  (turning around)
  Hey! Who did that?
  A young, tanned BILL GATES appears, carrying a surfboard.
  BILL GATES
  Sorry, miss. I just had to get your attention. My name's Bill. What's yours?
  JANET RENO
  (blushing)
  It's Janet. Janet Reno.

  Janet Reno. That's a pretty name. Almost as pretty as your eyes.
  JANET RENO blushes.
  BILL GATES
