- And that damn Ark of the Covenant was still just sittin' there, looking all proper and ominous.

- I checked it out on Google again, and it looks like something called the "wrath of God" did this. So I decided to put it back in the crate and write up this trouble report. We should probably put this thing someplace a little safer. That's my suggestion, at least. Could you also send in someone to clean up the dead bodies? They're, like, all over.
