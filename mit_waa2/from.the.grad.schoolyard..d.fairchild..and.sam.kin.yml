  When you're analyzing Joyce
  and your butthole has no choice:
  Diarrhea. Diarrhea.
  When you're paraphrasing Bloom
  and you're stinking up the room:
  Diarrhea. Diarrhea.
  When you're quoting Schopenhauer
  and release a dirty shower:
  Diarrhea. Diarrhea.
  When you're citing Marcel Proust
  and you feel that doo-doo juice:
  Diarrhea. Diarrhea.
  When you're laughing at Voltaire
  and you flood your underwear:
  Diarrhea. Diarrhea.
