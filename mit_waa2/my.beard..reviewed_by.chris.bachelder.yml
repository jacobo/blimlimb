- Must-see beard!
- |
  

- "Reviewer: A. Dawson from San Antonio, TX, USA"
- This is the best beard I've seen all year.
- |
  

- It's one of those beards where you just never want it to end.
- |
  

- If you get a chance, CHECK OUT THIS BEARD.
- |
  

- You won't be sorry.
- |
  

- I guarantee it.
- |
  

- Disappointing
- "Reviewer: Monster Man from Baltimore, MD, USA"
- I see a lot of beards, and I usually really like first beards, so I was excited about seeing Mr. Bachelder's beard, especially after a friend of mine recommended it to me.
- |
  

- But I'm sorry to say that this beard was a big disappointment.
- |
  

- You can see that it has potential, but it's a little patchy and it just isn't doing anything new or interesting.
- |
  

- Not for everyone
- "Reviewer: Melissa T. from Eugene, OR, USA"
- This is one of those beards that not everyone is going to love, but I think it will find a cult following.
- |
  

- It's a really funny and quirky beard.
- |
  

- It's not completely full, but that almost makes it better somehow.
- |
  

- Yes it's uneven and things get stuck in it, but it's a first beard people!
- |
  

- Congratulations, Mr. Bachelder, I can hardly wait for your next beard!
- |
  

- AMAZING!
- |
  

- "Reviewer: JD Vulture from Greenville, NC, USA"
- Oh my God this is an incredible beard!
- |
  

- I saw a small part of Chris Bachelder's beard on the Internet and I just had to go see the whole thing.
- |
  

- I was blown away.
- |
  

- It's a hilarious beard, but it's also sad and touching.
- |
  

- This girl beside me was crying because the beard was so emotional.
- |
  

- I can't do it justice.
- |
  

- Just do yourself a favor and see this beard.
- |
  

- It's an instant classic, and I know you'll love it as much as I did.
- |
  

- Don't believe the hype
- "Reviewer: Paul Russell from Lexington, KY, USA"
- I am baffled by the hype surrounding this beard.
- |
  

- I decided to check the beard out after I read reviews calling it a "daring" beard, a "shockingly original" beard, "one of our best young beards." Some reviewers went so far as to compare it to Vonnegut's first beard.
- |
  

- Well, nothing could be further from the truth.
- |
  

- With Vonnegut, you never lose sight of the integrity and sincerity underlying the beard, but Bachelder's beard is just a tangled joke, and not even very funny, much less deep or substantive.
- |
  

- Right now, the last thing this country needs is more smart-ass facial hair.
- |
  

- At a time like this we need authentic beards.
- |
  

- Bachelder's beard is the same beard we've been seeing for the last fifteen or twenty years, and it's getting old.
- |
  

- Either do it right or shave.
- |
  

- Not great, not horrible
- "Reviewer: RW from Jacksonville, FL, USA"
- Let's not get carried away on either end.
- |
  

- It's not a National Beard Award winner, but it's not trash, either.
- |
  

- Bachelder's got a decent beard.
- |
  

- It has a certain ragged charm, though I agree with others who have said it could have used a trim.
- |
  

- "Reviewer: Jennifer K. from Rochester, NY, USA"
- I just can't believe what passes for a good beard these days.
- |
  

- I teach junior high English, and I've seen better beards on my eighth-graders.
- |
  

- Don't waste your time.
- |
  

- I'll take Hemingway's beard every time over today's beards.
- |
  

- A first look at an up-and-coming beard
- "Reviewer: Night Train from Silver City, CO, USA"
- Even though Mr. Bachelder won't let you touch his beard, his beard will touch you!
- |
  

- See it TODAY!
- |
  

- Surprisingly deep
- "Reviewer: M-Dog from Tempe, AZ, USA"
- I was prepared to hate this beard after I found out about the huge advance that Bachelder got for it.
- |
  

- And to be honest, I didn't think much of the beard when I first saw it, and I almost didn't finish looking at it.
- |
  

- But I stuck with it and I'm glad I did.
- |
  

- This beard has a way of sneaking up on you.
- |
  

- Before I knew it, I was completely engrossed.
- |
  

- It has a deceptively simple appearance, but this beard is actually very complicated and challenging.
- |
  

- If you devote some time and careful attention to Bachelder's beard, it will pay you back, but you have to be willing to work.
