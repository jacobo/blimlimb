- CAN YOU FIX THIS?
- "\"Can you fix this?"
- "\" I asked the handyman, pointing at the stalactites in my ceiling."
- |
  

- "\"No, he said."
- |
  

- DID YOU KNOW?
- I saw on a nature show how this cat's urine glows under a black light.
- |
  

- I thought I was the only one with that power.
- |
  

- SHRIMP
- "When I read that a shrimp's heart is in its head, I thought, we humans are like that: we have a slender elongated body, compressed abdomen, and a long spiny rostrum."
- |
  

- SNEEZE
- If you sneeze too hard, you can fracture a rib.
- |
  

- If you try to suppress a sneeze, you can rupture a blood vessel in your head or neck and die.
- |
  

- If you keep your eyes on the sidewalk, you will occasionally find a quarter, sometimes a dollar.
- |
  

- ALL AND SOME
- Any man, in the right situation, is capable of being a great lover.
- |
  

- But not every man can say, "The sixth sick sheik's sixth sheep's sick.
- "\" In conclusion, great lovers and tongue twisters are not as similar as you might think."

- AUTHOR'S NOTE
- I am an authority on vampires.
- I am an authority on lesbians.
- I am an authority on dreams.
- I am an authority on regression therapy.
- I am an authority on manipulation and propaganda.
- I am dishonest in relationships.
