- I recall returning from Indonesia and understanding, for the first time, that the U.S.

- Perhaps this is obvious, but it wasn't to me then.

- Indonesia had simply decided to stop listening to its leaders.

- The number of people who actively turned against them was very small; only a few hundred showed up at the parliament building to wave flags.

- The United States was so large, and ran on such high levels of communal trust, that it had to be, like Indonesia, unsustainable.

- Indonesia looks like the kind of place where bad things have always happened.

- The police look like police, not like soldiers.
- |
  

- They are authoritative without seeming threatening, and helpful with directions.
- The old colonial buildings with the auto part stores on the first floor need paint, but have a gothic charm.

- A new President takes office in March.

- The soccer team is going to the Olympics.

- Wine is available at soda fountains.

- Steaks are the size of hats and cost four dollars.

- In Santiago there was until very recently a young woman living in a glass house, really about the size of a very small studio apartment, one block from the presidential palace.
- |
  

- The intent of her temporary residence in the house, she says, was to present a work of art on the general themes of privacy and surveillance.
- |
  

- Of course what happened is that a crowd gathered every day for her bath, people looked at her while she was naked, then left.
- |
  

- This was New Hampshire.
- "A block away is a coffee house called the Caf\x8E Haiti, part of a chain which in retrospect follows a fairly obvious business plan."

- "Caf\x8E Haiti, one of which is located nearly every other block downtown, is a \"caf\x8E con piernas,\" or caf\x8E with legs. This means it is exactly like any other caf\x8E in the city, except that the waitresses serve espresso in their underwear. The idea is a porn Starbucks. It is wildly successful and broadly imitated. This is South Carolina."
