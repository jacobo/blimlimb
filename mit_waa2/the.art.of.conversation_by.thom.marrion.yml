- The first time I ever had a real conversation with a woman was in college.
- |
  

- I had chatted with girls all through high school.
- |
  

- I had exchanged some ideas, but never a full conversation.
- |
  

- Then I met Heidi and we started chatting on and off through Christmas break.
- One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was having my very first conversation.
- |
  

- We had quite a few conversations after that, although at first I was insecure about my ability to converse.
- |
  

- Before she met me, Heidi had lived with a man who had a very large vocabulary.
- |
  

- She said that I had quite an extensive vocabulary myself, but men never really believe that kind of thing.
- They say that you should never marry the first person with whom you ever converse.
- |
  

- Maybe they're right.
- |
  

- Heidi and I married and were together for twelve years.
- |
  

- Toward the end we talked less and less, hardly exchanging a word.
- |
  

- Then we were no longer married.
- After Heidi, I ended up with an amazing conversationalist named Asa.
- |
  

- She had been married twice and had some other ill-fated chats, but in all that time she was never allowed to make her point during a conversation.
- |
  

- The man she was with would talk quickly, make his point, and then shut up.
- |
  

- Conversation over.
- |
  

- So she felt that she had a lot to discuss with me.
- |
  

- We talked everywhere.
- |
  

- We talked on the beach, in the park, in a storage shed.
- |
  

- Once, we even talked on one of those green power boxes that you find in the suburbs.
- |
  

- I'm not really sure why they're there.
- |
  

- If nothing else, they are great conversational tools.
- Asa had her share of problems.
- |
  

- All my friends told me that I would be hurt, but I'm a guy.
- |
  

- I was enjoying an amazing variety of conversational topics, so I didn't care.
- |
  

- Then one day Asa said that she had to focus on talking to herself.
- |
  

- She had no time for talk with other people.
- |
  

- She couldn't handle the emotional commitment required to maintain a conversational-type relationship.
- |
  

- In fact, she was sorry we ever talked at all.
- Angela was just about the talking.
- |
  

- When that ended I drove across the country.
- |
  

- I talked to Jessica in Wisconsin, which was the shortest conversation ever.
- |
  

- She decided that she didn't want to talk after all.
- |
  

- Then I talked to Robin in Las Vegas.
- |
  

- Now you would think that someone claiming to be an expert in the Art of Conversation, someone from Las Vegas, a city that's made half its reputation on the wealth of conversations to be found there, you would think someone like that would be a good conversationalist.
- |
  

- You would be wrong.
- When I came back I got involved with a girl from Geneva.
- |
  

- She wasn't the best conversationalist either, but I liked her enough that I didn't care.
- |
  

- When we broke up I told her that I wished we could talk just one more time.
- |
  

- That turned out to be the best conversation we ever had.
- Kristie was a dancer whom I never suspected was interested in speaking with me.
- |
  

- We just started out as friends.
- |
  

- But then we started chatting every chance we could get.
- |
  

- We were slowly developing personal topics and had these deep explorations of themes, until she finally gave an oral presentation that scared her with its emotional intensity.
- |
  

- After that, we never spoke again.
- |
  

- Kristie was afraid of losing herself in a conversation.
- |
  

- She thought it would limit her freedom and give a man power over her.
- Last I heard, Kristie was talking with another women and seemed happy about it.
- |
  

- I thought the other woman seemed really quiet, too quiet for a good conversation, but maybe that was just jealousy talking.
- Since Kristie, I haven't had a good conversation.
- |
  

- There was Mary, from Texas, who was a very selfish speaker and somewhat unskilled.
- |
  

- She never listened to me, she just waited for her turn to speak.
- |
  

- Then there was Jen.
- |
  

- She thought she wanted to have a conversation, but she turned out to be afraid of her own voice.
- That was the last time that I spoke with anyone.
- |
  

- Sometimes I think I'll never find anyone to talk to again, which is stupid, I know that.
- |
  

- I just have to try to relax and let these things happen.
- |
  

- Still, it would be nice to talk to someone.
