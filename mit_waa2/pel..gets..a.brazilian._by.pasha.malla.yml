- "I am Pel\xE9."
- "Many people consider me, Pel\xE9, the greatest footballer of all time."
- |
  

- "It is widely known that Pel\xE9 was born into poverty but still rose to international greatness."
- |
  

- "People are aware that Pel\xE9 scored six goals during the World Cup of Football at only 17 years of age."
- |
  

- "They remember, also, when the Nigerian Civil War stopped for two days so combatants on both sides could watch Pel\xE9 play."
- |
  

- Such is the power, the magic, the wonder .
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9."
- "But what people forget is that Pel\xE9 is human."
- |
  

- "And, like all humans, sometimes the nether regions of Pel\xE9 become unruly."
- |
  

- "But Pel\xE9 does not lag behind the times."
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 respects hygiene; he understands the importance of a smoothly waxed scrotum, perineum, and anus."
- |
  

- "From his years of being the greatest footballer on the planet, Pel\xE9 knows what it means to be sleek and streamlined, to slip through defenders with grace, to unleash your genitalia on an unsuspecting lover and have her remark, \"Now this hairless crotch is what I call sexy."
- Sexy is important.
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 was a sexy footballer, a sexy actor in the 1981 Hollywood movie  Escape to Victory , and he remains sexy at 57 as a father of five, a UNESCO goodwill ambassador, and a Puma spokesman."
- |
  

- "And, in the bedroom, Pel\xE9 does the sorts of sexy things you have read about in lovemaking manuals but never believed were possible."
- |
  

- "Sexy lovemaking maneuvers are nothing to Pel\xE9."
- |
  

- They are like a well-placed header or a delightful, bending free kick.
- |
  

- Still, it is difficult to be sexy when your pubis resembles the unkempt Amazonian jungle.
- |
  

- "And so that is why, every six weeks, Pel\xE9 gets \"a Brazilian."
- "There is a certain spa in Rio de Janeiro that Pel\xE9 frequents."
- |
  

- "The woman he trusts is Maria\x97Maria, with the gentle hands and the knowing smile."
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 is aware that there are those who consider the \"Brazilian\" process painful, but Pel\xE9 feels no pain. The wax does not burn Pel\xE9, and when Pel\xE9's pubic hair is torn from its follicles he never winces or cries out. To admit suffering is weakness. A steely stare upward into the fluorescent lights is all that you will ever get from Pel\xE9. That the spa plays the soothing sounds of Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jo\xE3o Gilberto over its P.A. is helpful, also."
- "In the spa, Pel\xE9 is led by an attendant into a secluded room."
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 knows the drill: He takes off his trousers and, for a few minutes, regards the furry mess down there."
- |
  

- "\"Goodbye,\""
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 might think."
- |
  

- But he will not feel sad.
- |
  

- As the football club must shed its inferior elements, so must a man's loins be free of unsightly short-and-curlies.
- |
  

- "\"At what price glory?"
- "\" wonders Pel\xE9\x97then, smiling, he thinks, \""
- This.
- Maria enters.
- |
  

- First is talcum powder, applied softly, billowing up in clouds.
- |
  

- "Then Maria brings over the heated wax and Pel\xE9 raises his knees so she can apply it with the utmost accuracy."
- |
  

- "First in long strips, then with gentle flicks, then the final O. Pel\xE9 makes no conversation."
- |
  

- "He lies in silence and thinks of his many moments of brilliance, such as when he ran the Uruguayan goalkeeper off the ball in 1970\x97but he fired the cheeky shot wide of goal."
- |
  

- Would it have gone in had he been playing, back then, with a frictionless bald pelvis?
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 smiles."
- |
  

- Perhaps!
- "Antonio Carlos Jobim and Jo\xE3o Gilberto are doing \"Meditaci\xF3n,\" and Maria sambas away while the wax hardens around Pel\xE9's private parts. Alone for a moment, Pel\xE9 imagines the dusty courtyard of his youth, where, now, a towheaded barefoot child is freezing his defender with step-overs. Just like Pel\xE9 as a boy. But will this boy be the next Pel\xE9? It is unlikely. Of more pressing urgency is the fact that the boy will soon start puberty\x97is it not Pel\xE9's responsibility to lead an outreach program into the favelas, offering free \"Brazilians\" to promising but disadvantaged youth?"
- Then Maria comes back, wearing the gloves.
- |
  

- "These mean: it is time."
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 breathes."
- |
  

- "What Pel\xE9 does at this point is similar to taking a penalty."
- |
  

- "Once the ball is on the spot, Pel\xE9 relaxes, visualizes, focuses; then the approach ."
- |
  

- The grandstand erupts in cheers and fireworks and song!
- |
  

- "With Maria moving in, Pel\xE9 closes his eyes."
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 opens his eyes."
- |
  

- Maria winks.
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 breathes."
- |
  

- "At last, Pel\xE9 is ready."
- "Maria tears the first strip of wax from Pel\xE9's body, then the next, then the next."
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9's mind is a white-walled room."
- |
  

- Everything is light.
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9 is vaguely aware of Maria ripping away down there, of a vague heat flashing up through his loins, but he is elsewhere, playing a through ball to Garrincha, delighting fans of the New York Cosmos upon his arrival in America, hugging the Dalai Lama\x97and holding him, holding him close."
- |
  

- The white room returns, pulsing, flashing.
- |
  

- "\"Come on, Pel\xE9,\""
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9\x97maybe he even speaks it aloud."
- |
  

- "\"You can make it."
- |
  

- You son of a bitch, you can make it!
- And then, like that, it is over.
- |
  

- Maria steps away.
- |
  

- From her upper lip she is sweating.
- |
  

- "The room swims away from Pel\xE9, and then back in."
- |
  

- He blinks.
- |
  

- He sits up.
- |
  

- His loins are burning, but it is no matter.
- |
  

- Strewn around the floor are strips of golden wax, flecked with black curls.
- He looks up, and Maria is peeling off her gloves and dropping them into a bin.
- |
  

- "\"You can pay at reception,\""
- |
  

- "Pel\xE9, and then is gone, off to continue her work, to do her part in making Rio the sexiest town on earth."
- "That is when Pel\xE9 looks down, and smiles."
- |
  

- "Of course, a true \"Brazilian\" is never a complete wax; there is always something left behind\x97a souvenir, a memory. Maria's \"Brazilians\" are no exception."
- "What has Maria left behind, this time, for Pel\xE9?"
- |
  

- "Maria has left the letter V. And what is the V for, pointing down at Pel\xE9's manhood, as though to say, \"Here it is, look, here it is\"? The V\x97the V that Maria has crafted from Pel\xE9's pubes, using only wax and love and sleight of hand\x97this V, my friends, this very sexy letter V, stands for Victory."

  I am Pel\xE9.\n\
