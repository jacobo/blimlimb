- Baby, come home, please.
- |
  

- "I'm sorry\x97I wasn't even thinking when I gave that character your name."
- |
  

- I guess I just love you so much that your name is always on my mind.
- |
  

- I didn't realize that calling a cheating, drug-addicted truck-stop prostitute Torri might hurt your feelings.
- After all, just because you guys have the same name doesn't mean you're the same person.
- |
  

- Sure, you're both medium-height brunettes with blond highlights, hazel eyes, and briefcase-shaped birthmarks on your left breasts, but that's just a coincidence.
- |
  

- I also wrote that she was chunky around the middle, with gravity and age dragging her breasts to her knees.
- |
  

- See?
- |
  

- I would never say that about you.
- Come back from your mother's, honey, please.
- |
  

- You can't be happy there, the way she constantly nags at you in that whiny voice of hers.
- |
  

- And she's probably tired of hearing you talk about all this, anyway.
- |
  

- I'm sure she doesn't want to hear you go on and on the way you do.
- Speaking of your mother, no, of course the hooker's mom isn't based on her!
- |
  

- "The names are completely different: Valeria has an  l , Victoria has a  t \x97and Torri's mom doesn't knit, she crochets."
- |
  

- That is, streetwalker Torri, not you Torri.
- And I have to object to your saying the main character is just a thinly disguised version of me.
- |
  

- Yes, I know Bryan and Ryan are similar, but really, all my characters are totally fictional.
- |
  

- I mean, Bryan winds up winning the lottery, divorcing Torri after he finds out what a whore she is, and becoming an international playboy.
- |
  

- All I have in common with him is our stamp collections.
- |
  

- Leagues apart.
- Plus, Bryan's thumb-wrestling fetish is all made up.
- |
  

- Completely.
- Oh, and that bookmark?
- |
  

- On my computer?
- |
  

- "\"How to lower sperm count\""
- |
  

- That was  just research.
- |
  

- For Bryan.
- |
  

- My recent interest in long-distance bicycling is coincidental.
- Honey, Torri, come home.
- |
  

- What would I do without you?
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- Also, I would never spike your mint lattes with mouthwash.
- |
  

- Now you're just imagining things.
