- With Asian civil-rights activists, New York flash mobs, and teenaged Kansans trading up-to-the-minute crush reconnaissance in fifth-period Algebra, the text message has established itself as a revolutionary, if not labor efficient, means of communication.

- For those (like this editor) not versed in the art, letters can be generated by multiple clicks of a certain digit on a modern cell phone's face.
- |
  

- On the 1 key, for example, "a" is one click, but "c" is three.
- |
  

- For each category below (one-click letters, two-click letters, three, and four), use the clues to come up with a sentence that uses only letters of that click value.
- |
  

- For example,
- "One click:"
- "Clue: A daughter suggests a geographic illustration to enhance her father's directions to the office picnic."
- "Answer: Add a map, dad."
- "For those without a cell phone handy, here are the letters that can be made with each digit:   1. NONE"

- McSweeney's book.

- One Click
- A dripping canine is urged to placate the beloved head of the household with his only trick.
- Two Clicks
- Exclamation upon encountering a particularly regal member of the Hymenoptera family.
- Three Clicks
- A nearly tearful child, frustrated with his parakeet's refusal to leave his perch, offers an ultimatum.

- "Hint: The parakeet is named after an actor in westerns or a fast food chain."
- Four Clicks
- Soundly slumbering.
