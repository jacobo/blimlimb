  Hey, Dan\x97\n\
  I like your jokes, and I know there's a whole different side to you that not everybody gets to see. Even if you don't want to be \"deep\" or whatever, it would be cool to hang out sometime. I'll miss you, and the marketing department will never be the same! Maybe sometime we could just talk on the phone. Take it easy, and don't work too hard over the summer.\n\
