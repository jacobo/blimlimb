- "Q: What fraternity are you a member of?"
- "Nick Prybella: Delta Rho Sigma."
- |
  

- That's Triangle, P, then an E shape.
- "Q: How did you become president of your fraternity?"
- "Prybella: When elections came up in November people started approaching me saying, \"Hey you should run for President, I bet you'd be good."
- |
  

- I'd know I 'd vote for you.
- "\" When it came to November there were three people running, and I guess I won at the house meeting."
- "Q: So there was no electoral college or anything?"
- "Prybella: No. It's just a house vote."
- |
  

- So majority wins.
- "Q: What does being President involve?"
- |
  

- What are your duties?
- "Prybella: On paper, the duties are that you must handle all external affairs."
- |
  

- You oversee everything.
- |
  

- You have to play the politics of everything; managing the houses relations with other frats and sororities.
- |
  

- Also you have to manage everything internally, making sure everything runs smoothly.
- |
  

- If our pledges did something stupid and they got caught for it, I was the one who people e-mailed or who the cops would come to see.
- |
  

- You have to explain the actions of other members of the fraternity and apologize to the school and other fraternities.
- |
  

- I might have to make up for it with apology letters or clean-ups.
- |
  

- Also, internally I have vice presidents under me.
- |
  

- There is a whole structure set up, and I have to make sure everyone under me does his job.
- |
  

- They, in turn, make sure people under them do their jobs.
- "Q: What area have you found most difficult about being the President?"
- "Prybella: I'd have to say putting the rules in front of your friends."
- |
  

- Everyone wants you to bend the rules for him.
- |
  

- As president you can't be everyone's friend.
- |
  

- You have to do what the right thing is to do.
- |
  

- And that doesn't necessarily make everyone happy.
- |
  

- The biggest thing is trying to explain yourself to everyone so they know where you're coming from.
- "Q: Is it true that you were once kidnapped by some of your own fraternity brothers?"
- "Prybella: Yes."
- |
  

- What we do is we tell the pledges that an activity they can do to teach them togetherness is that they can kidnap a brother.
- |
  

- The pledges came to the house and said there was a fight, and I went to go check it out and stop it.
- |
  

- They dragged us in and duct-taped us to a chair.
- |
  

- We were pretty much there for a couple of hours.
- |
  

- The other brothers are supposed to come rescue us and break us out.
- |
  

- It was a real ordeal.
- |
  

- The dorm room got trashed, but we got our way out of it.
- "Q: So you weren't angry afterward and you didn't fire anyone?"
- "Prybella: There was no firing that took place."
- |
  

- The only angry thing was that I had to write a paper for the next day, and I didn't get to do it.
- |
  

- And they didn't really duct tape us in any awkward or sexual positions so I wasn't that upset.
- "Q: What can you do to punish those who do break rules and have no regard for the sanctity of the fraternity?"
- "Prybella: We have a judicial board and we handle all punishments internally."
- |
  

- Sometimes if people get out of control we write them up or bring them up for judiciary committee.
- |
  

- Their peers hand out the punishment.
- |
  

- So they might have to do a certain number of hours of cleaning the house.
- |
  

- It is kind of seen as a lack of respect so we take it pretty seriously.
- "Q: I remember you once told me that if you rang the house's fire bell three times people were on high alert."
- |
  

- Is it sort of like the military's Def Con system?
- "Prybella: Very similar."
- |
  

- Not exactly though.
- |
  

- This old fire bell &#151; you can hear it all throughout campus, and if you hear it three times you are supposed to drop everything and come running.
- |
  

- Usually it signifies a fight will ensue.
- |
  

- One time this drunk guy at a party started feeling up one of the brother's girlfriends so we closed down the party and she pointed out who the guy was as everyone was leaving.
- |
  

- We brought him into this hallway and the house bell was rung three times.
- |
  

- I heard the bell three times and came down in my underwear because that's what you're supposed to do, just come from anywhere.
- |
  

- The kid was in the corner, drunk.
- |
  

- The girl's boyfriend tells the guy if he says he's sorry he'll let him go.
- |
  

- People are begging him to just say he's sorry so they can let him go.
- |
  

- So finally the kid apologizes, and then the brother tells him, "You think just because you say you're sorry, we're going to let you go?
- "\" And the guys started knocking him around a bit."
- |
  

- I was risk manager of the house at the time, so I had to break it up, because it wasn't very safe.
- |
  

- But when you hear the bell you know there is trouble and you have to come running.
- "Q: How do you balance schoolwork with Greek life?"
- "Prybella: It was pretty tough when I was President."
- |
  

- Time management.
- |
  

- I kind of enjoyed Greek life more so; school work was sacrificed at times.
- "Q: Do you have any regrets about the way you led as President?"
- "Prybella: No regrets."
- |
  

- I think I led pretty well.
- |
  

- There were problems and we handled them.
- |
  

- And I think everyone was pretty happy.
- |
  

- And if they weren't, screw them.
- "Q: How do you feel now that your term has ended?"
- "Prybella: Very good."
- |
  

- Presidency took all of my time.
- |
  

- I couldn't come home.
- |
  

- I couldn't drink at the parties.
- |
  

- Now I can relax, and I am pretty much causing the most trouble for the current President.
- "Q: Right."
- |
  

- Are you secretly wishing the new President trips and falls or pronounces words incorrectly so that you can solidify in your mind that you ruled better than he did?
- "Prybella: Definitely."
- |
  

- Most definitely.
- |
  

- I'm always wishing he would screw up at house meetings.
- |
  

- I'm secretly giving him the evil eye.
- |
  

- And internally I'm doing things to damage the house so it looks bad on him and in turn, people will realize how great I really was.
- "Q: And what is your role now in the fraternity?"
- "Prybella: Now I have a minor role."
- |
  

- People come up to me and ask me advice.
- |
  

- I try to stay out of it mostly.
- |
  

- I'm trying not to get too involved with Presidential problems.
- |
  

- They are so difficult I don't want to get dragged into it.
- |
  

- I figure I put up with so much crap as President I want to try and stay out of it.
- |
  

- But if someone asks me I try and impart whatever knowledge I've gained to the best of my ability.
- "Q: Years from now what will you say when you look back on your experience as President of your fraternity?"
- "Prybella: I'll say that being President definitely taught me the most."
- |
  

- I think it has improved my abilities to deal with a lot of people.
- |
  

- I learned different leadership qualities, such as how to juggle people and also how to make them happy.
- |
  

- It has made me a better politician, learning the art of bullshitting with people when you had to cover your own ass.
