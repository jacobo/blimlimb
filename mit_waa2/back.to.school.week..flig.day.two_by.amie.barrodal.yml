  Now that you are a pilot, you should talk like a pilot.  Whether you've
  just completed an amateur training course, or are a seasoned pilot with poor
  vocabulary, this guide is intended to provide you with the minimum of
  expressions required to communicate effectively with fellow pilots, like
  yourself.
  Keep this guide close at hand.  Perhaps in a pocket, or attached to a
  chain.
  Chain is no longer chain.  Chain is loop.  The door of your plane is the
  hatch.  The chain suspending your opened hatch is the hatch-loop.  The
  door-handle of your hatch is not called a "hatch-handle."  It is a skib. 
  Amateur pilots refer to skibs as hatch-handles, and are laughed at.  If your
  skib were gilt in brass, it'd still be a skib.
  The front of your plane is the nose.  The back is the tail.  Stand facing
  forward in your plane.  Your right-hand side is your starboard side.  Your
  left-hand side is your port.  If you are facing rear, your starboard side is
  your left-hand side, and your port-side is to your right.
  Your steering wheel is your grip.  The controls are contols.  The windshield
  is the face.  The windshield-wipers are Carlos and Hernando. If your plane
  has a water-fountain, it is a scuttlebutt.  Seasoned pilots will refer to a
  gossip as a Scuttlebutt.  "Tom's wife is a Scuttlebutt."  You are not a
  seasoned pilot.
  The upstairs of your plane is up-top.  Downstairs is down-below.  The floor
  is the gangway.  The bathroom is the lavatory.  Do not call the lavatory the
  head. Head is sailor-speak.  A sailor is a filthy animal, with cloven hooves
  and Trichinosis.  To greet a fellow pilot, say "Hello on the Virgin
  Princess."  If you cannot make out the name of his plane, say "Hello aboard
  the Jackal."  Pull down your grip so the nose of your plane points high.  If
  you know how to execute spins and dives, you may wish to execute spins and
  dives.  Spins and dives tell your fellow pilot: Hello, is not today a
  capital day, for flying?
