- Richard Grayson is a write-in candidate in Florida's Fourth Congressional District.
- |
  

- He is a registered Democrat, but did not have the $9,000 filing fee to receive the official party designation.

- Friday, July 23
- Yesterday, the House passed the Marriage Protection Act.
- |
  

- This bill strips federal courts of jurisdiction over the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law saying that states need not recognize same-sex-union laws of other states.
- In other words, Congress is saying it should be able to pass a law and prevent courts from even  considering  the law's constitutionality.
- Rep.
- |
  

- Crenshaw, like most Republicans, voted for this ludicrous bill.
- Thirty-five years ago, Crenshaw graduated from the University of Florida law school.
- Ten years ago, I graduated from the same school with high honors.
- |
  

- I'm sure Constitutional Law has always been a required course.
- Crenshaw must have read  Marbury v. Madison , the 1803 ruling establishing judicial review.
- |
  

- He should know the Supreme Court is the final authority on a law's constitutionality.
- I actually first learned about  Marbury v. Madison  and separation of powers back in junior high.
- So what was Crenshaw doing at UF?
- |
  

- Well, I've heard he founded a chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ and courted his wife Kitty there.
- |
  

- Back then, Kitty's father, Claude Kirk, was the Republican governor.
- Kirk was a flamboyant figure, a kind of Floridian Huey Long.
- |
  

- "At his inaugural ball, the divorced governor introduced his stunning young fianc\xE9e only as \"Madame X.\" A populist, Kirk shook up a sleepy Southern state."
- In 1988, I voted for Kirk, who had switched parties, in the Democratic Senate primary.
- |
  

- He finished fifth, with 5 percent of the vote.
- |
  

- "\"It's lonely here at the bottom,\""
- |
  

- Kirk said.
- At Alabama Law School, Kirk said, he never got above a C.
- But I bet Kirk knows that the courts will declare the Marriage Protection Act unconstitutional.
- |
  

- I bet his son-in-law knows it, too.
- Of course, Congress could always pass a Marriage Protection Act Protection Act to try to prevent that.
- |
  

- And a Marriage Protection Act Protection Act Protection Act after that.
- My head hurts to think about it.
- |
  

- Tuesday, July 27
- The League of Women Voters of Tallahassee has invited me to participate in some campaign events they are sponsoring.
- |
  

- Among them is "Bandwagon 2004," to take place at the WFSU public-TV studio on Red Barber Plaza.
- "\"Bandwagon 2004\""
- |
  

- TV show that will give candidates for Congress, county commissioner, sheriff, tax collector, property appraiser, and Ochlockonee River Soil & Water Conservation Supervisor the opportunity to have two minutes of airtime.
- The letter says, "The Bandwagon 2004 atmosphere again will be that of an old-fashioned political rally complete with lively music such as that of John Philip Sousa or a barbershop quartet when your two minutes are up.
- |
  

- You are encouraged to bring supporters (no more than 10 per candidate) carrying campaign signs.
- |
  

- These supporters and the signs may appear on television, too.
- The Fourth Congressional District is so weirdly drawn to include the maximum number of GOP voters that it extends over 160 miles from its heart in Jacksonville to take in a Republican sliver of Florida's capital city.
- Tallahassee is a great town, but it's a nine-hour drive from my house&#8212;too far to go for two minutes on TV.
- |
  

- Friday, July 30
- Yesterday, I got a notice to pick up a certified letter at the post office.
- |
  

- It turns out to be from the Christian Coalition of Florida, asking me to fill out their candidate-issues survey.
- These questionnaires are coming in at the rate of about one a day now.
- |
  

- This must be religious week, as I got one a few days ago from Joyce Meyers Ministries.
- At first I was impressed, because Joyce Meyers Ministries' questions were worded so neutrally that I couldn't tell they were typical right-wing nuts till I checked their website.
- |
  

- "Then I realized that Joyce Meyers Ministries must maintain a fa\xE7ade of nonpartisanship to keep their tax exemption as a religious organization."
- The Christian Coalition survey lists 97 issues.
- |
  

- "Next to each one, I must draw a circle around the appropriate letter: \"S\"=Support, \"O\"=Oppose, \"U\"=Undecided."
- It also has spaces for me to fill in my pastor's name and my church.
- |
  

- I write "None" in both those spaces. I'm an atheist.
- But given the state of my campaign, I'm thinking about offering a novena to St.
- |
  

- Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes.
- |
  

- Saturday, July 31
- The survey in this morning's mail comes not from a religious group but from the Florida Music Educators' Association.
- |
  

- While Crenshaw wants to sharply cut arts funding, I support the FMEA's positions on strengthening the fine-arts curriculum in the schools.
- "Their final question:"
- "\"What cultural events (concerts, exhibitions, etc."
- |
  

- "I jot down a few, and then write:"
- "\"I don't have space or time to list all of them."
- |
  

- Right now I'm on my way to the Pompano Beach Amphitheater for the Warped Tour, where I will encourage the children in the mosh pit to appreciate fine music.
- I hope the fine music includes Taking Back Sunday's "You're So Last Summer.
- "\" That song should be taught in every school in this state."
