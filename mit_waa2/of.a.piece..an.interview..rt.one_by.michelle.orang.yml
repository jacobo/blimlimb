- "Q: Hi Dad."
- |
  

- Have you heard from the Spaniards yet?
- "Orange: No."
- "Q: Nothing?"
- "Orange: Nada."
- "Q: I jumped ahead a bit there."
- |
  

- Now, it took Michelangelo three years to complete the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, how long did it take you to finish the jigsaw puzzle version?
- "Orange: Two and a half years."
- "Q: What are its dimensions, now that it's done?"
- "Orange: The dimensions are 272 cm by 96 cm."
- "Q: And what's that in Yankee?"
- "Orange: About three feet by ten feet."
- "Q: How did you come into possession of such a thing?"
- "Orange: [laughs] I was given the puzzle by my precious daughter, who was trying to drive me insane so I would commit suicide."
- "Q: Right."
- |
  

- Why did you decide to take it on?
- "Orange: Well, because we'd done a puzzle every Christmas for the last five or six Christmases and  we were all going to do it ."
- "Q: I know, but how come you kept on doing it after we left?"
- "Orange: Well because it was a challenge."
- |
  

- A 9,000-piece puzzle?
- |
  

- I wanted to see if it could be done.
- "Q: From what I remember, all we could do that Christmas was sort out the border pieces."
- |
  

- What was your first line of attack?
- "Orange: Well you started working on one end and you actually got details down, by looking at that dark blue of the stained glass, with the yellow running through it."
- |
  

- When you got about ten square inches of it done, I was amazed that you could sort them out that way, and I decided I would work from one side to the other, because the right-hand side of the puzzle has brighter colors than the left-hand side.
- "Q: Yes."
- |
  

- That was a slightly controversial move, if I may say, because you finished the section that's closest to the altar first, while Michelangelo actually worked from the other end toward the altar.
- "Orange: Oh, really?"
- |
  

- I think they just took this picture for the puzzle before they were done restoring it, because the one half definitely has brighter colors than the other.
- "Q: No, because when I saw it this year, you can see that his style evolved into much more intricate, brighter compositions as he moved across the ceiling over time."
- "Orange: Oh."
- |
  

- Well, suffice it to say that it's easier to sort the puzzle pieces by color when you have bright colors for one end and duller colors for the other.
- |
  

- When I sorted the colors, it became clear that it would be easier to do the brighter side first.
- "Q: I'm smart, right?"
- "Orange: The side that was in the den."
- "Q: When did you realize that whole the puzzle wouldn't fit on the family room floor?"
- "Orange: Well, when I got into it about a month after that, I realized that you couldn't look at the whole thing at once, so I had to get each half into a more manageable space."
- |
  

- Half in the family room and the other half down the hall in the den.
- "Q: And when did you put the cardboard under it, from our refrigerator box?"
- "Orange: At the very beginning, I cut that cardboard up."
- "Q: Did any of your strategies progress organically?"
- "Orange: What do you mean?"
- "Q: I don't know."
- "Orange: Well, by \"organically\" do you mean \"changing strategies as I go along\"?"
- "Q: I honestly don't know."
- "Orange: What I realized was that the arches containing the sybils and delphis could actually be put in more easily than I thought they could, because they're all of a slightly different color, and design, and the pieces of the arches would tell me what color I needed inside that lunette."
- |
  

- They formed the most important part, the central frame, because that holds the whole central panel, if I could get that in, then that would tell me exactly where things end and where things begin.
- |
  

- So I spent lots of time putting in the central frame first in one half and then in the other, and once I had the central frame, that established the overall design, and once you have that.
- |
  

- "Q: So what you're saying is that the central frame is pretty much useless as far as strategies go."
- "Orange: ."
- |
  

- "Q: Were you on sabbatical the year I gave you the puzzle?"
- "Orange: I was on sabbatical the following year."
- "Q: And did the puzzle get extra attention during that year?"
- "Orange: In a way, since I was at home, and when I got tired of doing the work I was doing, it was a way of distracting myself without having to, you know, go out."
- "Q: Did you ever ignore the phone, doorbell or shower when you were working?"
- "Orange: No, I wouldn't say so."
- |
  

- You're the one who ignores the phone.
- "Q: Oh-ho!"
- |
  

- If I ignore the phone, you positively snub it.
- "Orange: Hmmm."
- "Q: What about the puzzle reward system that developed when you were marking essays."
- "Orange: Well that was the next year when I had to mark essays again."
- |
  

- Yeah, I would mark&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I would say, "If I can get through these two essays, I'll give myself half an hour with the puzzle.
- "Q: I thought it was you got to put one piece in, inconsiderate of duration."
- "Orange: Oh well, sometimes I would say, I'll put in one or two pieces and then go back to work."
- |
  

- Again, it's the same kind of distraction.
- "Q: Do you think any of your students benefited, say if you had a particularly satisfying go of it between essays, and you came back fresh, that the next student got the benefit of that?"
- "Orange: Oh, I don't think so."
- "Q: I mean, if you were really on fire, and locked a piece that you'd been looking for for months, you don't think that would bias you when you pick up the pencil again?"
- |
  

- Or maybe whip through one so you could get back to the puzzle?
- "Orange: No. Well, it would affect my mood but not my marking."
- |
  

- But I must say, it does give one a sense of satisfaction to get a couple pieces in over the course of the day.
- "Q: More satisfaction than correcting it's/its over and over again?"
- "Orange: Surely."
- |
  

- The interesting thing about that is that at night, I trained myself to remember the pieces I had put in or sometimes they would just occur to me&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the pieces I had put in that day&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and that would give me such a feeling of satisfaction that I could fall asleep at night.
- "Q: [laughing pretty hard] Would you count down the puzzle pieces, like sheep, to get to sleep?"
- "Orange: It depends on how much I did that day, but I'd go over in my mind how I found the piece and realized where it went."
- |
  

- I'd rarely get past four or five.
- |
  

- I could certainly reconstruct the more difficult pieces.
- |
  

- The ones that I could remember the best were the ones that I'd been looking for for months, that would give me a real satisfaction.
- |
  

- In fact, there were two pieces I could not find for the whole two years and I only found them when I was almost finished the puzzle.
- "Q: Why, did you have them in the wrong spot?"
- "Orange: No, they were just of a monochrome color, and the shapes are all pretty much the same so I always assumed these pieces went someplace else."
- |
  

- It never occurred to me they'd be back where I was before.
- |
  

- Then when I found them, man, when I found them I jumped up and down and whooped and yelled and twirled&nbsp;&#151;
- "Q: You did?"
- "Orange: Yeah."
- "Q: You twirled?"
- "Orange: Yes, I twirled."
- "Q: Um, how many Zip-loc bags were enlisted for this project?"
- "Orange: A whole package."
- "Q: How many bags did you have going at the height of it?"
- "Orange: Well, I didn't count but my guess would be, probably thirty-five."
- "Q: And what sort of a system did you come up with?"
- "Orange: It started out with colors, one bag of colors, one bag of body parts, one bag of just white pieces, browns, and then gradually the whites got divided into off-white, bright-white, yellow-white, grey-white, blue-white."
- |
  

- "Q: Did you ever have a problem with Michelangelo's handling of the female body?"
- |
  

- I mean, did it ever confuse you, since his women tend to be built like linebackers, where you'd look at a piece and think that that big bicep belonged in the 'man' bag and it would end up belonging to a woman?
- "Orange: The way they cut the puzzle you could hardly tell that body parts were body parts, the pieces were too small."
- |
  

- What struck me when I was going through it is that there are so few women in it.
- "Q: And aren't only the men nude?"
- "Orange: Eve is about the only nude woman in it, which surprises me, I thought there were more than that, but it turns out, when you look closely, those figures are not women, they're just."
- |
  

- "Q: Did you get the equivalent of a Christian theology course in studying the scenes for so long?"
- "Orange: I learned that I don't know who these people are."
- |
  

- I don't know what they're doing.
- |
  

- I know they're sybils but I don't know why he chose to put them in there.
- |
  

- I don't know why he put Judith Holofernes where she is, and Jonah.
- |
  

- Jonah makes no sense to me.
- |
  

- There's a fish, but no whale, and Jonah's not even an old man, he looks like a young man.
- "Q: When were the puzzle hiatus periods?"
- "Orange: I got very busy when I went back to work last year, so for about five months I didn't work on it."
- "Q: What about the emotional setback you had?"
- "Orange: That was when JB and Nadia were coming to live here in the Summer of 2000 and I was going on vacation, the question was, would the kids and the dog upset the puzzle?"
- |
  

- And that was a real concern so, I tried to transfer the other half of the puzzle into the den so we could close the door and they could still use the family room.
- |
  

- The puzzle is wider than the door and I turned the cardboard and it slanted and then the whole thing just slid into itself, and half of it came apart.
- |
  

- It took three weeks to put most of those big sections back where they belonged and it took me a good two months after I got back from vacation to put the other 150 or so pieces back in.
- "Q: Did you cry?"
- "Orange: No. I cursed."
- "Q: Did you twirl angrily?"
- "Orange: No, I cursed and I stamped and I pounded my fists on the ground."
- "Q: Ah."
- |
  

- Did that help?
- "Orange: No. It dislodged two other pieces."
- |

  Q: Hi Dad. Have you heard from the Spaniards yet?
  Orange: No.
  Q: Nothing?
  Orange: Nada.
  Q: I jumped ahead a bit there. Now, it took Michelangelo three years to complete the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, how long did it take you to finish the jigsaw puzzle version?
