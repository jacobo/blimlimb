- A DISPATCH BY  CHRIS MCAVOY
- |
  

- LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;In early 1999, I began my career as a Unix High Availability Clustering consultant.
- |
  

- I love my work.
- |
  

- Unix is an amazing computer operating system, created by hippies, owned by no one, maintained by those with poor social skills, and revered by big business.
- After several months of training, I settled into a steady pattern of travel, expense accounts, and documenting the living hell out of anything I did.
- |
  

- One day, I received a call from my manager.
- |
  

- "\"Hey,\""
- |
  

- "\"you want to work at NASA?"
- "\" Of course, I replied."
- |
  

- My knowledge of the solar system was up to par, I knew I could Cluster them to High Availability in no time.
- |
  

- "\"Ok, you're going to have to sign a non-disclosure form, go to New Mexico, and you might have to learn ocean survival."
- About that non-disclosure form, I am legally bound by this document.
- |
  

- I cannot talk about the particulars of the assignment.
- |
  

- "I can, however, give you an idea of what was involved: satellites, oil, ocean-going vessels, men wearing TAG Heuer watches, and most importantly, Unix clusters."
- "I met my contact person in a Mexican caf\xE9 just outside the Los Alamos National Laboratory."
- |
  

- His name was Mike, he had long hair, a love of album rock, and an inexhaustible supply of black T-shirts.
- The road into Los Alamos was not monitored by the kind of law enforcement that pay attention to speed.
- |
  

- They're looking for spies, invaders, and foreigners.
- |
  

- Mike pushed his small pick-up truck to its limits.
- |
  

- The mathematically perfect pounding of Rush ebbed and flowed as we crested each hill, caught air, and landed on the other side.
- |
  

- I questioned my huevos rancheros breakfast decision, and tried to make small talk.
- Mike lived on a small farm in Las Cruces with his family and his pecan trees.
- |
  

- The income from the trees allowed him to live rent-free.
- |
  

- He came to Las Cruces when he was in his early twenties, planted the trees, and came back fifteen years later to build his home.
- At the lip of the Lab, two security guards stopped our roller coaster ride.
- |
  

- One was an old man, counting the days to retirement.
- |
  

- The other was a young man, sporting a crew cut and aviator glasses.
- |
  

- They have in common their enormous revolvers.
- |
  

- They photocopy my license, have me fill out a few forms, and hand me a black badge.
- |
  

- The black badge means I have to be escorted.
- |
  

- "\"Yes, even in the bathroom,\""
- |
  

- Then they handed me the rule sheet.
- |
  

- There are eleven rules on the rule sheet.
- |
  

- Rule number six was my favorite.
- |
  

- It said, in short, that if you ask your escort about something, and the escort says he/she can't talk about it, don't ask again, it's probably top secret.
- The lobby of the Lab was unimpressive, except for the diorama about the Native Americans that lived in the area, before nuclear bombs and whatnot.
- "\"I have no idea who killed Kennedy,\""
- |
  

- Mike.
- "\"Is that a rule six?"
- "\" I asked."
- "\"No.\""
- "\"What about Bob Crane?"
- "\"Who?"
- "\"Did Sam Giancana get JFK elected?"
- "\"Who's that?"
- "\"He was a gangster."
- "\"I don't know."
- "\"Rule six?"
- "\"No.\""
- We had a project meeting.
- |
  

- On the white board, there was an extensive diagram of a space shuttle engine drawn in erase-able marker.
- |
  

- Someone had been trying to figure out what it meant to "light that candle!
- "\" Engineers do that kind of stuff."
- "\"I've never seen Close Encounters,\""
- |
  

- Mike.
- "\"Oh, it's about aliens."
- |
  

- Does the lab maintain alien encounter flow charts or anything?
- "\"Huh?"
- "\"Like, if aliens showed up, is there some kind of contingency plan?"
- "\"I doubt it."
- "\"Have you ever met them?"
- "\"Who?"
- "\"Deny all you want you crafty S.O."
- B.
- |
  

- The rules of the IT profession were thrown out the window on this project.
- |
  

- One of our servers was kept in a tuff-shed in the desert.
- |
  

- While working in the sun, I saw a man fall off the tuff-shed roof and break his elbow.
- "\"I like Rush,\""
- |
  

- Mike.
- "\"Sheesh."
- "\"What's wrong with Rush?"
- "\"I can't put my finger on it, they're just awful."
- |
  

- Do you guys ever experiment on animals?
- "\"No.\""
- "\"The homeless?"
- "\"No.\""
- We worked in a room that has space shuttle communications piped in over loudspeakers.
- |
  

- It was fun to listen to the astronauts as they did their tests.
- |
  

- They are a bland bunch.
- |
  

- They enjoy science and fitness.
- |
  

- One Saturday afternoon, the space shuttle astronauts were speaking in German.
- "\"Those aren't the astronauts,\""
- |
  

- Mike.
- "\"Who are they?"
- "\"Rule six."
