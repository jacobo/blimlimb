- Scene opens at a roadside gas station somewhere in Swing State.
- |
  

- SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER  is inside, balancing his books behind the counter.
- |
  

- Enter  JOE SIX-PACK , who heads straight for the refrigerated section.
- |
  

- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: Hello, stranger."
- |
  

- I'm Small-Business Owner.
- |
  

- I'm concerned about the rising cost of health insurance for my employees.
- |
  

- Welcome to my small business.
- "JOE SIX-PACK: Thanks."
- |
  

- I'm Joe Six-Pack.
- |
  

- True to my name, I'd like to purchase six cans of domestic beer from your small business, and I'd like them to be connected by a subdivided plastic holder.
- |
  

- I'm sort of racist, though no one ever comes out and directly says this.
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: That'll be $5."
- |
  

- I may or may not get a tax break under either Barack Obama's or John McCain's tax plan.
- "JOE SIX-PACK: Put it on my tab."
- |
  

- I'll pay for this beer with easy credit, which will eventually lead to an economic crisis.
- |
  

- The door dings as it opens, and  HOCKEY MOM  enters.
- |
  

- "HOCKEY MOM: Oh,  jeez , how are ya?"
- |
  

- I'm Hockey Mom.
- |
  

- I'm like Soccer Mom, only colder.
- |
  

- I'm up in arms over the risin' cost of gas.
- "JOE SIX-PACK: I, too, am feeling squeezed at the pump."
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: Enjoy your six-pack."
- |
  

- My entrepreneurial spirit is the backbone of the American economy.
- "JOE SIX-PACK: Thank you."
- |
  

- I'll spend the rest of the afternoon watching football and drinking with my friends, Working-Class White, Nascar Dad, and Those Without College Degrees.
- |
  

- I do not care for the gays.
- |
  

- JOE SIX-PACK  exits.
- |
  

- "HOCKEY MOM: How much do I owe ya for gas?"
- |
  

- I'm bitter about Hillary Clinton losing.
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: Seven thousand six hundred and twenty dollars."
- "HOCKEY MOM: Oh,  jeez ."
- |
  

- Thankfully, I married Those Making Over $100,000 Per Year.
- |
  

- HOCKEY MOM  pays.
- |
  

- We hear another ding as  SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER  opens the door for  HOCKEY MOM  on her way out.
- |
  

- Outside,  LATTE-SIPPING CROWD  pulls up but doesn't get out of the car.
- |
  

- SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER  remains in the doorway.
- |
  

- "LATTE-SIPPING CROWD: Excuse me, sir?"
- |
  

- I drive a hybrid automobile, so I don't need gas at this time.
- |
  

- However, I wish to purchase a fair-trade latte from your independent, locally owned business.
- |
  

- In exchange, I'll blog about this experience on my Mac.
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: I'm sorry, sir, but we only have Sanka."
- |
  

- You'll have to go to the Starbucks up the street.
- "LATTE-SIPPING CROWD: That's OK."
- |
  

- I was really just being ironic.
- |
  

- Or was I? No, I was.
- |
  

- Sarah Palin is less intelligent than my 3-year-old son, Windward.
- |
  

- LATTE-SIPPING CROWD  speeds off.
- |
  

- SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER  returns to the counter and resumes balancing his books with a concerned look on his face.
- |
  

- Shortly,  JOE THE PLUMBER  emerges from the bathroom holding a diamond-encrusted plunger and a basin wrench made of solid gold.
- |
  

- "JOE THE PLUMBER: Hello, fellow small-business owner."
- |
  

- I'm Joe the Plumber, and I've successfully plumbed your bathroom.
- |
  

- I'm relevant to national politics for some reason.
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: What do I owe you?"
- "JOE THE PLUMBER: More than $250,000 a year."
- |
  

- Despite my name and salary, I'm neither a Mafia boss nor a porn star.
- |
  

- JOE THE PLUMBER  exits the store and drives off in a van made of Stradivarius violins and children's laughter.
- |
  

- Shortly, we hear a ding as  ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER  enters the store.
- |
  

- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: Welcome to my small business, which I own."
- "ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER: Because I'm elderly, I'd like to purchase a case of Tab from your small business."
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: Because this is Middle America, I have the unfashionable beverage that you seek."
- "ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER: Because I'm Jewish, I must first ask whether you're a secret Muslim or Jimmy Carter before I patronize your small business."
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: I'm neither."
- |
  

- Your total is $8.
- |
  

- Will that be credit or debit?
- "ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER: That's a tough decision."
- |
  

- I'm not sure.
- |
  

- I don't like the credit-card company's policies, but my credit card is old and I'm familiar with it.
- |
  

- My debit card promises big benefits, but it's fairly new and has a funny name.
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: You need to make a decision."
- |
  

- Which one will it be?
- "ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER: I'm still undecided."
- |
  

- Why are there people watching me through the store windows?
- "SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER: Those are the evangelicals."
- |
  

- They live next door and work for the credit-card company.
- |
  

- They're watching you to see what you choose.
- |
  

- Now, just slide the card, select either credit or debit, type in your four-digit pin, and select "Yes" when it asks you "Is this amount OK?
- |
  

- The  EVANGELICALS  begin throwing stones at the windows in an effort to distract  ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER .
- |
  

- "ELDERLY JEWISH VOTER: This is too complicated!"
- |
  

- I'm confused by your machines!
- |
  

- Also, your gas prices are through the roof!
- |
  

- Just then,  MEDIA ELITE  pulls up to the station in an armored fighting vehicle, but does not emerge from the hatch.
- |
  

- "MEDIA ELITE: ( Through the vehicle's loudspeaker."
- |
  

- Hello, I'm Media Elite.
- |
  

- I would help, but I can't risk being hit with those stones.
- |
  

- Instead, I'll stay here, 150 percent in the tank.
- "NARRATOR: How will they vote?"
- |
  

- How will it end?
- |
  

- Find out November 4 at theaters everywhere.
