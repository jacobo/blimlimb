- Where were we?

- Oh, we were talking about your sending gift subscriptions of McSweeney's to your friends and family.
- |
  

- You should do this.
- |
  

- Mail a check today, and the recipient will be sent, in time for Christmas, a personally inscribed copy of the first issue -- all 144 glorious, printed-in-Reykjavik pages, complete with a lovely gift card.
- |
  

- "After that, he or she or they will receive three more, with Issue #2 out in mid-February."
- But you have to act today.
- |
  

- If you send a check today, on December 14, the proprietors of McSweeney's will get it in time to fulfill your order before they go to a wedding in San Francisco, then to their cousins' home for a nice Irish Catholic Christmas, celebrated in cable-knit sweaters and among many blond children, the way Jesus intended.
- So.
- |
  

- "Send the $28 to:"
- McSweeney's
- |
  

- A Ninth Street
- Brooklyn, NY
- |
  

- "Note: There are exactly 120 copies -- no more, no less -- of the first issue of Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern still available, so act while you can."
- "Also note: You very well might get your arms caught in a shredder tomorrow, which would make acting much, much more difficult."
- |
  

- So act today.
- "And this: There are also McSweeney's T-shirts."
- |
  

- They will not arrive by Christmas, but will arrive in early January.
- |
  

- "They are $16, and emblazoned, in black type on white cotton, across their chests is this:"
- TIMOTHY
- MCSWEENEY'S
- COTTON UNDERGARMENT
- |
  

- McSweeney's readers have become accustomed.
- That is all.
- |
  

- Act today.
- |
  

- Or right now.
