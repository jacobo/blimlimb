- Sweetheart, I've got you under my skin.
- |
  

- I'll wash and wash, but you'll never come out.
- |
  

- Roses are red, violets are blue.
- |
  

- Sugar is sweet, and I think I left the iron on.
- |
  

- I'm crazy for you!
- |
  

- Get it?
- |
  

- BE MINE.
- |
  

- Wait.
- |
  

- That has six letters.
- |
  

- Six letters is so unlucky.
- |
  

- It's like YOU DIE.
- |
  

- That's exactly what it's like.
- |
  

- Now you're going to die and it's all my fault.
- |
  

- Honey, I'm hot for you!
- |
  

- It's like a fever.
- |
  

- Do you think it's viral meningitis?
- |
  

- I bet it is.
- |
  

- I touched the light switch and who knows what germs were on there.
- |
  

- "Then I thought about you, and infected you\x97it's a viral brain infection, so of course it's transmitted through brain waves, that makes perfect sense."
- |
  

- We should probably just drive to the hospital right now.
- |
  

- You're all I think about.
- |
  

- Literally!
- |
  

- "You and me, sitting in a tree\x97oh, wait, that doesn't sound very safe, does it?"
- |
  

- Let's say we're sitting on a couch instead.
- |
  

- Huh.
- |
  

- I wonder who sat on this couch before us.
- |
  

- Maybe we should put some plastic wrap down.
- |
  

- Yeah, I think we'd better.
- |
  

- Is this a new box of plastic wrap, or has it been opened for a while?
- |
  

- Are you sure?
- |
  

- OK.
- |
  

- OK.
- |
  

- Let's just say it's new and move on.
- |
  

- So we're sitting on a couch, K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
- |
  

- Except that I kind of feel this tingle on my lip?
- |
  

- Like I might be getting a cold sore?
- |
  

- Maybe we should just forget the whole thing.
- |
  

- It's hard to tell, what with all the SSRIs in my bloodstream, but I think I feel something for you.
- |
  

- I'd touch you without gloves.
- |
  

- If I could, I mean.
- |
  

- I love you.
- |
  

- Wait.
- |
  

- That didn't feel right.
- |
  

- Let me try it again.
- |
  

- I love you.
- |
  

- Don't think about disease.
- |
  

- Don't think about disease.
- |
  

- Don't think about disease.
- |
  

- I love you.
- |
  

- There.
