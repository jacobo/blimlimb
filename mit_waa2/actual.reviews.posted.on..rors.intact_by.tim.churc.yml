  Hegel's Philosophy of Freedom, by Paul Franco
  Franco Scores Again!
  Paul Franco once again demonstrates that he is the master of social
  and political
     philosophy. Prof. Franco delves into every corner of Hegel's
  profundity to offer up a
     stunning cautionary tale; beware! Hegel, largely neglected and even
  more
     misunderstood, steers a course independent of the paralysing
  conformity of western
     "liberal" thinking and the totalitarian mysteries of the east; he was
  the last great third
     way. Franco shines a light on this and with bubbling clarity and
  freshness of prose let's
     even the beginning reader in on the secret we've all been missing.

  Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte
  Wuthering Indeed!
  Well as if the Nineteenth Century weren't bad enough we now have
  Penguin shoving it
     down our maws every other day with another re-issue of some tepid
  "classic." Miss
     Bronte has done it again and wielded her magic pen as a wand and cast
  her net of sleep
     on the unsuspecting reading public of America. The only consolation
  the non-preteen
     girl reader can get form this sack of slumber is the final
  realisation that "wuthering" is
     British slang for "your eyelids are getting heavy, why don't you just
  nod off?" I really
     have to say to Miss Bronte that I did not find Garfield's antics
  convincing in the least.

  Turow this one back!
  Reading Scott Turow is like going to Law School; it's in Chicago and
