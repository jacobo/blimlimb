- You have come to me for a design.
- |
  

- But you do not fully grasp my narrative context, my postmodern niche, my dinette oeuvre.
- |
  

- Let me enlighten you.
- |
  

- Superficially, I am a designer of home furnishings.
- |
  

- "But in the klieg-lit world of my imagination I rule a land where creative SWAT teams smash the doors of timid \"usefulness,\" forcing its wretched occupants face-first onto their disgusting utilitarian floors. Yes, I dominate design. I conquer it. I capture it with my lasso and keep it in a corral of my own elaborate and inherently faulty construction. I am the king of design\x97a cowboy king, if you will."
- My designs will challenge you to question your environment, even as you wonder why nothing really works.
- |
  

- My chairs hang from walls.
- |
  

- My spoons are convex.
- |
  

- My knife blades are dull, while their handles are studded with tiny razor-sharp ninja stars.
- |
  

- My soup bowls are cubes (locate the side with the faint indentation before serving), and my plates re-create the precise dimensions of the Marduk ziggurat of Babylon.
- My designs will not bow to the limitations the unimaginative mind places on everyday objects.
- |
  

- Yes, an unimaginative mind much like your own.
- |
  

- Otherwise, why would you implore me to construct your bathtub using conventional materials?
- |
  

- You betrayed your mindless attachment to function when you insisted that the tub hold water.
- Let us give my proposal another look.
- |
  

- "A bathtub constructed solely of chicken wire\x97do you deny the brilliance of this statement?"
- |
  

- The live chickens are a masterstroke.
- |
  

- From its very essence, the tub proclaims my manifesto.
- |
  

- It shouts, "Free yourself from the domineering rule of simplistic function!
- |
  

- Do not be a slave to barren utility!
- |
  

- Avoid stepping on the chickens!
- "\" Join in its cries as you preen beneath the showerhead's thin high-pressure stream, with its convenient preset temperature: scalding."
- You shrink from this proposal.
- |
  

- Will you allow yourself to be tyrannized by an object, insisting on naive, pathetic functionality?
- |
  

- If anyone is going to play tyrant around here, it's me.
- |
  

- And my designs.
- Surely we can bridge this impasse.
- |
  

- Please, sit on my sofa.
- |
  

- It's a daring experiment in comfort and trauma-induced dementia.
- |
  

- Even as its rich rare Italian leather invites you, the motion-sensitive titanium spikes now piercing your thighs defy you to ignore it.
- |
  

- In the coming weeks, as you battle the infection, the excruciating experience will continue to resonate, a painful reminder of the role of design in your life.
- My designs are more than mere furnishings.
- |
  

- Each is a commitment.
- |
  

- "No, more than a commitment\x97a contract."
- |
  

- Really, you must sign this contract, agreeing to a mere dozen or so statutes and subsequent clauses in the use and display of my work.
- Now that we've established a formal business relationship, let me charm you with this amusing anecdote.
- |
  

- One brazen client questioned why my chairs had only three legs.
- |
  

- He prattled on about "falling over.
- "\" Boorish dullard!"
- |
  

- I insist that you remain alert and balanced, never relaxing into the deadly complacency of poor, uninspired design.
- |
  

- He also had the temerity to ask why my chairs lacked arms.
- |
  

- Arms, when I had lavished on his chairs row upon row of chanting animatronic heads!
- |
  

- How this benighted fool ever lived to be 87 is beyond me.
- |
  

- And broken hips are not my responsibility, as the contract clearly states.
- I can see that you find my eyewear disturbing.
- |
  

- No, it's completely harmless, I assure you.
- |
  

- The silver prongs that keep my eyelids pried apart are forged from surgical steel.
- |
  

- I refuse to close my eyes to the designs around me, and I insist that my clients do the same.
- |
  

- You'll get used to the prongs in no time.
- As my client, you must meet some additional requirements, including the attendance of my six-week indoctrination camp.
- |
  

- I refuse to think of you as a consumer.
- |
  

- I prefer the word "disciple.
- "\" Yes, again the contract\x97you agreed to change your full name to \""
- Disciple.
- "\" And to wear only this diaphanous smock."
- |
  

- And to limit urination to once a day.
- |
  

- Disgusting habit.
- Now, Disciple, fetch my evening cape and Stetson, for we must embark upon our promenade.
- |
  

- You'll find on your headgear a small metallic ring for attaching the leash.
- |
  

- Bark, Disciple, bark!
- |
  

- Ha, my little joke.
- |
  

- You needn't bark.
- |
  

- But you do need your wallet.
- Let us pray that our senses are not assailed by an excess of hideous, intellectually insulting, absurdly functional design.
- |
  

- It drives me to a raging, sadistic frenzy.
- |
  

- "At the crack of my whip, Disciple\x97onward!"
- |
  

- And please carry my Chihuahua.
- |
  

- His little blown-glass chaps make it impossible for him to walk.
- |
