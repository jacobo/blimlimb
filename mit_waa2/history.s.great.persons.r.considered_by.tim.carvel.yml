- ELVIS PRESLEY
- It seems to go without saying that Elvis Presley was the greatest celebrity of all time&nbsp;&#151; the original superstar.
- |
  

- He came along at a time when mass media was just forming, and effortlessly blended the various schools of American music into a potent new form that captured the imagination of the baby boomers at just the moment when they were becoming an unparalleled force in the culture.
- |
  

- But let us now consider whether Presley could have been an even  bigger  star.
- |
  

- What if, for instance, in addition to being able to effortlessly meld the various schools of American music, he had also been a brilliant neurosurgeon?
- |
  

- Wouldn't that have made him even  more  renowned?
- |
  

- "Okay, now let's alter the formula somewhat: What if he'd been able to effortlessly meld the various schools of American music, been a brilliant neurosurgeon&nbsp;&#151; BUT, he'd had slightly buck teeth?"
- |
  

- Would he have been more famous, slightly less famous, or exactly the same?
- |
  

- All right.
- |
  

- Now let's start with basic Elvis again.
- |
  

- What if he&nbsp;&#151; instead of Tennessee Williams&nbsp;&#151; had written  A Streetcar Named Desire,  but he'd also been born with lobster-like claws for hands?
- |
  

- Leave aside the question of how he would have written the play&nbsp;&#151; for the sake of argument, let's say he dictated it, or maybe had some sort of special typewriter.
- |
  

- How he wrote the plays isn't important.
- |
  

- The question is, would he have been as widely adored?
- |
  

- More so?
- |
  

- Less so?
- |
  

- Now, what if he'd been able to fly, but had also been a known Communist?
- |
  

- What if he had been the first man on the moon, but had also carried on a highly public affair with Randolph Scott?
- |
  

- What if he'd broken Babe Ruth's hitting record, but had also engaged in uprovoked fisticuffs with Lucille Ball on live national television?
- |
  

- MONICA LEWINSKY
- Whatever you think of her actions, it's difficult not to feel some sympathy for Monica Lewinsky.
- |
  

- The sad fact is that, for the rest of her days, her name will be associated with her actions in the Clinton White House.
- |
  

- "When someone says \"Monica Lewinsky,\" people will always think of oral sex. There is, as I see it, only one way for Miss Lewinsky to change this: By embarking on a multi-state armed-robbery and killing spree."
- |
  

- QUEEN BEATRIX OF THE NETHERLANDS
- It must be a little odd to be Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.
- |
  

- On the one hand, you're the queen, and that's probably pretty nice.
- |
  

- On the other hand, it  is  the Netherlands.
- |
  

- And the thing about being queen is, it's not like you can dream of one day getting a better job.
- |
  

- You can't think to yourself, "Maybe if I went back to grad school, I could&#8230;" or, "You know, it's not too late for me to become a firefighter.
- "\" Nope."
- |
  

- It's queen, queen, queen, right up 'till the day you die.
- |
  

- OPRAH WINFREY
- It seems safe to argue that, were she to choose  Finnegans Wake  for her Book Club, Oprah Winfrey's ratings might suffer slightly.
- |
  

- But how much?
- |
  

- A three percent drop?
- |
  

- Five?
- |
  

- Ten?
- |
  

- Okay, now what if she were to choose  American Psycho ?
- |
  

- Justine ?
- |
  

- The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ?
- |
  

- GERALD FORD
- In pardoning Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford claimed that he was helping to end "America's long national nightmare.
- "\" But perhaps his actions were simply a way of foregoing what would, in the short term, be extraordinarily difficult, but might in the long term have been beneficial for the country&nbsp;&#151; that is, a thorough airing of the Nixonian dirty laundry."
- |
  

- Perhaps a better solution might have been to take Nixon aside, press a wad of bills into his hand, and whisper, "
- You have forty-eight hours to make it to Canada.
- |
  

- Now go, run like the wind!
- |
  

- DR.
- |
  

- LOUIS PASTEUR
- What if Dr. Louis Pasteur hadn't really wanted to be a doctor in the first place?
- |
  

- What if he'd really, really wanted to be a dancer, and his loving but stern father had forced him into medicine as an occupation?
- |
  

- Sure, it's nice to have pasteurized milk and cheese and all &#151; but is it really worth crushing young Lou Pasteur's dream of a life on the stage?
- |
  

- HUGH HEFNER
- In launching  Playboy,  perhaps the smartest thing Hugh Hefner did was in establishing his personality as that of a witty, urbane sophisticate who enjoyed the company of many, many young women.
- |
  

- After all, who knows how many fewer copies the magazine might have sold, had he instead depicted himself as a solitary masturbator?
