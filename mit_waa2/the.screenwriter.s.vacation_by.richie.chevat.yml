- Saturday, July 19
- The kids fought in the car the whole trip up.
- |
  

- Good for establishing character but seven hours is way too much exposition.
- |
  

- Next time we have to start further along in the story.
- |
  

- Plus, their arguments are just too generic.
- |
  

- That old "Your arm is on my side!
- "\" is so clich\xE9d."
- |
  

- With lines like that they could be anybody's kids.
- |
  

- What they need is some kind of cute quirkiness that lets us know their backstory right away.
- |
  

- Couldn't Katie have some kind of nervous tic?
- |
  

- It would be great if she would stare out the window wistfully or bite her nails or react with dread to the word "
- |
  

- The ride just did not provide the hook we need to grab our attention and make us want to know more.
- |
  

- Who are these people?
- |
  

- Where are they going?
- |
  

- What do they hope to get out of a week by the ocean?
- |
  

- Frankly, after an opening sequence like that one, I just don't care.
- As usual, Susie was the only one who provided the kind of detail we need to ground the whole scene with some gritty realism.
- |
  

- Just as we pulled up to the house I told her I'd brought along some work and there was a great close-up when she glared at me.
- |
  

- Good foreshadowing&#8212;signals the beginning of an interesting subplot.
- |
  

- Sunday, Noon
- Big problem&#8212;we're halfway through the second day and still no inciting incident.
- |
  

- I was sure we had one when Timmy fell off the deck and it looked like he was out cold.
- |
  

- A trip to the hospital would have sparked all sorts of conflicts, and maybe even revealed some long-hidden family secrets.
- |
  

- Of course, a kid in a coma might be over the top for a light family comedy, but not for an  As Good As It Gets -style dramedy.
- |
  

- But he was only faking it.
- |
  

- Great tension for a few minutes, but another dead end for the through line.
- |
  

- Sunday, 11 p.m.
- Can't figure out whose story we are telling.
- |
  

- Is it mine or Susie's?
- |
  

- "I thought it was mine, but then after supper she delivered a near perfect tagline: \"Is this a vacation or a story meeting?"
- "\" I can already see it on the poster."
- |
  

- She also delivered the first plot point right on schedule when she refused to have sex with me.
- |
  

- No sex didn't seem to create a crisis for her, but it sure did for me, so I guess this is my story.
- |
  

- Monday
- The second act began taking shape today.
- |
  

- Susie's character arc is really clear and she hammered it home at the beach when she dumped the contents of the cooler in my lap.
- |
  

- She really knows how to raise the stakes!
- |
  

- Plus, it was a great image.
- |
  

- That definitely goes in the trailer!
- There's still the problem of the kids' subplots.
- |
  

- Katie threw up after swallowing too much sea water&#8212;another great visual but it didn't really advance the action.
- |
  

- Tim found a dead crab, which I thought might turn out to be wonderful recurring image, kind of a poignant echo of the main theme.
- |
  

- But then he kept chasing Katie with it and Susie got angry at me for, "just sitting around and not taking any responsibility for what goes on.
- "\" That led to the cooler-dumping episode so I guess the dead crab was a useful device."
- |
  

- "Note: Make Susie's dialogue more convincing."
- |
  

- Tuesday
- Rained all day.
- |
  

- Trapped in the house and the kids were climbing the walls with boredom.
- |
  

- Tried to make some notes, with Tim and Katie screaming at each other and Susie bugging me to find something for them to do.
- |
  

- Finally, some real conflict!
- |
  

- My ignoring her drove Susie into a rage, which brought us exactly to where we were supposed to be&#8212;the point of no return, the halfway point in Act II, where the protagonist has to fully commit himself to the journey.
- What I really needed was a little more adversity, like having the storm turn into a hurricane.
- |
  

- Then in the process of saving the family from drowning, I could have rediscovered the true meaning of love, parenting and the restorative powers of vacationing.
- |
  

- No such luck.
- |
  

- All I could come up with was an old Monopoly set I found in the hall closet.
- |
  

- The board was moldy so Susie wouldn't touch it, Tim said Monopoly was lame and Katie started whining after about forty-five minutes.
- |
  

- This could be a dysfunctional-family art film.
- |
  

- Wednesday
- A montage day.
- |
  

- Hit the beach early, ate at a clam shack, played miniature golf, bought some tacky souvenirs.
- |
  

- Things were going great.
- |
  

- Then it happened&#8212;the second act reversal.
- |
  

- I should have seen it coming.
- |
  

- After all, we were almost on page 90.
- We were getting into the car when Katie looked down at her legs and asked, in that eerily calm  Sixth Sense  way, "Mom, what are these spots?
- "\" Flashback to taking that shortcut to the parking lot."
- |
  

- Close-up of legs brushing innocent-looking green plants.
- |
  

- Jump cut to rash-covered hands holding first-aid book, open to page titled "
- Poison Ivy.
- |
  

- Thursday
- The crisis.
- |
  

- Up all night, itching like mad, taking turns giving the kids Aveeno baths.
- |
  

- Everybody is exhausted, miserable and ready to call it quits.
- |
  

- Is the vacation ruined?
- |
  

- Should we just admit defeat and go home a day early?
- |
  

- Susie and I look at each other across the kitchen table, battered yet unbowed.
- Who am I kidding?
- |
  

- Poison ivy?
- |
  

- A crisis?
- |
  

- That sucks.
- |
  

- A crisis is a shoot-out or a car chase.
- |
  

- I tried driving extra fast when I went out for more Calamine lotion, just in case they were about to close.
- |
  

- Wouldn't you know it?
- |
  

- It was a 24-hour convenience store.
- |
  

- Would an armed hold-up and some hostage-taking be too much to ask for?
- |
  

- Friday
- The climax occurred this morning around page 104.
- |
  

- Susie threw her suitcase toward the minivan and shouted that this was the last vacation she was ever going to take with us.
- |
  

- Tears and everything.
- |
  

- Shot the right way, and with the right music, it had the potential to be devastating.
- |
  

- The kind of star turn actors go nuts for.
- |
  

- Maybe even Oscar-worthy.
- After that, the resolution practically wrote itself.
- |
  

- At the rest stop about three hours later Katie looks up and says, in that cute little girl from  Monsters, Inc.
- |
  

- "\"Hey my itchies are all gone!"
- "\" Then right on cue, Tim looks up from his Gameboy and says, \""
- I had fun.
- |
  

- Are we going back next year?
- Susie turns in her seat, her eyes still red, sighs and says with mock resignation, "I suppose.
- "\" Then, and this is the clincher, she looks at me with that perfect wifely mixture of love, annoyance and contempt and adds, with just the right touch of sarcasm, \""
- If your father can spare the time.
- "\" The perfect button to go out on!"
- |
  

- Pull back, car travels down interstate, disappears in traffic.
- |
  

- Music swells!
- |
  

- Fade to black!
- |
  

- Roll credits!
- |
  

- And what a terrific setup for the sequel!
