- Before Mayor Giuliani went on his rampage against sex shops in New York, brutally reducing their number from 144 to 142, Times Square was a paradise of sleaze, a carnival of smut, a festival of naughty, naughty boys and girls.

- It was the greatest place in the world to spend a weekend if you were drunk, and if you weren't, it was the greatest place in the world to get drunk and spend a weekend.
- |
  

- How do I know all this, you might be asking?
- |
  

- Well, I will tell you.
- I spent most of the 1970s as a tabloid reporter, and my beat was midtown Manhattan.
- |
  

- I have memories, fond, dark, memories of smack and alleys and a never-ending beat box called freedom.
- |
  

- Those were the times when the times were good, when you could buy  The New York Times  for a quarter and spend your time having the time of your life and still be home in time for dinner.
- |
  

- Those were some glorious times, the times I spent in Times Square.
- |
  

- Let me share them with you now in the spirit of sharing.
- |
  

- Let me don that fur coat I used to wear without fear of political reprisal.
- |
  

- Let's you and me get it on, Times-Square-style.
- |
  

- At the corner of 42nd and 5th Avenue, there was a dwarf.
- |
  

- We called him Stewart the Dwarf, because that's what he was.
- |
  

- Stewart juggled sex toys.
- |
  

- Dildos were his specialty.
- |
  

- He could hoist a dozen dildos into the air at once, and keep them up there, all the while spraying the crowd with an array of snappy patter.
- |
  

- "It went something like this: \"Hey yo dildos, juggling dildos, up in the air, dildos dildos."
- "\" My newsroom buddies and I could watch Stewart for hours."
- |
  

- At around 6 PM, he would break out the fruit-flavored creams, ooze them onto his arms and begin juggling whips, which he intermittently cracked at passers-by.
- |
  

- He had a makeshift leather sling that he hung between newspaper boxes, and he'd swing there, making balloon animals out of condoms, handing them to frightened children.
- |
  

- Occasionally, the police would arrest him on some trumped-up vice charge, but the next day, Stewart would be on the sidewalk again, juggling.
- |
  

- "\"Billy Barty bailed me out,\""
- |
  

- I knew a prostitute who went by the name Tristan Isolde.
- |
  

- She was a real dish, and a lady to boot.
- |
  

- One summer, she cut a deal with the guy who ran TKTS and he let her work the booth on alternate Thursdays.
- |
  

- For $35, she offered a mezzanine seat for  Annie  and two hours at the Chelsea Hotel.
- |
  

- Fifty clams got you a balcony seat for  The Tap Dance Kid  and a three-way at Port Authority.
- |
  

- For $100, she would perform the entire soundtrack of  Dreamgirls  in a bathtub, complete with Nell Carter mask.
- |
  

- I was partial to her Mummenschanz special, for obvious reasons.
- |
  

- One night a couple of years ago, I ran into her at a roast-pork joint on the Lower East Side.
- |
  

- She'd been working as a legal secretary, she told me, and was married now, with a kid.
- |
  

- "\"It wasn't the same after  Miss Saigon ,\""
- |
  

- "\"Suddenly, being a prostitute wasn't cool anymore."
- "\"  I sighed and gazed into my rice and beans, thinking, Andrew Lloyd Webber ruined everything."
- |
  

- The Neon Ass, a gay nightclub on 43rd Street, had its special charms.
- |
  

- With your $10 admission fee, you received a gram of fine-grade Peruvian cocaine, a gigolo, a basket of joints, and a choice of flavored PCPs.
- |
  

- From there, you can only guess what happened, but I can tell you that it was pretty hot.
- |
  

- Your actions had no consequences, and it felt like the song would go on forever.
- |
  

- Sometimes, if it was late at night and I was hopped up on greenies, I'd run into a pimp I knew named Lucky Wilbur.
- |
  

- In clothing and bone structure, he greatly resembled Antonio Fargas from  Starsky and Hutch , only his behavior was far less stereotypical.
- |
  

- This may have been because Wilbur traded only in household pets, and not for sexual purposes.
- |
  

- "\"Just around the corner, there's a real fine basset hound for you,\""
- |
  

- "\"Name of Lyman."
- |
  

- A hundred bucks for the weekend, and he won't pee on your slippers.
- "\" I would usually say no to Wilbur, but occasionally I would wake on a gin-soaked morning and find a Cocker curled next to me, or a Persian scratching the leg of my dresser."
- |
  

- "\"I got some of the nicest pussies in town,\""
- |
  

- Wilbur would say.
- |
  

- "\"You can pet them and pet them and they will never get tired and always be your friend, and they love to play with your balls."
- "\" He didn't have much of an ear for euphemism, no matter how obvious."
- |
  

- When I walk past the Disney Stores and the theme restaurants and all the happy families these days, I have to sigh, mostly because I now have a severe respiratory disorder.
- |
  

- The memories come flooding back to me, like floods do when you remember them, and I recall all the strippers, whores, junkies and perverts I knew back in the day.
- |
  

- Some of them are in the pen now, others in the suburbs.
- |
  

- One, who shall remain nameless, is a Congressman from Virginia.
- |
  

- But mostly, they are ghosts.
- The other day, I swear I saw a dwarf out of the corner of my mind's eye.
- |
  

- I turned and shouted "Stewart!
- |
  

- "\" half expecting a dildo to fly past my head."
- |
  

- But it was only a very short man.
- |
  

- He was from Nebraska, and he was taking a photo of a statue of Matt Lauer.
- |
  

- I felt very sad.
- |
  

- The man walked away into the freshly scrubbed Times Square afternoon, and, after a coughing fit that lasted several minutes and nearly killed me, so, reluctantly, did I.
