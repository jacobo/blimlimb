- You do not have to watch TV or buy expensive books or go to psychics to see  angels.

- You can see them.
- |
  

- Everyone can see them.

- This is a secret that many  large companies do not want you to know about.

- "But let me tell you: it is not  that big a deal."
- "Here's how you do it:"
- First you have to be in pain.

- If you are honest with yourself, this should  not be too difficult.
- Then you have to lie down.
- |
  

- Perhaps you have a couch.
- |
  

- That will do.
- Then you have to wait.
- |
  

- Try to cultivate an expectant air about you, one you  think an angel might find welcoming.
- Eventually, one will appear.
- |
  

- You will know when you see something like the  underside of a cow skull, hanging in the air.
- Angels will not say "Fear not" unless they have something very important to  say, which does not happen very often. This is why, when an angel appears to  you, you have to do some work. You have to try not to be afraid. Even if you  are afraid, just withstand it quietly. Do not say out loud, do not even think  to yourself, "I am afraid" or the angel will have to disappear.
- |
  

- This is not  their fault.
- |
  

- It's just the way it is.
- Don't be discouraged.
- |
  

- It may take you many times of doing this before you are  unafraid enough so an angel can hang around.
- When one does show up, say thank you right away.
- |
  

- If you don't know what else  to say, say thank you over and over.
- Now you have seen an angel.
- |
  

- See?
- |
  

- They are everywhere.
- |
  

- They want to help you.
- |
  

- You can ask them for help anytime.
- But the bottom line is, you are still here.
- |
  

- And they are still there.
- Now, get back to work.

  You do not have to watch TV or buy expensive books or go to psychics to see 
  angels. You can see them. Everyone can see them. This is a secret that many 
  large companies do not want you to know about. But let me tell you: it is not 
  that big a deal.
  Here's how you do it:
  First you have to be in pain. If you are honest with yourself, this should 
  not be too difficult.
  Then you have to lie down. Perhaps you have a couch. That will do.
  Then you have to wait. Try to cultivate an expectant air about you, one you 
  think an angel might find welcoming.
  Eventually, one will appear. You will know when you see something like the 
  underside of a cow skull, hanging in the air.
  Angels will not say "Fear not" unless they have something very important to 
  say, which does not happen very often. This is why, when an angel appears to 
  you, you have to do some work. You have to try not to be afraid. Even if you 
  are afraid, just withstand it quietly. Do not say out loud, do not even think 
  to yourself, "I am afraid" or the angel will have to disappear. This is not 
  their fault. It's just the way it is.
  Don't be discouraged. It may take you many times of doing this before you are 
  unafraid enough so an angel can hang around.
  When one does show up, say thank you right away.  If you don't know what else 
  to say, say thank you over and over.
  Now you have seen an angel. See? They are everywhere. They want to help you.  
  You can ask them for help anytime.
  But the bottom line is, you are still here. And they are still there.
  Now, get back to work.
