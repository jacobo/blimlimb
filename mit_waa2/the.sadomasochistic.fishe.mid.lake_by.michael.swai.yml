- Howdy, worthless worms, and welcome to another installment of  The Sadomasochistic Fisherman , the only syndicated late-night fishing program that hurts so good.
- |
  

- Today, we're fishing in desolate Pyramid Lake, California, a barren waste of a place with nothing but highway and desert in every direction.
- |
  

- They say the only fish you can catch here are sour-tasting, miserable bastards made hard by their hellish existence, and that's just what we're looking for.
- Today I've chosen as my craft a small aluminum dinghy I found behind a warehouse.
- |
  

- It's about 6 feet from bow to stern, and the only seat is a splintered strip of what I believe is house siding.
- |
  

- It's about 104 degrees out today, so the metal's heating up nicely.
- |
  

- As always, I've got my black leather assless chaps on, so I'm getting a pretty intense burning sensation in the old rump.
- |
  

- Mmm, yeah, that's nice.
- |
  

- Really grind those metal shavings in there.
- As you can see, I've modified the self-flagellation whip from our crafts segment to serve as my pole today.
- |
  

- All I did was I took the leather strips and bits of glass from the end of the whip and attached them to the grip with some hot glue.
- |
  

- Then I simply ran a line through the hooks we used to hang ourselves from the ceiling for our "waterless scuba dive" last week. Now, this pole here doesn't have a reel, but I prefer to just wrap the line around my forearm; that way, it digs in a bit when the fish pull.
- Now, of course, you could go buy something like this in a store, but I think there's a lot of fun to be had in making your own pole, and all you really need is some time, patience, some barbed wire to punish yourself if you make a mistake, and a big bottle of Bactine.
- |
  

- And then, look, you've got this beauty sinking its lovely teeth into your palm as you grip and cast.
- |
  

- Oh God, yes.
- |
  

- Do it, pole.
- |
  

- More.
- |
  

- Mmmm.
- All right, so, while we're waiting for a bite, let me just tell you a bit about the hooks and lures we'll be using today.
- |
  

- The hook is a specially made German rotary blade, first used by Nazi forces in World War II to extract information from prisoners.
- |
  

- Of course, this is a much smaller version of that, but the 14 rusty spring-loaded blades work much the same way.
- |
  

- As an added feature, they're all carefully positioned to avoid fatally wounding the victim, or, in our case, the smallmouth bass.
- For bait today, I'm using just some night crawlers I had nailed to the wall a few feet away from a mound of moist soil in my garden shed.
- |
  

- I've kept them alive, since the wriggling helps attract the fish, but I've soaked them in bitters overnight.
- |
  

- You can usually get bitters from your local liquor store, and, I'll tell you, the fish just hate it.
- |
  

- To mask that, I've got some store-bought fish lure on there, which I've spiked with a powerful laxative.
- Ooh, looks like we've got a bite!
- |
  

- Boy howdy, he's a rascal!
- |
  

- That's right, you little maggot, pull!
- |
  

- Pull!
- |
  

- Oh God, yes.
- |
  

- Oh, you like that?
- |
  

- You like that, you little fish piece of crap?
- |
  

- Mmm, yeah, gimme more.
- |
  

- That's it.
- |
  

- Make it hurt .
- |
  

- All right!
- |
  

- Well, that was a tough bout there, but it looks like we won the day.
- |
  

- And, see, you can tell by the grimacing expression on the fish's face, he didn't like those bitters at all.
- |
  

- And see the blades there, all popping out at different angles?
- |
  

- It's amazing, but this little guy can live for up to six hours with those blades in.
- |
  

- So, let's watch, shall we?
- That's right, flop.
- |
  

- Just flop away, boy.
- |
  

- Mmm.
- |
  

- As you can see, I've done a little set dressing here around the fish.
- |
  

- I've just put up some framed photos of other fish, possible family members, what have you, and some glasses of lake water.
- |
  

- The trick is to put everything  just  out of reach, so you get the most vigorous flopping out of your bass.
- |
  

- Oops!
- |
  

- There goes the laxative!
- |
  

- Well, he's flopping pretty good now, so I'm going to manually pleasure myself.
- |
  

- Join us next week, when we convince a marlin that his wife has been killed by a carbon monoxide leak.
