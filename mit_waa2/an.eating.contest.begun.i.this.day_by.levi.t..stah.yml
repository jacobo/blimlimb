  It began simply. My friend Bob ate two baskets of Norris Fries (note: 
  Norris Fries are fries from Norris). That was an unprecedented 
  feat.  Telephone calls were made.  Beads of sweat on his forehead were 
  wiped by perfumed handkerchiefs.
  Seeing the look of intense satisfaction on his face, I decided to top 
  him.  I ate three boxes of Cap'n Crunch.  Of course, that included the 
  boxes, and the plastic whistles.  I saved the UPCs.
  Bob upped the ante considerably by attending a magic show at a grade-school 
  library and eating one hundred doves that flew out of the magician's cape. 
  The children squealed with delight, but were disappointed when the magician 
  ran out of doves. Suggestions that Bob eat him as well went unheeded. 
  Instead, a post-pubescent 6-year-old named Hank ate him.
