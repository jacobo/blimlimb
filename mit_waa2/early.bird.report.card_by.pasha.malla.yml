  EARLY BIRD REPORT CARD
   Student: Lindsay Atkins
   Grade: 2
   Teacher: Mr. Pasha Malla
  Writing and Expression of Ideas: 
   Yes, well "expression" is all relative, isn't it? If expressing oneself entails butchering the English language into a vague 
  sequence of pictograms and reversed letters, then Lindsay is a regular Descartes. Sadly, however, on the Planet Earth we tend to 
  use syntactical constructions to create meaning; "Likes my dad mom ponies," for example, while a vague approximation of something 
  approaching a sentence, seems more the sort of pidgin nonsense spouted by drunken frat boys and the mentally insane. Grade: F.
  Spelling: 
   Oh, if only we could get through life using only words ending in "at." A world of cats, hats, bats, and mats would be a 
  marvellous place, wouldn't it, Lindsay? Marvellous, certainly, but also logistically inconceivable. How a seven-year-old translates 
  "dog" into "B-U-G" is beyond me. "Oh, Daddy, can we take the bug for a walk?" No. Grade: D+.
  Math: 
   Let's try this again: six to the root power of three equals? Equals? Five? Grade: F.
  Reading Skills: 
   The use of the word "skills" here is relative. Compared to, say, a newborn child or a raccoon, 
  Lindsay is a remarkably proficient reader. However, the memorization of three pages of Wacky Wednesday will never 
  qualify anyone for a second-grade reading credit in my class. Did Lindsay even look at the copy of Joyce's The Dead 
  I passed out at the beginning of term? Grade: D-.
  Science:
   From Lindsay's Ptolemaic diagram of the solar system, I take it that, for whatever ungodly reason, there remain a few foolish 
  cynics who ignore five hundred years of science, satellite photographs, and irrefutable astronomic evidence of a heliocentric universe. 
  No, Lindsay, the planets do not revolve around the earth, and this class does not revolve around you. Grade: F.
  Arts: 
   The first class project of the year entailed covering a balloon with papier mach&eacute;, and from this shape forming some make of puppet. 
  Certainly not my choice, but I am apparently rendered powerless once Ms. Morrow steps into the classroom&#8212;she with her unshaven armpits
