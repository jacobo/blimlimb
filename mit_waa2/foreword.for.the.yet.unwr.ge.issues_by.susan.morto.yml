- Then I might have a clue as to the direction this foreword should take.

- But no, I know nothing about this book except that it hasn't been written.

- And it's not like I can ask the supposed author.
- |
  

- No. She's too sensitive.
- |
  

- She's too much of an artiste.
- |
  

- She's too busy to answer questions about her own book.
- |
  

- She doesn't like it when her friends vent their frustration from needy, guilt-infused lunches by cursing the emotionally retarded, passive-aggressive  f*#%wit  and his clingy mother.

- MOTHERF*#%ER!
- |
  

- Screw this foreword!

- "At least the title of the book is right (like it'll ever get written)\x97Leah is a delicate  f*#%ing  flower!"
