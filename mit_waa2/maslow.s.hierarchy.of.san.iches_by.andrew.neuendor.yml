- When enough financial security has been achieved, meat can be slapped on top of what was previously a rudimentary meal.

- Peanut Butter and Jelly
- Once stability arrives, people naturally pine for the comfort and intimacy offered by relationships.

- Few things belong together like peanut butter and jelly, which, when placed face to face, meld like an almost sexual union of opposites.

- Sticky and sweet no longer compete, but instead congeal into a mortar that warms the roof of the mouth while plugging the gaps in the heart's levee.

- Reuben
- Social and familial bonding, though important foundations, can only take people so far.

- Enter the Reuben, which fuels esteem and self-worth with its layered, cornfed meats and melted cheeses.

- The sandwich sizzles on the grill like a Dionysian figure keeping his cool as he skates across Hades' fiery lake.
- |
  

- The Reuben is so confident that it sports sauerkraut without fear of reprisal from finicky eaters.

- The sandwich for self-composed delicatessen-goers who order and eat while selling stocks on cell-phone headsets and slipping business cards into the pockets of attractive people 20 years their junior.
- "S T A G E \xA0 F I V E"
- Muffuletta
- When the needs provided by conventional sandwiches have all been satisfied, people begin to seek the whole loaf, which is ample enough to support a complex amalgam of ingredients, including layers of provolone, salami, and ham.
- |
  

- Additionally, the muffuletta's olive-salad spread, a mixture of 13 ingredients, unites and surrounds the meat and cheese like a salty oversoul.
- |
  

- A product of America's melting pot, the muffuletta is a global sandwich large enough to feed a table full of hungry immigrants who can set aside their differences and break bread in recognition of their common humanity.
- |
  

- The muffuletta does not exist as a result of the stomach's emptiness, but was born from the fullness found deep inside us all.
