  (The songs "A Puzzlement" and "I Whistle a Happy Tune" are sitting in a
  dimly-lit bar on Tenth Avenue in the 40's.)
  "A Puzzlement":  I made Yul Brynner. I made him, and look what I get for
  
  my troubles: a remake of the wrong goddamn version of the story.
  "I Whistle a Happy Tune": But look on the bright side, Puzz -- we're all
  in
  the same boat. You, me, "Shall We Dance," "Something Wonderful," "Hello
  Young
  Lovers" -- none of us is out cashing 20th Century Fox checks.
  "Puzzlement": Yeah, but I don't even want to know how many of you are
  working Streisand's New Year's Eve show in Vegas. (Takes sip of drink.
  Suddenly:) Jodie Foster can kiss my ass!
  "Whistle": Aww, Puzz... Hey, look on the bright side -- Christmas is
  right
  around the corner. Sugarplums. Presents. Yuletide festivities.
  "Puzzlement": Yul-tide festivities. That phrase mocks me. (Motions to
  bartender for refill)
  Bartender: I'm gonna have to cut you off, song.
  "Puzzlement": Go ahead. (Produces a vial of pills) I always have my
  dolls.
  My beautiful dolls... (Swallows a handful) (Weepy:) Someone called from
  ASCAP
  last week to see if I was still alive. My last royalty check was for
  twelve
  cents. I can't even buy my kid a Christmas present.
  "Whistle": Thank God we get revived regionally.
  "Puzzlement": Face it, Whistle: I'm considered novelty. Not a standard.
  But I'm the goddamn father of rap is what I am! But does Puff Dandy know
  who
  I am? The Beasting Boys? The Notorious B.I.G.?
  "Whistle": The Notorious B.I.G. is dead, Puzz.
  "Puzzlement": And so am I. Dead as vaudeville. (Sobs, falls over on bar)
  "Whistle:" Oh, Puzz.... (Running her fingers through Puzzlement's hair)
  Maybe if you ....added a little melody.
  "Puzzlement": I'll look after my own goddamn melody, thank you very
  much!
  "Whistle": Hey, I was only trying to--
  (Suddenly a brawl breaks out at the other end of the bar, instigated by
  one
  particularly haggard-looking song.)

  "Whistle":  Oh, that's the incidental music from New Faces of 1946.
  Remember him? Never worked a day in his life again.
  "Puzzlement": Kill me when I'm that far gone.
  "Whistle": Well, to tell you the truth, Puzz, you're not that far off.
  "Puzzlement": (Volcanic) Why, you--! ("Puzzlement" lunges at "Whistle"
  and
  rips off "Whistle'"s 3/4 time signature, revealing that she's actually
  written in 2/4 time)
  "Whistle": You... filthy... little... piece of songsprecht!
  "Puzzlement": Happy now?
  "Whistle": (Erupts in tears) No, I'm not. I'm a big fake. Oh, the things
  
  you don't know about me.... I've been addicted to laudanum ever since
  our
  Broadway run. Oscar Hammerstein used to beat me. Deborah Kerr tried to
  flush
  my sheet music down a toilet in Bangkok. Oh, I'm a mess, an absolute
  mess.
  What's worse, I could have really used some movie money. ("Puzzlement"
  looks
  questioningly) I'm carrying "Getting to Know You"'s child.
  "Puzzlement":  Oh, jeez, kid, I had no idea. (A beat) So what's a couple
  of
  holiday orphans like us to do?
  "Whistle":  I was thinking -- maybe we oughtta break into the Christmas
  carol
  market.

  "Whistle": So? "Silent Night"? He's no uptempo jazzfest.
  "Puzzlement":  For your information, "Silent Night" has fellated every
  arranger and musical director from here to Century City.
  "Whistle":  I hear he hired his own publicist, too.
  "Puzzlement":  "Silent Night" sleeps in a pile of dirt.
  "Whistle":  Right next to "Rudolph the Red Light District"!  (They
  laugh, and
  clink their empty glasses together) (A beat) But we gotta fight the good
  
  fight, Puzz! There're carolers who need us! Whaddya say?
  "Puzzlement":  Well....(Long pause) OK, I'm in.
  (They stumble out onto the street and find a group of carolers singing
  "Deck
  the Halls." Among the carolers' ranks is a Santa. "Whistle" joins in the
  
  singing enthusiastically, while "Puzzlement" stands on the sidelines,
  looking
  on. The song ends; "Puzzlement" sidles over to Santa.)
  "Puzzlement":   Hello, Big Boy. (Looks Santa up and down) How would you
  feel
  about... getting bald?
