- HO HO
- BY ALLEN GINSBERG
- Wear your red suit and your boots
- And that repulsive white beard
- With the hardened saliva of sick nights in countless tenements,
- That same red suit you bought at Woolworth's
- With the money you made
- From the flesh of the elves.
- From their blood and their sweat
- And their flesh that would scream if it had a voice,
- Their tiny cries are not heard
- Because of the jingle bells.
- And your twisted sick appetite
- That feeds on the young with
- Firm buttocks.
- And that "elf look.
- Damn you, you big fat man in a red suit.
- Goddamn you, you grotesque fat man with
- Inflamed loins.
- Your sickness is the sickness
- Of the flesh merchant,
- The Industrial man who lives
- Above the elves.
- Oh, damn you,
- And your sick enchained animals with antlers!
- Reindeer Girl
- BY SYLVIA PLATH
- On this month they call December,
- On this street of filth,
- A girl with her latest suitor
- Is walking through the filthy snow
- Piled on the sidewalks by the still-eyed men
- Who call her "slut"
- From their wretched street-sweeper machines.
- And she hears the sound
- Of Jack Frost nipping at her nose
- And the man next to her
- Drunkenly stumbles along
- Thinking of a television set
- That he saw in a window surrounded by fake snow
- And the falsehood she has walked through
- Her whole reindeer life, daddy.
- Oh, Curse this idiot and his television.
- Oh, father!
- Curse your life with your driveway!
- And your brick barbeque pit
- And your American wet saliva
- That sticks to your disgusting American face
- With Perry Como in it
- With a green face
- Because they cannot get
- The "tone" control right.
- The Jingle Bells
- BY EDGAR ALLAN POE
- Hear the jingle bells!
- Hear them jingle!
- How they jingle!
- How they jangle!
- And see the madman in the red suit!
- Who is coming!
- He sees you!
- With wide wild eyes.
- He wants you!
- He sees you when you sleep!
- He knows what mad dances
- The reindeer make!
- How they twirl and touch their antlers!
- How their blood is stirred
- By the madman they call Claus!
- How merry they are
- As they drink your blood and say,
- "\"Merry Christmas to all,"
- And to all a good night!
- You are their daughter!
- My love!

  From their blood and their sweat
  And their flesh that would scream if it had a voice,
  Their tiny cries are not heard

  Reindeer Girl
  BY SYLVIA PLATH
  On this month they call December,
  On this street of filth,
  A girl with her latest suitor
  Is walking through the filthy snow
  Piled on the sidewalks by the still-eyed men
  Who call her "slut"
  From their wretched street-sweeper machines.
  And she hears the sound
  Of Jack Frost nipping at her nose
  And the man next to her
  Drunkenly stumbles along
  Thinking of a television set
  That he saw in a window surrounded by fake snow
  And the falsehood she has walked through
  Her whole reindeer life, daddy.
  Oh, Curse this idiot and his television.
  Oh, father!
  Curse your life with your driveway!
  And your brick barbeque pit

  That sticks to your disgusting American face
  With Perry Como in it
  With a green face
  Because they cannot get
  The "tone" control right.
