- |
  

- Be cool.

- |
  

- But!
- "Larry: Trust me."
- |
  

- I know about Fitzsimmons.
- |
  

- I've heard some things.
- "Max: Things, Larry?"
- |
  

- Things?
- |
  

- Well, excuse me, Larry.
- |
  

- Do you hear me, Larry?
- |
  

- We need this raise, Larry.
- |
  

- Oh, my God, do we need this raise, Larry.
- "Larry:  (smirking, relaxed)  Yes, Max, we do."
- |
  

- By the way, I slept with your girlfriend.

- |
  

- A pristine energy flows through me.
- |
  

- Can you feel it?
- |
  

- I have tremendous love for life.
- |
  

- So, what can I do for you boys?

- May I call you Arch?
- "Fitzsimmons:  (stone-faced)  No."
- |
  

- Laugh track.
- |
  

- "Larry: Pow."
- |
  

- Anyway, Arch, Max and I need some more dead presidents, if you know what I'm saying.
- "Max:  (frantic, sweating, grabbing)  No, sir, see, what he means, sir, is &#151;"
- "Fitzsimmons: Go easy, Pendleton."
- |
  

- I know what he means.
- "Max:  (confused)  You do, sir?"
- "Fitzsimmons:  (rising from his chair)  Yes, and it is an outrage!"
- "Max: Sir?"
- |
  

- Please, sir!
- |
  

- Oh, God.
- "Fitzsimmons: I've read your reports; I've seen the numbers in your spreadsheets; I've crouched beside your cubicles and eavesdropped on personal phone conversations; I've been apprised of your behavior at Ann Baxter's retirement party; I've found your college transcripts in the copy machine; I've witnessed your blatant misuse of company-supplied Blackberry handheld devices; I've overheard your sarcastic men's room commentary."
- "Max: Those were your wingtips in the farthest stall?"
- |
  

- Laugh track.
- |
  

- "Fitzsimmons: You two are the biggest goofballs this company has ever seen."
- |
  

- Clean out your desks, gentlemen, I want you gone by the time I get back from lunch.
- |
  

- FITZSIMMONS storms out of the office.
- |
  

- A beat.
- |
  

- "Larry: That went well."
- |
  

- Max breaks into tears.
- |
  

- Laugh track.
