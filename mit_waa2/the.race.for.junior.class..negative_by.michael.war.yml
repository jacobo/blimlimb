- "The video opens with a candidate leaning against a table in a classroom and speaking into the camera:"
- I'm Dan Lettich, and I approved this message.
- |
  

- There's only one candidate for junior-class vice president who has actual experience working in student government.
- |
  

- My opponent Mary Zwerdling claimed in the last debate that she worked on student government freshman year, but the fact is, there is no record of it.
- |
  

- Even our school newspaper, the  Weekly Warrior , could not find evidence of her doing anything related to student government freshman or sophomore year other than making brownies for a bake sale.
- |
  

- Next time you see Mary in the hall, ask her to start telling the truth about her record.
- |
  

- "The video opens with a grainy yearbook picture of Dan on a black background and ominous music playing:"
- There goes Dan Lettich again, distorting the facts and going negative.
- |
  

- Maybe it's because he has such a troubling record.
- |
  

- Freshman year, Dan spent three days in detention for spitball-related incidents and one day in detention for slapping a female student on the behind.
- |
  

- Mary Zwerdling, on the other hand, has always been a student who does what's right.
- |
  

- She has never had detention, and she won the award for the student with the best  attendance record freshman year.
- |
  

- That's the kind of integrity and dedication we need.
- |
  

- Not bad behavior and negative attacks.
- I'm Mary Zwerdling, and I approved this message.
- |
  

- "The video opens on a handwritten note with several sentences highlighted and the same sentences in printed text on the screen below it:"
- It seems that Mary Zwerdling has been paying attention to more than just trigonometry in third period.
- |
  

- In a top-secret note that Mary recently attempted to pass to another student in the class, she wrote, "Adam Toll gave me a hickey the other day.
- |
  

- He's so cute, but I don't know if I like him like him, or if I just like him.
- "\" Mary Zwerdling gets a hickey and then can't decide whether she likes the guy who gave it to her?"
- |
  

- Is this the kind of indecisiveness we want in our junior-class vice president?
- |
  

- Dan Lettich has been dating his girlfriend for four whole months.
- |
  

- That's the kind of decisiveness and stability we need in a leader.
- I'm Dan Lettich, and I approved this message.
- |
  

- "The video opens with a panning shot across cheering teens in the stands next to a football field and continues panning as if searching for someone throughout the voice-over:"
- Where was Dan Lettich at the big game against the Wildcats last week?
- |
  

- The entire school was there to cheer on our Warriors in their glorious triumph.
- |
  

- But where was Dan?
- |
  

- Did he have something better to do?
- |
  

- If only that were the case.
- |
  

- The fact is that Dan was grounded for taking his parents' car and driving it to a friend's house the night before, even though he only has a learner's permit.
- |
  

- He breaks the law, violates his parents' trust, and doesn't come to the biggest game of the year.
- |
  

- And now he wants to be our vice  president?
- |
  

- Tell him no way.
- |
  

- You're voting for Mary instead.
- I'm Mary Zwerdling, and I approved this message.
- |
  

- "The video opens with a boy in goggles standing in front of some beakers and a lit Bunsen burner:"
- Hey, I'm Jason Goldberg.
- |
  

- Are you as burned out as I am with the constant attack ads that Mary and Dan keep firing back and forth?
- |
  

- Sure, I may not be as cool or as popular as either of them, and I may not be head of any teams or clubs, but I'm a regular guy, just like you.
- |
  

- And I want to light a fire under our student government to make sure our prom is the hottest prom in the county.
- |
  

- So forget about Mary and Dan.
- |
  

- Together, we can spark the kind of change the junior class really needs.
- |
  

- I'm Jason Goldberg, and I approved this message.
