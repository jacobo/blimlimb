- I'd heard about Tim but had never met him.
- |
  

- The word was he could help.
- Most of my friends sold copiers or shoes or mocha lattes, but Tim dealt in hours, sometimes minutes, never days.
- |
  

- I was having a problem with a particular hour.
- |
  

- I could name when it was going to occur.
- |
  

- And what exactly I wanted to happen.
- |
  

- So I needed Tim.
- Finally I managed to get his number through an acquaintance and ring him.
- |
  

- He said he'd stop by that very evening.
- When I opened the door I guess I was expecting someone in a cape, or at least wearing something shiny and blue.
- |
  

- But Tim wore jeans, glasses, was tallish and thin.
- |
  

- He looked like someone I'd have a crush on in college.
- It was Octobery out, nippy and acornish and orange-black.
- |
  

- I asked Tim to come in.
- |
  

- Tim declined a beer, nor did he want coffee or crackers and cheese.
- |
  

- Tim wasn't a wine drinker either and politely refused a juice box.
- |
  

- The cocktail olives were waved away.
- |
  

- He sat and encouraged me to tell my story.
- I had been in a relationship in the spring.
- |
  

- It was very happy until it wasn't.
- |
  

- Part of the happy time fell over that one Sunday in April when the country "springs forward" and loses an hour at two o'clock in the morning.
- Tim nodded.
- |
  

- He'd heard my story before.
- I continued.
- |
  

- That hour, that lost hour from those thrilling spring days, was going to show up this Sunday at two o'clock in the morning, as it always does on a Sunday at the end of October.
- "My question: could I have that hour back with that special someone?"
- Tim's face knotted.
- |
  

- He wanted to know if my ex and I had been in Arizona or Indiana over that Sunday in April.
- |
  

- As anyone who reads the papers is aware, neither Arizona nor Indiana observes Daylight Savings.
- |
  

- These two places do not spring forward or fall back but rather just stay put, doing whatever sort of basketballish, cactusy things these states do.
- |
  

- Their refusal to participate generally confuses the rest of the country but everyone puts up with it because we must.
- No, my beau and I had not been in either state at the time, I confirmed.
- |
  

- Nor had we been in Newfoundland, which is always 30 minutes ahead of the Canadian Maritime provinces, another baffling idea but clearly Nova Scotia's problem, not mine.
- Tim thought for a moment and then asked for my ex's name.
- |
  

- He told me where to meet them, and departed.
- |
  

- He didn't have to tell me the date and time.
- Two in the morning arrived that late October Sunday and I marched into the pancake house, the only place open, looking just terrific&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;lipsticked, hair done, the works.
- |
  

- My ex glowered in the last booth.
- |
  

- Tim sat in the next room, constantly syruping an icy waffle.
- I was delighted to see my ex.
- |
  

- We had that lost hour back from April!
- |
  

- Joy.
- Sitting down, I began to chat about topics from the spring, films we'd seen, friends.
- |
  

- My ex chewed on a sprig of parsley.
- |
  

- I told my former love how great it was we had this one last hour together.
- |
  

- My ex ordered a water.
- |
  

- I made a flower out of a napkin.
- |
  

- My ex wouldn't even look.
- When the hour was over, my former paramour paid half the bill and slunk out the door.
- Tim put down the syrup pitcher and approached my booth.
- I cried a bit.
- |
  

- Tim, I asked, do you think things are better in Arizona and Indiana?
- Tim said he thought they might be, and smiled.
- |
  

- He was cute, but I knew not to like him.
- |
  

- Tim had other hours to give back to too many people for as many reasons as there are seconds in one of our days.
- Before he left, Tim reminded me that sometimes, clocks and calendars be damned, one must spring forward.
- Don't let dates get you down, he said over his shoulder, meaning, I think, two things at once.
