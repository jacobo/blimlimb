- "Following the devastating disintegration of Sockhop Babykill Redux, I made a fatal error: I searched for truth in a bottle."

- A foolish mistake, to be sure, especially given that truth, as you and I know, is only to be found in a few certain brain-liquefying chord progressions, the shrieks of an unruly, bloodthirsty crowd, and interesting, dynamic lighting sets.
- Following the events of last summer, I grew more despondent, more dependent on alcohol for sustenance.
- |
  

- The nadir of my imbibement-induced atrophy occurred one night last August, when the sticky summer air was dripping with fate, bad luck, and moisture.
- |
  

- Already drunk, I had made my way down to Al's Beer Place, a degraded hall of debauchery that makes a Klan meeting look like a daycare center.
- "\"Yo, Daniel!"
- "\" I heard as I walked in."
- |
  

- It was Jed, a hulking pork chop of a man, the sort of massive flesh-mountain for whom the phrase "
- |
  

- "\" was invented."
- "\"It's Deathblow,\""
- |
  

- I reminded him.
- "\"OK, Deathblow,\""
- |
  

- "\"Hey, Deathblow\x97have you ever done a J\xE4ger bomb?"
- I woke up three months later in the middle of an Iowa cornfield.
- |
  

- The clothes I had on were not my own.
- |
  

- There was a cryptic sign reading "USED TYPEWRITER" taped to my stomach. On the inside of my right thigh was a small tattoo of an anteater. It took me several months to get home, during which I was forced, due to my lack of resources, to perform all manner of unsavory acts on a veritable menagerie of the Midwest's most profane, mouth-breathing denizens. It was on a particularly barren stretch of I-80  that I was compelled to sell a song in exchange for a ride from a heavyset trucker who referred to himself as Frito. As he pulled into the fast lane, I explained to him that, lacking my guitar, I would have to sing a cappella; and with that I launched into a soul-hammering, accompaniment-free version of "God's Filthy Stepson and the Succubus's Flea Market.
- "\" Frito quickly cut me off."
- "\"All right, get out of my truck."
- "\"What?"
- |
  

- Why?
- "\" Had I rocked Frito so hard, had I shaken his spine with such fury, that several synapses had become detached and, in his confusion, he was now acting directly against his own self-interest?"
- "\"That song."
- |
  

- It makes me want to kill myself.
- "\"But I\x97\""
- "\"Do you know 'American Pie'?"
- "\"You see\x97\""
- "\"One more time: Do."
- |
  

- You.
- |
  

- Know.
- |
  

- American.
- |
  

- Pie.
- You would not be wrong to judge me, Diary, for humoring the contemptible Frito in his desire to hear a piece of tawdry Americana so horrifically trite that an angel of rock is surely felled every time it's crooned.
- |
  

- But, at the same time, I was low on options.
- |
  

- So I sang it, as per his request.
- |
  

- And then again.
- |
  

- And again.
- |
  

- But four hours later I had made precious progress toward Virginia, and for this I was thankful.
- The hour grows late, friend.
- |
  

- I shall continue filling you in tomorrow.
- |
  

- "I am refreshed, Diary\x97refreshed and ready to finish my tale."
- |
  

- I finally reached Richmond last night.
- |
  

- Exhausted, I rang the doorbell, and my mother answered in a ratty nightgown and more curlers than she has strands of hair.
- "\"Daniel,\""
- |
  

- "\"Deathblow."
- "\"OK."
- |
  

- Deathblow.
- "\"I'm home, Mother."
- "\"I can see that."
- |
  

- Sorry I didn't accept any of your collect calls.
- "\" She produced a cigarette, took a long drag."
- |
  

- The smoke hung in the air like the singeing exhalations of a dragon (or perhaps a wyvern, if wyverns breathe fire).
- |
  

- "\"But the important thing is that you're home."
- "\" I brushed passed her, wanting nothing more than to collapse onto my bed."
- "\"Oh, and Dan\x97I mean Deathblow?"
- "\" I hadn't even reached the stairs."
- "\"Yes, Mother?"
- "\"I sold your guitar on eBay because it, uh, reminded me of you."
- My world began to swim.
- |
  

- I grabbed the banister for support, ready to spin around and deliver onto my mother a smorgasbord of invectives that would have left even the most scatologically inclined diner sated.
- |
  

- But no.
- |
  

- Not this time.
- |
  

- Somewhere, there was a mountain of ash consisting of all the bridges I had burned since Sockhop Babykill Redux had gone down.
- |
  

- I did not intend on adding to its sorry mass.
- "\"That's ."
- |
  

- OK, Mother.
- |
  

- I guess I'll have to buy another one.
- "\" And with that I trudged upstairs to the comfort of my room and the catharsis of my beloved diary."
- |
  

- I'm in a transitional phase, Diary.
- |
  

- "A couple weeks ago I ran into my former lover, Gaping Axe Wound, n\xE9e Festering Axe Wound."
- |
  

- She's managing a Wendy's and told me they'd just lost a full-time employee to a horrific Frosty-making accident.
- |
  

- She offered me the position, and, having no better options, I accepted.
- |
  

- So I now spend my days shoveling burgers into the maws of the grease-spotted masses.
- |
  

- It is a sad, lonely existence, made all the more sad and lonely by Gaping Axe Wound's continual, oppressive presence.
- My plight reminds me of my greatest song, the 49-minute opus "Lars Demonslay and the Stallion of Eternity.
- "\" I know, I know\x97you assume I'm referring to the opening operetta, in which Lars discovers his ethereal powers after a lumberjacking accident in northern Scandinavia; I can see the connection."
- |
  

- But really I feel more like Lars 20 years later, when he's fighting Mol'Gruth, Undoer of Dreams, in the icy, labyrinthine Destiny's Palace.
- |
  

- Just as Lars must look within himself (more specifically, within his Heart of Fate, which he won from Thor thanks to a clever bet) to defeat the Lord of the Demons, I must find my own Heart of Fate, so to speak, with which to break out of this everyman's nightmare.
- |
  

- I am no everyman, Diary.
- |
  

- "Mark my words: I will return to that which I feel is probably my birthright."

  Many months have passed since I last planted the seeds of history in your fertile pages, Diary.
