- I have a dollhouse.
- |
  

- My mother got it for me at a yard sale.
- |
  

- It's  blue and the inside of it is white, except I painted some of the  rooms with light watercolors.
- |
  

- It's a very big, primitive dollhouse,  like a cave.
- |
  

- Some of the doorways are broken.
- There are no stairs so I took an old phone receiver with the cord  hanging off of it, and I made the receiver into a bed with the cord  hanging down as a spiral ladder.
- |
  

- My dolls can climb up and down the  ladder.
- |
  

- Sometimes they get in fights and one doll will push another  doll off the ladder two stories down to the ground.
- I think the phone is really comfortable to sleep on because of all  the buttons on it.
- I wish that I could shrink and live in my dollhouse.
- |
  

- I read books  about people shrinking and living in dollhouses.
- |
  

- Or people who are  already small and live in dollhouses.
- "My doll family: John, father."
- |
  

- Susan, mother.
- |
  

- Lucy, age 12.
- |
  

- David,  age 11.
- |
  

- Marian, 10.
- |
  

- Eleanor, 9. Michael, 3. Aster, 2. The Baby, 1.  They have to share bedrooms.
- |
  

- Times are hard but there is always  plastic bread, and some oranges and bananas, and some meat, some  muffins, and soda.
- |
  

- And they have toys that I have collected for them.
- |
  

- I made them a toybox out of posterboard cut up into squares and taped  together into a cube.
- |
  

- And sometimes they have She-Ra.
- |
  

- With a shaven  head she is their tough, butch, older sister.
- |
  

- She lives away from  home but she comes to visit sometimes.
- Lucy is the luckiest and the most incongruous in the family.
- |
  

- She  is china with blond hair and flouncy pink Victorian-era skirts and  pantalets.
- |
  

- Next to her, they all look like refugees.
- |
  

- But she is  really nice and acts in a responsible, mature manner behooving the  eldest child.
- |
  

- She has problems sitting down, though, because her  skirts get in the way.
- David is active and quick.
- |
  

- He picks on Eleanor too much, pushing  her off the ladder or ignoring her.
- |
  

- He likes to play with Marian.
- |
  

- Everyone likes to play with Marian.
- Marian is beautiful and kind, if bossy.
- |
  

- Nature has rendered her an  invalid.
- |
  

- Her rubber legs are snapped off at the knee.
- |
  

- As surgeon I  have jammed them back together with pins.
- |
  

- She is fortunate enough,  however, to have a beautiful yellow dress that matches her yellow  hair, which has a red painted bow in it.
- |
  

- Because of their physical  similarity she and Lucy like to play together.
- Eleanor is quiet and shy and plain.
- |
  

- She is an orphan.
- |
  

- She came  from the street.
- |
  

- She has red shoes.
- |
  

- She doesn't bend well so she has  to stand up all the time, or lie down flat.
- |
  

- Her pink dress is  homemade.
- |
  

- She helps look after the babies.
- |
  

- The babies are not much  worth mentioning.
- |
  

- They consist mainly of cry and demand.
- John and Susan lie together in bed on top of the sheets, side by  side, staring up at the ceiling.
- |
  

- John wears his suit and tie.
- |
  

- Susan  wears her ragged checked wraparound skirt and sleeveless top that I  made for her from a box of scraps.
- |
  

- Above them a brown spider crawls  on the ceiling.
- |
  

- The spider is going to have spiderlets.
- My dollhouse is in the corner of my room in front of the radiator.
- |
  

- Balls of dust roll silently around the house like clouds during the  night when I sleep and the day when I am in school.
- |
  

- I come home and  make a patchwork quilt for Lucy, from the box of scraps.
- |
  

- I stuff it  with a kind of cobwebby synthetic stuffing I have.
- |
  

- The quilt is  beautiful and suits Lucy.
- |
  

- One side is all rosebuds and the other side  is squares cut from a lake at sunset.
- Now they're all, my dolls, lying like mummies in a cardboard box.
- |
  

- I wrapped each one individually in Kleenex after making them watch me  take all the furniture out of their house.
- |
  

- Then I took the dollhouse  and the box of furniture and people upstairs to the attic.
- |
  

- They're  all sleeping except one.
- |
  

- Eleanor still has her eyes open and you can  hear her breathing.

  I have a dollhouse. My mother got it for me at a yard sale. It's 
  blue and the inside of it is white, except I painted some of the 
  rooms with light watercolors. It's a very big, primitive dollhouse, 
  like a cave. Some of the doorways are broken.
  There are no stairs so I took an old phone receiver with the cord 
  hanging off of it, and I made the receiver into a bed with the cord 
  hanging down as a spiral ladder. My dolls can climb up and down the 
  ladder. Sometimes they get in fights and one doll will push another 
  doll off the ladder two stories down to the ground.
  I think the phone is really comfortable to sleep on because of all 
  the buttons on it.
  I wish that I could shrink and live in my dollhouse. I read books 
  about people shrinking and living in dollhouses. Or people who are 
  already small and live in dollhouses.

  age 11. Marian, 10. Eleanor, 9. Michael, 3. Aster, 2. The Baby, 1. 
  They have to share bedrooms. Times are hard but there is always 
  plastic bread, and some oranges and bananas, and some meat, some

  Lucy is the luckiest and the most incongruous in the family. She
