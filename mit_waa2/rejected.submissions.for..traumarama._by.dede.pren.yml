- I couldn't believe it!
- |
  

- There I was getting ready for lunch when I noticed that my crush was standing right in front of me.
- |
  

- He was so gorgeous; I nearly fainted.
- |
  

- We kibitzed about the game on Friday as he handed me a large piece of pumpkin pie that I devoured instantly.
- |
  

- OOPS!
- |
  

- As soon as we got to the checkout lady I had eaten all my food and his!
- |
  

- YIKES!
- |
  

- Then I dove across him and started chewing on his left hand!
- |
  

- OUCH!
- |
  

- He pushed me to the floor, but it was too late.
- |
  

- I had swallowed his adorable pinkie finger.
- |
  

- Thanks for nothing, Prader-Willi syndrome!
- |
  

- I was SOOOOO embarrassed.
- |
  

- Jessica, 15, North Dallas
- The hottie I had been crushing on walked into the Halloween dance looking SOOOOO amazing.
- |
  

- His Superman costume fit him so well he could have been the real Superman.
- |
  

- I finally decided to listen to the demonic voices in my head and go up and talk to him.
- |
  

- SWEAT SWEAT, STINKY SWEAT!
- |
  

- I was SOOOO nervous when I got up to him all I could do was scream, "Die, impure one, die!
- |
  

- "\" When the security staff finally ripped the Swiss Army knife from my hand, my hottie-boy crush lay lifeless on the linoleum."
- |
  

- GRODY!
- |
  

- I looked around and saw that all the upperclassmen were snickering.
- |
  

- It was the worst ever!
- |
  

- And I totally got entrails on my Marilyn Manson costume.
- |
  

- Bummer.
- |
  

- Phoebe, 17, Salt Lake City
- I've been going to Camp Kokawalla for the past three years, and this past summer was my last chance to see to the cutest counselor that ever wore a whistle!
- |
  

- On the last night, during the season-end Ghoulish Games/Creepy Cabin contest, I was walking through the counselor's haunted quarters hoping I could find counselor Dreamy McHotterson, pretend to get scared, and faint into his arms.
- |
  

- Talk about a Nightmario Scenario!
- |
  

- I turned a corner and the  Scream  guy jumped out and caught me unawares.
- |
  

- I screamed, tripped over a glowing skull, and bumped my head.
- |
  

- Wait.
- |
  

- What am I doing?
- |
  

- What was I talking about?
- |
  

- Oh, yeah, I really like newborn puppies!
- |
  

- Especially the chocolaty ones!
- |
  

- I have one named Licorice.
- |
  

- Jesse, 17, Chippewa Falls
- Volleyball was starting and I had to get my physical.
- |
  

- I was sitting there waiting in my hospital gown when the door opened.
- |
  

- Instead of some crusty old doctor, the most gorgeous guy I've ever seen walked into the room.
- |
  

- He looked more like a TV doctor than a real doctor!
- |
  

- He started to check my vitals, and I felt my stomach start to flutter.
- |
  

- He poked and prodded, and my stomach started turning flips.
- |
  

- Doc Hottie started feeling my tummy.
- |
  

- He pushed on my bellybutton and whammo-bammo!
- |
  

- I bump-set-pooped all over the examining table!
- |
  

- I was so embarrassed I just sprinted out of the room!
- |
  

- Talk about a Spalding tattoo .
- |
  

- Tara, 16, San Diego
