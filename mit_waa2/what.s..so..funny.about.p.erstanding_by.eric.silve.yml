- If we're talking about the kind of love my father's friends feel for their comic books and old sci-fi movies, there's something funny about that love.
- |
  

- It seems like people are most paranoid and violently reactive to adversity during peacetime.
- |
  

- OK, that's not so much funny as it is ironic.
- |
  

- Most Eastern martial arts are founded on the basis of the practitioner's being "at peace" with himself. Martial arts are not generally funny, except in the case of  Hong Kong Phooey . That shit's hilarious.
- |
  

- We all think puppy love is a really innocent and starry-eyed love between couples, but have you ever really watched puppies?
- |
  

- It's more of a hump-anything-until-you're-satisfied kind of love, which in many cases is a more appropriate metaphor than the former.
- |
  

- Nothing's so funny about Love all by itself, but when you put words in front of or behind it, it can make you giggle.
- |
  

- Try it.
- |
  

- Monkey Love.
- |
  

- Love Toilets.
- |
  

- Monkey Love Toilets.
- |
  

- It's great.
- |
  

- Love's extremely funny when used as the basis for a reality show, especially when a woman announces she is saving her virginity for the lucky bachelor.
- |
  

- That time when Mrs. Bunderbridge hired Peace, Love, and Understanding to paint her house, and Peace accidentally painted Understanding's face while he was talking to Love, who was holding the ladder.
- |
  

- Understanding always was the brains of the operation.
