- MOST COMMON RECURRING DREAMS
- OF THE CICADA.
- By  Tracy Moller
- Digging and digging to surface, but never emerging
- Mating with one's own mother
- Being eaten by dog or other yard animal
- Never-ending fall from tree as a nymph
- Stuck in shell midmolt
- Emerge from ground, only to realize that it's not the right year
- Not knowing the song
- Being chased by lawn mower
- Slowly drowning in swimming-pool skimmer basket
- Being captured and placed in mayonnaise jar with handful of torn grass, twig, and cup of water
- Being captured and placed in same jar as above, only without air holes punched in jar lid
- Uncomfortable extended existential conversation with one's own shell
- Late for spawn&#8212;all the hot cicadas are taken
- Mandibles loose and/or falling off

  MOST COMMON RECURRING DREAMS
  OF THE CICADA.
  By  Tracy Moller
  Digging and digging to surface, but never emerging
  Mating with one's own mother
  Being eaten by dog or other yard animal
  Never-ending fall from tree as a nymph
  Stuck in shell midmolt
  Emerge from ground, only to realize that it's not the right year
  Not knowing the song
  Being chased by lawn mower
  Slowly drowning in swimming-pool skimmer basket
  Being captured and placed in mayonnaise jar with handful of torn grass, twig, and cup of water
  Being captured and placed in same jar as above, only without air holes punched in jar lid
  Uncomfortable extended existential conversation with one's own shell
  Late for spawn&#8212;all the hot cicadas are taken
  Mandibles loose and/or falling off
  and, most common:
  That one where you're flying
