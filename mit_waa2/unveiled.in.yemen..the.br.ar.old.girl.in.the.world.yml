- Among the films featured in  Wholphin  No. 3 is one called  A Stranger in Her Own City .
- |
  

- It follows Nejmia, a 13-year-old Yemeni girl who flouts custom by not wearing a veil, by playing in the streets with boys her age, by riding a bicycle, a scooter, and generally by doing whatever she likes.
- |
  

- She is cursed, ridiculed, and threatened, but, buoyed by a truly indomitable spirit, she perseveres with incredible good humor and sense of perspective.
- Director Khadija Al-Salami met Nejmia on the streets of Sanaa, Yemen, in 2005 and filmed her over the course of 72 hours.
- |
  

- Read an interview with the director below and watch an excerpt of the film  here .
- |
  

- "Q: Were you ever worried for Nejmia's safety, or your own, while filming?"
- "KHADIJA AL-SALAMI: This film was shot without any preparation."
- |
  

- One day I was walking around the old city of Sanaa with a group of French journalists I had brought with me to Yemen to promote my country as part of my job at the embassy.
- |
  

- Suddenly, I saw this young girl struggling to live her life freely and naturally in a society full of so many restrictions when it comes to women.
- Fortunately, I had my camera with me and started shooting spontaneously.
- |
  

- The second and third days, I went to find her in her neighborhood and filmed as she struggled to defend herself.
- |
  

- I did not have a problem filming, because I was by myself and discreet and Nejmia's personality put her in the spotlight, because the people are not used to a strong girl like her.
- Though people were against her, I noticed a feeling of admiration as they joked and laughed with her.
- "Q: You, like Nejmia, were born in Sanaa, Yemen, and, in the film, you focus on glaringly apparent gender inequalities and expectations."
- |
  

- It is incredible that, despite oppression, you, and Nejmia, have such a strong sense of self and entitlement.
- |
  

- What inspired that strength?
- |
  

- What, or who, were your influences?
- "KS: I think the strength came from the desire to live free and with dignity and to have our destiny in our own hands, not in the hands of tradition and culture."
- |
  

- All human beings are born free, but unfortunately certain traditions and cultures in some countries impose a lot of restrictions, especially when it comes to women's rights.
- |
  

- It imprisons their dreams and goals in life.
- |
  

- If a woman decides to break through and prove that she is equal to men and has the same abilities as men do, the consequences are heavy.
- |
  

- She can easily lose not only her reputation but the whole family will be badly criticized.
- "Q: After escaping an unhappy arranged marriage at the age of 11, you realized the importance of education as a gateway to freedom."
- |
  

- How did you ensure yourself an education?
- |
  

- And what do you think would have become of you had you not?
- "KS: The road to my rebellious personality was not easy in a very traditional country like Yemen, where I was considered a woman at 11 years old and my family forced me to marry."
- |
  

- At that moment, I realized that I was alone and decided to win this battle at any cost.
- When I saw there was no other choice, I decided to commit suicide.
- |
  

- Fortunately, it did not work out and at that moment my mother stood by me and helped me to get divorced.
- |
  

- The marriage only lasted three weeks, during summer vacation, but I knew from an early age that education is the key to success and to independence.
- |
  

- I did all I could to pursue my education and also to work at the same time.
- |
  

- Those who opposed me very strongly when I was very young, especially family relatives, nowadays praise me and say they hope their daughters will follow in my footsteps.
- |
  

- Instead of being the bad example, I became a good example.
- |
  

- This change makes me happy, like I at least contributed toward helping the evolution of women in my country.
- |
  

- Now we see women participating in political life and working in different fields.
- |
  

- They have proven they are capable of making a great change in the society.
- |
  

- If I did not do what I did, I would now be a grandmother with at least six children.
- |
  

- Some women are happy with this life, but I would not be.
- |
  

- Every woman should be able to choose.
- |
  

- For me, I would be living miserably, not having the chance to travel and meet interesting people and learn so many things and appreciate life and what it has to offer.
- "Q: I was surprised the town's mosque leader (was he a grand imam?"
- |
  

- Nejmia.
- |
  

- Why was that?
- "KS: The mosque imam was so supportive of Nejmia because he does not interpret Islamic teachings to mean that women are inferior to men."
- |
  

- He does not use religion as an excuse to deprive women of their rights, or use religion to justify their ideas when it is really local customs and traditions.
- |
  

- SPOILER WARNING.
- |
  

- "Q: Finally\x97a year later\x97how and where is Nejmia?"
- |
  

- Do you keep in touch with her?
- |
  

- What is she like now?
- |
  

- What has been the effect of this documentary on Nejmia?
- |
  

- On the town?
- "KS: Seven months after shooting the film, Nejmia's father stopped her from going to school and ordered her to wear the veil."
- |
  

- A year later, this film won first prize at the Beirut Film Festival.
- |
  

- The president of Yemen was visiting France at that time and heard about the prize.
- |
  

- He asked me to show him the film.
- |
  

- I thought he would not like it, because it shows society looking down on women, but I was wrong.
- |
  

- He was drawn by Nejmia's personality and, at the end of the film, he asked me to tell Nejmia's family that he would like to pay for her education.
- |
  

- I was very happy to hear that and thought that was the best prize I could ever get for the film.
- |
  

- Now Nejmia is back at school.
- |
  

- I think it is the most important element for a better and independent future.
- |
  

- The more a woman is educated, the more she knows her rights and is able to defend them, and the more useful she will be to her family and to society as a whole.
- The film was not screened on Yemeni TV, because they are not used to such controversial subject matter.
