- It was February, and five children, all of whom were more or less healthy, were sitting on the ground in a lazy circle.
- |
  

- It was quite dark, and the children had to squint to see one another's frowning faces.
- "\"I wish we were ice skating,\""
- |
  

- Robin.
- "\"I wish we were eating Mexican food,\""
- |
  

- Apu.
- "\"I wish we were wearing boots,\""
- |
  

- Alistair.
- "\"I wish we were playing percussion instruments,\""
- |
  

- Lillian.
- Miranda sighed.
- |
  

- She was the youngest of the five children, but nevertheless she was often the leader of the group.
- |
  

- She tried not to be bossy about it, but it is difficult not to be bossy from time to time.
- |
  

- "\"We can't do any of those things,\""
- |
  

- "\"We're not at a skating rink, and we don't have any skates."
- |
  

- We're not in Mexico, and there's not an enchilada in sight.
- |
  

- We're not wearing boots, and there's not a department store for miles around.
- |
  

- And we're not playing percussion instruments, because it wouldn't be wise to make so much noise.
- |
  

- After all, we're in a puzzling and possibly dangerous situation.
- |
  

- I know it's difficult to believe, but we may have to face the fact that we're on our own.
- "\"But how can that be?"
- "\" Robin asked."
- |
  

- "\"Just a few hours ago we were on a picnic with Madame Blatavsky, when all of a sudden the mysterious man just came and asked about us and our lives were SHATTERED."
- "\"He just shot Madame Blatavsky and took our quesadillas,\""
- |
  

- Apu.
- "\"And my harmonica,\""
- |
  

- Lillian.
- "\"And my skates,\""
- |
  

- Robin.
- "\"And my boots,\""
- |
  

- Alistair.
- "\"It is unbelievable,\""
- |
  

- Miranda.
- |
  

- "\"But it's true."
- "\"We are in so much danger."
- |
  

- That MAN with that 38-caliber pistol knows us.
- |
  

- He is such a dirty scoundrel,"
- |
  

- Lillian.
- |
  

- "\"I can't believe he stole my harmonica."
- "\"I can believe he stole my\x97\""
- |
  

- Apu was interrupted by a sharp comment from Miranda.
- "\"Stop it!"
- "\" she said very snappily."
- |
  

- "\"Do I have to explain to a 14-, 11-, 10-, and 9-year-old about how to keep focus?"
- |
  

- "\"Sorry, Boss,\""
- |
  

- Apu muttered.
- "\"What did you say!"
- "\" Miranda started rising up."
- |
  

- While the kids arose from their positions and starting fighting once again something was lurking in the fog.
- Something very dark and mysterious.
