- One evening, after supper, while doing dishes in the kitchen, Zachary noticed his mother floating.
- |
  

- His mother was washing, he was drying.
- |
  

- He had dropped a fork and bent down to get it when he saw that his mother was about an inch off the floor.
- |
  

- He looked up.
- |
  

- Her face seemed fine.
- |
  

- Same as ever.
- |
  

- She was singing along with the radio.
- |
  

- "She didn't know the words so she was singing: \"Mmhmm, love, mmhmm, mmhmm."
- Zachary figured what he saw was a trick of the light.
- |
  

- He lay down on his belly on the black and white tiles of the checkerboard linoleum for a closer look.
- |
  

- No, her bare feet were definitely not touching the floor.
- |
  

- He flattened his hand and passed it underneath her.
- |
  

- The tiny hairs on the tops of his knuckles must have tickled her soles, for she looked down at him and smiled.
- |
  

- "\"What are you doing down there?"
- "\" she asked."
- Zachary stood up fast, waving the fork.
- |
  

- "\"Getting this,\""
- |
  

- "\"Well, give it to me,\""
- |
  

- "\"I'll wash it again."
- And he did.
- But the next morning, when Zachary went downstairs, his mother was floating higher off the kitchen floor than she'd been the night before.
- |
  

- A couple of feet higher.
- |
  

- And that afternoon when she met him at school, she was floating that much higher off the sidewalk again than when she'd seen him off that morning.
- |
  

- The other kids' mothers didn't come to get them at school any more, so Zachary usually walked ahead of his mother until they both turned the corner.
- |
  

- Then he'd let her take his hand.
- Today, though, although he stretched way up and she bent way down &#151; in fact for one dizzy spinning moment, she somersaulted upside down and then back to right-side up &#151; they couldn't reach.
- |
  

- They couldn't get their hands to touch.
- |
  

- When that happened, his mother opened her purse and threw her wallet down to Zachary.
- |
  

- Zachary took it and ran into the corner store where he bought a roll of white string.
- |
  

- Back outside, he bit the plastic covering off, spit it into the street, and scrabbled for the end of the string.
- |
  

- He grabbed a piece of flinty blue rock out of the gutter and tied the string around it, using a slipknot he'd learned at Boy Scouts.
- |
  

- Then he threw the rock up to his mother.
- |
  

- She caught it, undid it, and put the piece of rock in her purse.
- |
  

- And then, using only her right hand, she tied the string around her left wrist.
- |
  

- It took her some time.
- |
  

- She blew him a kiss when she was finished.
- "\"Is it double-knotted?"
- "\" Zachary called."
- "\"It's double-knotted!"
- "\" said Zachary's mother."
- |
  

- She laughed and pointed at his undone sneakers.
- |
  

- Sheepish, Zachary grinned.
- |
  

- He turtle-hunched on the uneven sidewalk &#151; bum set firmly on the roll of string, tongue between teeth &#151; and retied his laces.
- |
  

- A lone blade of grass was growing out of a crack in the cement.
- They headed home, his mother trailing Zachary like a balloon.
- |
  

- By the time they got there, she was more like a kite.
- |
  

- Too high up to get in the house.
- |
  

- Zachary tugged on the string for a while, trying to pull her down out of the sky, but each time he tugged, she seemed to float up that much higher.
- |
  

- So he stopped.
- Zachary made dinner while his mother hovered outside.
- |
  

- He liked being the one in charge for a change.
- |
  

- He prepared foods that were good to throw.
- |
  

- Boiled eggs and bagels.
- |
  

- He took them outside and threw his mother an egg.
- |
  

- She peeled it and sprinkled the eggshell on him, for a joke.
- |
  

- After that, he tossed a bagel way up beside her; she caught it on her index finger and spun it around a couple of times before eating it.
- |
  

- For the finale, Zachary threw her a container of chocolate milk.
- "\"Good one!"
- "\" called his mother approvingly."
- |
  

- "\"This serves as both a beverage and a delicious dessert!"
- When he went in for the night, he had to leave the kitchen door open a crack for the string.
- |
  

- He had to unwind it some more as he made his way up the stairs.
- |
  

- Inside his bedroom, he stuck the roll of string on one of his bedposts.
- |
  

- He thought he'd skip his bath, since his mother couldn't see what he was doing inside the house.
- |
  

- But when he stuck his head outside the window to say good night, she called down to him.
- |
  

- "\"I can still see eggshells in your hair!"
- "\" she said."
- |
  

- "\"Have you washed?"
- Zachary had to admit he hadn't.
- |
  

- He took the roll of string with him into the bathroom, unwinding it even more.
- |
  

- He couldn't risk leaving it.
- He went back to the window with wet hair.
- "\"Good, now get in bed,\""
- |
  

- "\"And I'll sing you to sleep."
- "\" She sang the song from the radio, the one without words."
- |
  

- "\"Mmhmm, love, mmhmm, mmhmm,\""
- |
  

- Zachary hummed along until he fell asleep.
- |
  

- Every so often during the night he heard the roll spin around the bedpost as his mother drifted further into the sky.
- |
  

- The next morning he couldn't throw the food high enough.
- |
  

- He stood in the backyard, trying to throw an apple up to her but it kept plummeting back to earth.
- |
  

- The air smelled of bruised apple; his tears tasted like salt.
- |
  

- Zachary threw the apple into the air again and again until, finally, it hit the chimney and exploded.
- |
  

- At that, he collapsed onto the lawn and pushed his face into the dirt.
- "\"Don't worry, baby!"
- "\" his mother called."
- |
  

- Faint and faraway.
- |
  

- "\"The birds will feed me now."
- |
  

- They'll feed me seeds and.
- |
  

- Something else; he couldn't hear.
- |
  

- Worms?
- A robin lifted off the roof with a piece of apple in its beak.
- |
  

- Soaring toward his mother.
- |
  

- He could hardly see her now.
- |
  

- A shadow against the sun.
- |
  

- He looked down at his hands; the roll of string was almost completely unwound.
- |
  

- Zachary shot into the house, desperate for something to anchor her.
- The heavy armchair in the living room.
- |
  

- There was just enough string to go around the fattest part.
- |
  

- He went outside and yelled up to his mother to tell her; if she answered, he couldn't hear it.
- |
  

- As he stepped back inside, the chair moved to meet him.
- |
  

- It slid out of the living room, across the kitchen floor, and slammed against the back door.
- |
  

- The frame buckled.
- His mother's scarf was hanging on a hook.
- |
  

- Zachary grabbed it and tied it around one of the armchair's stubby legs.
- Zachary's hands gripped the end of the scarf so tightly that his fingernails bit into his palms.
- |
  

- When the door gave way, Zachary was already running.
- |
  

- The armchair hovered a foot or so off the ground as he headed for the highest point in town, a hill three streets over.
- Zachary ran up the crooked sidewalk.
- |
  

- At first the armchair hovered low beside him, then it pulled ahead of him and rose higher.
- |
  

- The scarf began to stretch tight.
- |
  

- By the time Zachary got to the top of the hill his arms reached straight up over his head.
- |
  

- He panted for air; he couldn't bend over.
- |
  

- He stood straighter than he'd ever stood before.
- |
  

- He stretched higher, until he was standing on the tips of his toes.
- |
  

- Then Zachary was suspended an inch off the ground, and he looked up for his mother.
- He couldn't really see her.
- |
  

- All she was, if that was her, was a smudge in the sky.
- |
  

- Still, he thought he could hear her calling to him.
- |
  

- "He thought he could hear her saying: \"Let go, Zachary!"
- |
  

- Let go!
- He wasn't sure.
- |
  

- It would be a lie to say he knew, absolutely, that's what she said.
- He let go.
- The armchair flew up.
- |
  

- The scarf snapped in the wind.
- |
  

- The tail end of it fluttered.
- He watched it all go.
- |
  

- The speck that was his mother, the string, the armchair, and the scarf.
- Was there a place in the sky where his mother would stop?
- He walked to the library and checked out some books.
- |
  

- Books about science.
- |
  

- He lay down on the lawn and opened the first book.
- |
  

- It said there was a blanket of air around the earth that kept everything tucked in.
- |
  

- If that were true, then his mother wouldn't be able to break through that blanket.
- |
  

- She could rest up there, with her back pressed against it.
- |
  

- Like lying down to go to sleep, only in reverse.
- |
  

- He liked to think of her that way.
- But the books were wrong about the thing they called gravity.
- |
  

- So maybe they were wrong about other things, too.
- |
  

- And maybe his mother would float up to the moon.
- |
  

- Or maybe his mother would float past it.
- |
  

- What would she see out there?
- |
  

- Could the birds fly that far to feed her?
