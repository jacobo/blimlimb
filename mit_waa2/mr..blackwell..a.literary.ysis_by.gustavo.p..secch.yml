- "Cameron Diaz:  \"On 'Any Given Sunday'/ Cameron falls prey to a  freaky fashion curse/ And as the week continues,/ she just slips  from bad to worse."

- So we get "curse" rhymed with "worse," all ruled by the "slippage" of Cameron's taste throughout the stanza.

  LOS ANGELES (AP) &#151; Mr. Blackwell's annual list of fashion frumps
   includes Cher, Celine Dion, Queen Elizabeth and Martha Stewart,
   who he dressed down as  "dull, dowdy and devastatingly dreary."
  Here we see a clear example of assonant, first-letter alliteration, one
  of
  Blackwell's preferred stylistic devices. The quadruple use of the device
  is
  somehow excessive, but so are the subjects of the line. Overall, it's a
  good thing.
  Blackwell, a former fashion designer who writes a column for a
   supermarket tabloid and entertains on ocean cruises, did have
   something nice to say. He declared that Gwyneth Paltrow, Sophia
   Loren, Oprah Winfrey, Camryn Manhein, Barbra Streisand, Halle
   Berry, Helen Mirren, Nicole Kidman, Sharon Stone and Princess
   Caroline of Monaco were  "fabulous fashion independents."
  Again the alliteration, this time consonant and restrained, also in
  consonance with the fabulous style of the women in question. This man is
  a
  genius. A genius who entertains on ocean cruises.
  Mr. Blackwell's 40th annual worst-dressed women list and his
   comments:
  1. Cher:  "A million beads/ And one overexposed
   derriere."
  Free verse. The clashing use of the French prevents the accidental
  alliteration that could have been easily attained (compare with
  "buttocks"
  or "bum") and brings out the francophone roots of "million" for a double
  
  punch of excessive gaudiness.
  2. Celine Dion:  "In her backward tuxedo/ There's no way of
   knowing/ Whether Diva Dion is coming or going./ A profusion of
   confusion."
  Consonant alliteration AND double consonant rhyme (end-rhyme AND
  internal).
  A masterpiece of confused style, repeating the motif of the final line.
  3. Queen Elizabeth:  "Was she the palace Christmas tree/ Or just a
   royal clown? "
  Almost a haiku, unbalanced by that least royal of stylistic devices, the
  
  pun. Also subversively violates Oscar Wilde's assertion that "the Queen
  is
  not a subject."
  4. Martha Stewart:  "Dresses like the centerfold for the Farmer's
   Almanac."
  Simple. Subdued. Deceptively so. Just like Martha.
  5. Fiona Apple:  "A kinked and curled Kewpie Doll/ wrapped in a
   collection/ Of yesterday's fatal fashion frights."
  The messy, bratty alliteration of the first line ebbs down to the
  plainness
  of the middle verse only to lead to the triple punch of the finale.
  Blackwell's  uneven movements mimic those star-stop rhythms favored by
  the
  anorexic singer.
  6. Britney Spears:  "This belly-baring songbird/ is better heard
   than seen."
  Alliteration across the lines, leading to a pun that both emphasizes the
  
  child-porn quality of Spears' oeuvre AND her alleged relationship with
  Prince Andrew (see above comment of pun as anti-royal subversion).
  Notice
  the use of British slang "bird" ("young woman") giving away the royal
  connection confirmed by Blackwell's use of the pun.
  7. Sarah Jessica Parker:  "From 'Sex and the City'/ Sarah's
   fashions are a mix-and-match pity."
  A simple, homely consonant rhyme with just a tinge of alliteration.
  Mixing
  and matching devices, like Sarah's clothing. All descending from "sex"
  to
  "pity."
  8. Jennifer Aniston:  "She's a fashion bore and a snore."
  One line (with internal consonant rhyme) is all it takes for Blackwell
  to
  dethrone yesteryear's "it girl." If Blackwell is bored, so are we.
  9. Cameron Diaz:  "On 'Any Given Sunday'/ Cameron falls prey to a
   freaky fashion curse/ And as the week continues,/ she just slips
   from bad to worse."
  The rhyme pattern ABCB with longer rhymed verses is a characteristic
  balladic form, one that Blackwell rarely employs unless he means to
  comment
  ironically on the perception of fashion as a magical concept. So we get
  "curse" rhymed with "worse," all ruled by the "slippage" of Cameron's
  taste
  throughout the stanza. Perhaps also one could find an allusion to her
  fall
  (i.e., "slip") from style since the days of "The Mask, " where she wore
  a
  notorious "slip" dress.
  10. The Dixie Chicks:  "They look like a trio of truckstop
   fashion tragedies/ trapped in a typhoon."
  The list's finale is a bravura tour de force, with Blackwell not pulling
  
  any stops in his characterization of the country trio. There's quadruple
  
  two-letter alliteration, offset by a final one-letter alliteration that
  illustrate the maelstrom produced by bad fashion sense on the aesthete's
  
  mind. A typhoon indeed.
