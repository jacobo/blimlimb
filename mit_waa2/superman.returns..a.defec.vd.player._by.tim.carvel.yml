- Hi.
- |
  

- Excuse me.
- |
  

- "I'd like to return th\x97"
- |
  

- Oh.
- |
  

- Sorry.
- |
  

- I didn't realize.
- |
  

- Ha ha!
- |
  

- Yes, good point, you really would think I'd notice a line like that, what with the X-ray vision and all.
- |
  

- That's a good one!
- |
  

- So, uh, I hope you don't mind me asking, but how long would you say the wait is?
- |
  

- Ouch!
- |
  

- Listen, is there any way I could maybe take a number, go away, and come back?
- |
  

- It's just that I've got a lot of stuff on my plate today.
- |
  

- There's a cat stuck in a tree three blocks from here .
- |
  

- Toronto .
- |
  

- Nigeria .
- |
  

- "I don't mean to sound like a jerk or anything\x97really."
- |
  

- I'm just kind of slammed today.
- |
  

- No, no, I understand.
- |
  

- Rules are rules.
- |
  

- I'll just go wait over there.
- |
  

- While the orphans burn.
- |
  

- One hour and 45 minutes later.
- |
  

- Hey, hi.
- |
  

- Me again.
- |
  

- You may not remember, but we met around two hours ago.
- |
  

- I was the superhero you told to wait?
- |
  

- "So listen: I got this DVD player, and it turns out that the frame-advance feature doesn't work."
- |
  

- No, my powers don't include the ability to slow down a DVD.
- |
  

- Why would that even be a superpower?
- |
  

- It's not like, thanks to your planet's yellow sun, I suddenly have dominion over home appliances.
- |
  

- Does it really matter why I want to use the frame-advance feature?
- |
  

- I don't think it would be any business of yours if I  were , as you say, "sitting around the Fortress of Solitude frame-advancing through Halle Berry's nude scenes.
- "\" Which I'm not."
- |
  

- Look, sometimes I just like to use it to pick up details I missed, OK?
- |
  

- Just drop it.
- |
  

- What do I have to do to get my money back?
- |
  

- "Well, no, it was a gift, y'see, so I don't\x97"
- |
  

- Really?
- |
  

- A "gift receipt"? I've never heard of such a thing.
- |
  

- Yeah, well, maybe when they came into vogue I was busy, I dunno,  saving Metropolis from General Zod .
- |
  

- No, I don't want a medal, and I'm quite pleased with my chest.
- |
  

- Also, I don't appreciate your tone.
- |
  

- There's really no need to repeat what I just said back to me in a high-pitched girlie voice.
- |
  

- Hey, c'mon, cut it out!
- |
  

- Thank you.
- |
  

- "Now: Can I return this, or not?"
- |
  

- "So let me get this straight: You sold a defective product, and now, because I don't have a tiny slip of paper, I'm stuck with it?"
- |
  

- I have a friend at the  Daily Planet  who might be  very  interested in this story.
- |
  

- No, my friend at the  Planet  doesn't need to get out more.
- |
  

- "He's actually quite charming and\x97"
- |
  

- What do you mean you're going on break?
- |
  

- We're in the middle of a conversation!
- |
  

- No! Wait!
- |
  

- Don't you dare pull that barrier down!
- |
  

- Well, that's odd.
- |
  

- "I\x97I can't see through the barrier."
- |
  

- "My X-ray vision\x97it's failing me."
- |
  

- It seems my superpowers are no match for your awesome and complete indifference.
- |
  

- I'm feeling weak.
- |
  

- Must leave .
- |
  

- Cable guy coming .
- |
  

- Can't  miss appointment .
- |
  

- Impossible .
