- "Blondie, wife : I do love you."
- |
  

- I can't help that.
- |
  

- But your relationship with food is killing you.
- |
  

- It's killing us.
- |
  

- At first it seemed like an eccentricity.
- |
  

- Charming, almost.
- |
  

- Almost.
- |
  

- But the sandwiches, those obscene, grotesque sandwiches you consume .
- |
  

- Why do you need them so desperately?
- |
  

- Why do you eat them so late at night?
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- What are those goddamn sandwiches giving you that your family can't seem to?
- |
  

- "I'm sorry to scream\x97there's just\x97a lot of things are releasing right now."
- "Herb Woodley, neighbor : Listen, Dag, everyone here has a theory on what's wrong with you."
- |
  

- Hell, we don't all agree on what THE thing is; we just know it's something.
- |
  

- Like for me, it seems like kleptomania.
- |
  

- How many of my tools do you actually have by this point?
- |
  

- Our garages are next to each other; I know my tools are in there.
- |
  

- I spend at least a hundred bucks a month at Home Depot buying new tools because you simply never give mine back.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Why do you never give me back my tools?
- |
  

- What are you trying to prove?
- "Blondie, wife : The only thing I hate\x97HATE\x97more than the eating is the sleeping."
- |
  

- I've been reading some things online and I think you have undiagnosed clinical depression.
- |
  

- Listen, just because you're asleep, it doesn't mean that life stops.
- |
  

- You can take your naps on the couch, you can sleep in a hammock, you can oversleep before rushing off to work.
- |
  

- "But I have news for you, Dagwood: the world is still here."
- |
  

- And you have to face it just like everyone else.
- |
  

- So maybe you should just wake the fuck up, Dagwood Bumstead.
- "Mr. Beasley, mail carrier : You're violent."
- |
  

- Bumping into me all the time.
- |
  

- I just want to deliver the stupid mail.
- |
  

- You're a violent, violent man.
- |
  

- Is it some sort of primal thing, Mr. B? Do you think I'm trying to invade your home?
- |
  

- What are you, a dog?
- |
  

- Some kind of beast?
- |
  

- I've had three concussions in the last two years thanks to you.
- |
  

- I keep losing my keys and my shoes now.
- |
  

- I never did that before.
- |
  

- The other day I had an emotional breakdown at the 7-Eleven.
- |
  

- Common for someone with head trauma, they tell me.
- |
  

- Why do you hate me, .
- |
  

- Dog .
- |
  

- You need to go to a hospital!
- "Blondie, wife : I'm selling the catering business, just so you know."
- |
  

- I mean, how screwed up was that?
- |
  

- Talk about enabling.
- |
  

- You have a problem with food?
- |
  

- Here, let me bring you more of it.
- |
  

- And let me sabotage my own business by having you eat the inventory.
- |
  

- How about a little gasoline for that fire?
- |
  

- The cycle ends today.
- |
  

- "Don't\x97NO!"
- |
  

- Dagwood.
- |
  

- They're for the goddamn food bank.
- |
  

- Christ.
- "Julius Dithers, employer : There's a right way to run a business and a wrong way."
- |
  

- I've been running mine the wrong way.
- |
  

- For years.
- |
  

- Decades, really.
- |
  

- I know that now.
- |
  

- You come into work, you fall asleep, I yell at you, you wake up, I fire you.
- |
  

- Now that part is OK; that's what anyone would do.
- |
  

- But then I always let you stick around somehow.
- |
  

- My therapist says its simple codependence.
- |
  

- I need you to screw up so I can fire you and feel powerful.
- |
  

- Then I always hire you back so I can feel heroic.
- |
  

- I'm not doing you any favors.
- |
  

- This cycle has got to stop.
- "Alexander Bumstead, son : That's right, Dad."
- |
  

- It's a shaved head.
- |
  

- Look at it!
- |
  

- Look at me!
- |
  

- I've been trying to look exactly like you my whole life.
- |
  

- The little tufts of hair sprouting out the sides.
- |
  

- I thought maybe if I looked like you, you would accept me and I would get to be in the strip a little more often.
- |
  

- But it didn't work and then I was just a teenage freak who looked like Dagwood Bumstead.
- |
  

- What kind of character is that?
- |
  

- Well, no more.
- |
  

- I'm joining the Army.
- |
  

- I ship out for Camp Swampy tomorrow.
- "Cookie Bumstead, daughter : You named me after food."
- |
  

- I don't think I need to say anything else.
- "Blondie, wife : I was a flapper."
- |
  

- Did you all know that?
- |
  

- I barely remember it myself anymore but I still have some of the old strips.
- |
  

- Way back in the '20s.
- |
  

- Ah, the jazz, the parties, the bathtub gin.
- |
  

- Those were some times.
- |
  

- I was in love with life.
- |
  

- And now look at me, struggling to keep a family together while propping up a manic-depressive husband with an eating disorder.
- |
  

- Does anyone want to see my album of old strips?
- "Julius Dithers, employer : You're fired, also."
- |
  

- Forgot to mention that.
- |
  

- I mean it this time.
- "Elmo, paperboy : My parents say I need to stop being friends with you."
- |
  

- They say you haven't done anything wrong but that I'm just the paperboy.
- |
  

- I shouldn't be hanging out at your house or talking to you all the time.
- |
  

- That's not part of my job.
- |
  

- They said you're not my friend.
- "Alexander Bumstead, son : See, that's another thing."
- |
  

- You're always talking to the paperboy, listening to him, having this kind of special bond.
- |
  

- I'm your son but I get none of that!
- |
  

- Is it because he's a kid and you want to deal with someone simpler?
- |
  

- Well, I'm not simple, Dad!
- |
  

- Not!
- |
  

- Simple!
- |
  

- "Blondie, wife : We're all tired, Dagwood."
- |
  

- Tired of who you are and what you do to us.
- |
  

- We love you but you need to change.
- |
  

- Because this has been going on for decades.
- |
  

- And we don't want it to stay this way for decades or centuries to come.
- "Julius Dithers, employer : And you better be in the office Monday morning or there's gonna be heck to pay!"
