- A DISPATCH BY  DANIEL LAZAR
- |
  

- JERUSALEM, ISRAEL&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I am spending this year studying in Israel, and so I heard about the attacks late in the afternoon, Israel time.
- |
  

- My uncle Shabtai, who lives on a kibbutz north of Jerusalem, called me around five o'clock.
- |
  

- I closed my Gemara and went outside.
- |
  

- I wasn't concentrating much on the book anyway, as there were some pretty strange rumors flying around school.
- "\"Daniel, did you hear?"
- "\"Yeah, I heard about something in America."
- |
  

- Planes crashing?
- I heard the sounds of the television in the background.
- |
  

- "\"Yes,\""
- |
  

- "\"I watch CNN now."
- |
  

- It is terrible, Daniel, a balagan b'America.
- "\" A mess in America."
- "\"What happened?"
- Another guy came outside, standing beside me on the sidewalk.
- |
  

- He answered his cell phone.
- |
  

- My uncle described what he was watching on TV, Israel's CNN now blaring over the phone.
- |
  

- I looked at the boy next me on the phone.
- |
  

- He stared, bending over, eyebrows rising, and mouth open.
- |
  

- I felt myself doing the same as Shabtai continued talking, verification of the rumors I had heard for the past hour.
- |
  

- They were true.
- "\"What?"
- |
  

- Are you sure?
- "\" I asked."
- "\"Yes."
- |
  

- It is here,"
- |
  

- Shabtai said.
- |
  

- "\"I see on the TV, Daniel."
- |
  

- Like a movie.
- "\"It's too ridiculous to be a movie,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"Who would believe it?"
- Other guys poured out of the building, everyone talking on phones or yelling in groups.
- |
  

- I walked over to a large group.
- |
  

- My phone rang again.
- |
  

- It was my cousin, Sivan.
- |
  

- I told her, yes, I had heard, that Shabtai just called me.
- |
  

- She told not to worry.
- |
  

- Sivan's English is good, but her accent is pronounced, almost exotic, though it is the same accent I heard from my father all my life.
- |
  

- "\"Can you call to America?"
- "\" she asked."
- "\"No, I didn't try."
- "\"Well don't."
- |
  

- It's impossible to get through.
- |
  

- We will try later.
- "\"Okay, thanks."
- Sivan said, "Do not worry.
- "\"I'm not, but how could this happen?"
- |
  

- To America?
- |
  

- It's not Israel, Sivan, it's the United States.
- |
  

- The United States of America.
- |
  

- It's like a miracle, but totally wrong.
- "\"I understand."
- |
  

- Now you will know how it feels to be the victim, yes?
- One of the rabbis came out, calling us inside to recite Tehillim, an impromptu, spontaneous prayer for the moment.
- |
  

- Later I found out almost all the schools did the same.
- |
  

- No one could concentrate on the studies afterwards, and dinner was a blur.
- |
  

- No one even complained about the food - a miracle in and of itself.
- I had planned to meet a friend and go out for dinner that night, but I stayed put in school, in Neve Yaackov, the neighborhood where my yeshiva is located.
- |
  

- Neve Yaackov is supposed to be the secure part of Jerusalem, a haven from the dangers of going into town and a relatively safe place to live.
- My friend was furious with me.
- |
  

- "\"What,\""
- |
  

- "\"does an attack in America have anything to do with us going out now, here in Israel?"
- "\" I told him he was an idiot and that I was going nowhere."
- |
  

- Of course it would have something to do with Israel, directly or not.
- That night, around eleven o'clock, after speaking with other friends in other schools around Jerusalem, after trying to call to America again and again, I was in my room when I heard gunshots outside.
- |
  

- There is an Arab village on the hill over Neve Yaackov, a village within pistol range that was supposed to have been evacuated long ago.
- |
  

- Hearing gunshots, everyone in the dormitory ignored any sense of safety or discretion and ran outside.
- |
  

- We saw the first of the mishtara speed by, their sirens blaring and lights flashing against the white stone buildings.
- |
  

- Even the police in America rarely respond so quickly.
- |
  

- Then the vans and army trucks followed down the block.
- |
  

- My dormitory is on 9 Rechov Zevin.
- |
  

- The bullets hit 20 and 29 Rechov Zevin.
- |
  

- The owner of the pizza shop across the street found a bullet embedded in his wall.
- |
  

- It looked like a large copper tooth.
- Moments later we saw army flares floating over the buildings, lighting up the desert.
- "\"They're looking for someone."
- "\"Who?"
- "\"The shooter, maybe, I guess."
- The lights in the Arab village blinked off&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Israel's standard reaction against even a small insurrection.
- I called my other cousins, who live down the block.
- |
  

- The babysitter answered.
- |
  

- She said, the parents were away.
- |
  

- She was hiding under the table with the kids.
- |
  

- "\"My mother told me it was the guys from your school."
- |
  

- Just the Beis guys making noise,"
- |
  

- "\"No, it wasn't."
- |
  

- Sorry.
- "\"I didn't think so."
- As I stood outside, watching the flares traveling down the hill that is Neve Yaackov, Sivan called me again.
- |
  

- "\"You won't believe what just happened,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- She sucked in breath as I described what I was watching.
- "\"Go inside,\""
- |
  

- "\"Okay,\""
- |
  

- I said, not moving.
- Sivan talked about watching the towers collapse on TV.
- |
  

- There was nothing new that she told me.
- For days after the attacks, whenever I met new people&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;total strangers, Israelis, Palestinians&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;they spoke to me softly, comforting me, as if the World Trade Center and the Pentagon had been my home and the people trapped inside my immediate family.
- |
  

- On Friday, I bought a copy of Time; Newsweek had sold out hours earlier.
- |
  

- As I rode the bus that day through town, I listened to President Bush's statements.
- |
  

- I was glad to hear English on Israeli radio, especially under the circumstances.
- |
