- Troubled Girl.
- Whenever I went to that park to shoot baskets I noticed a girl sitting on the porch of a house across the street.
- |
  

- I thought she was really cute, but couldn't tell how old she was.
- |
  

- "\"Karate Kid\""
- |
  

- I'd seen it six times in the theater.
- |
  

- She looked a little like Elisabeth Shue &#151; I liked the scene in that movie where she had on the tight sweater, and they went to the amusement park.
- She started to come over to the courtside benches when I'd show up.
- |
  

- I was nervous as I talked to her.
- |
  

- She told me she lived with her cousins because her parents were murdered in Chicago.
- |
  

- Nothing ever happened with this relationship, not even a kiss.
- |
  

- She gave me Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA" for Christmas. I never listened to it. We drifted apart that winter, partly because it was too cold to play basketball.
- Five years later I lived in a different town and was in my twenties.
- |
  

- I'd visit my parents for holidays, and one time she called.
- |
  

- I met her in a grocery store parking lot and we sat in my car.
- |
  

- The steering wheel of my car seemed enormous, almost as if it was growing in front of me, as she confessed that she had told me lies about her family.
- |
  

- She said she was married but had always loved me.
- |
  

- I almost wanted to kiss her but was nervous again.
- |
  

- She said her husband beat her up sometimes and that she had a baby boy.
- |
  

- His name was Kevin.
- |
  

- I thought about how long she would have to live with that.
- |
  

- Secret Notebook.
- When I started to accumulate too many dirty magazines to possibly hide in my ceiling, I had to devise a new plan.
- |
  

- I started to cut out the pictures in the magazines.
- |
  

- Only the ones that turned me on a great deal.
- |
  

- I was fifteen-years-old and this took a great deal of time, probably a weekend or more.
- |
  

- When it came to Playboy and Penthouse they were mostly articles, and so it was a little easier.
- |
  

- When I was done, I had a full garbage bag of disregarded magazine pages, and I tossed them in a dumpster three blocks away.
- |
  

- I put the salvaged clippings in a new Pee-Chee and put it back in my ceiling.
- |
  

- It would be easier now to look at these pictures, because I wouldn't have to spread several magazines across my bedspread anymore.
- |
  

- Still I collected more magazines whenever the opportunity arose to steal them from the neighborhood grocery.
- |
  

- I had to start another Pee-Chee and grew tired of most of the old photos.
- |
  

- Like drugs, I started to need harder, stronger, more dangerous forms of pornography.
- |
  

- A few years later, Ted Bundy mentioned having this problem as well.
- |
  

- Many people thought he was trying to blame pornography for his sick crimes, but I couldn't help but wonder if I was not a good person myself.
- I relegated the first Pee-Chee to the basement.
- |
  

- I put it in an old light-blue suitcase with little snap buttons.
- |
  

- When my father found the secret stash a few months later I claimed not to know whose they were.
- |
  

- The Stilts.
- My first apartment was at The Stilts, the cheapest housing in the Tri-Cities, in uptown Richland.
- |
  

- I lived there for two short months.
- |
  

- The first month I was living with three other guys who had decided to move out right as I was moving in.
- |
  

- I was the only one there for the second month.
- |
  

- The one thing I remember about The Stilts was that it used to be an Army barracks or something.
- |
  

- There were six rooms in each apartment, with a small kitchen and bathroom.
- |
  

- A lot of kids just out of high school lived there and there were always parties.
- Despite only being there for roughly sixty days I remember a few memorable nights.
- |
  

- It was a period of time for me where I tried to exact revenge on the ghost of the girl who took my virginity, whom I was convinced had scarred me for life when she dumped me for an ex-boyfriend.
- |
  

- What she did was instill in me a precedent that I would constantly rehash.
- |
  

- I was guilty of using bodies as I recorded sound-bites in my brain &#151; little quotes about how much of a nice guy I was, how cute I was &#151; I played them back in my head to somehow validate my actions and make myself feel good, like blurbs on a book jacket.
- |
  

- I was taking advantage of anyone whom I thought was as weak as me.
- After that I lived in a trailer park before moving to Spokane, where I lived next to a staple factory.
- |
  

- A year later, in Seattle, I was living in a mess of an old house and slept in a closet.
- |
  

- I met a girl there who played Cat Stevens in the morning and made coffee on a stove.
- |
  

- I began to cry at anything.
- |
  

- It became an initiation for any new girlfriend I would have for the next ten years.
- |
  

- We'd get to know each other, sleep with each other, and then I would turn into a crybaby.
- |
  

- Acid.
- In Spokane I met a friend named Vincent Price, and I had my first acid experience with him.
- |
  

- That night was so much more memorable than the first time I had sex.
- |
  

- Part of the downtown area was sectioned off, and makeshift basketball courts were everywhere.
- |
  

- We found a ball and played in the dark for a few hours, laughing hysterically.
- |
  

- Then, out of nowhere, some kids &#151; they seemed to be about thirteen-years-old &#151; drove up to us in two golf carts.
- |
  

- They offered us rides, and we got in and let them speed us through Riverfront Park on the walking trails.
- |
  

- The headlights weren't too strong, and we almost crashed a few times before they dropped us off by our bikes.
- We rode to a Safeway around five in the morning and bought orange juice, because Vince said it was "good for visuals.
- "\" We sat on the curb outside and watched the painted handicap symbol on the pavement bubble and expand."
- |
  

- It was glorious.
- Around eight in the morning we were finally ready to sleep a little.
- |
  

- We rode our bikes over the little bridges of downtown Spokane.
- |
  

- Our bodies seemed to be humming a song no one else could hear.
