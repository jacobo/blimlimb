- Monday, April 30
- The insulting antics of relentless enemy co-workers continue.
- |
  

- Upon engaging my computer machine this morning, I found my screen saver had been changed from its usual picture of a placid Yellowstone sunset to a disquietingly crude image of late comedian Chris Farley from the movie poster for  Beverly Hills Ninja .
- The personal affronts I am accustomed to by this point, but this cinematic assault on the stealth art I cannot abide.
- |
  

- A fat ninja?
- |
  

- I was incredulous.
- |
  

- Obesity is hardly conducive to "the skill of going unperceived.
- "\" Leave it to those rapscallions in Hollywood to totally besmirch that which is sacred with one simple casting error."
- Out of curiosity, I rented the film.
- |
  

- It had its moments.
- Tuesday, May 1
- The office environment can be a dangerous battleground.
- |
  

- Even for one steeped in the deadly craft of ninjutsu.
- "Kitchen policy states (though in a slightly less eloquent manner): When one removes a cold bottled water from the refrigerator, one must immediately replace it with a room-temperature one from the supply closet, thus ensuring an ample inventory of cold, crisp refreshment for all."
- As would any honorable warrior, I obey at all times the rules put before me.
- |
  

- Yet, last week, receptionist Fran complained to office manager Ken that she had witnessed my transgression of this ordinance.
- |
  

- "Given receptionist Fran's seniority over me\x97and, it is my understanding, her lax sexual tendencies\x97office manager Ken chose to side with her and proceeded to verbally castigate me for a crime I did not commit."
- Damn you, Fran.
- |
  

- I wonder, too, if you will have the audacity to blame me for the now headless family photos affixed to the wall at your work station, cut with the razor-sharp precision only a well-tapered samurai sword can achieve.
- Something tells me no.
- Wednesday, May 2
- Initially, I had considered the prospect of business travel as a potential perk to the sales job.
- |
  

- After my first trip, however, I have discovered this assumption was erroneous.
- Intern Karen, who is responsible for booking all office travel accommodations, approached me two weeks before our scheduled appointment in Phoenix.
- |
  

- "\"Will a Ramada Inn be OK?"
- "\" she inquired."
- |
  

- "\"It's a great deal,\""
- |
  

- "\"Whatever is most financially beneficial to the company,\""
- |
  

- I replied.
- |
  

- "\"OK,\""
- |
  

- "\"in that case, I'll book you a queen suite at the Ramada, and get you on the 7:30 America West flight into Phoenix."
- |
  

- They've got a hub there.
- "\" Feeling excited but slightly emasculated by the prospect of staying in a queen's living quarters, yet embarrassed about not knowing what this \""
- |
  

- "\" was, I was eager to end the conversation."
- |
  

- "\"Fine,\""
- |
  

- I agreed.
- I have battled entire armadas, but never a force as inhuman and unrelentingly evil as the Ramada.
- |
  

- "I had to call six times for extra towels, the air conditioning was broken, and the chair was horribly soft and uncomfortable\x97not at all similar to the rigid chair I sleep in at home."
- "As for the air travel, I cannot summon the words to translate my disgust and displeasure with the egregious delays and terrible in-flight food, and so will just quote fellow salesman and frequent business traveler Ron Rodriguez: \"America Worst."
- Indeed, Ron.
- |
  

- Indeed.
- Thursday, May 3
- During lunchtime conversation with various co-workers, the subject of weaponry was broached.
- |
  

- Being an expert on this matter, I decided to "kick some knowledge," as they say in hip-hop music. Imagine my chagrin when intern Evan inquired as to my expertise on a certain "hand-held apparatus" (his words) I had simply never heard of.
- |
  

- Needless to say, as a ninja, I felt rather ashamed at my ignorance.
- "Mental note: Need to research \"bukkake."
- Friday, May 4
- I.
- I.
- F.
- T.
- G.
- |
  

- It is Friday, thank God.
- |
  

- "I have noticed that on Fridays some of the firm's more indolent employees take premature leave of their duties\x97or \"sneak out early\"\x97in a direct dereliction of their vocational responsibilities."
- Normally, I would never consider such a thing.
- |
  

- After this week, though, I am left with the unbearable urge to leave this place, and am thus deliberating a sneak of my own .
- |
  

- I am fairly certain I won't be caught.
