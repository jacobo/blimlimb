- Holidays
- My birth, death, and high-school graduation should be celebrated with a feast, a day of mourning, and a Sadie Hawkins dance, respectively.
- "The feast should have a \"me\" theme. My favorite foods\x97turkey sandwiches, half-sour pickles, popcorn, and strawberry-rhubarb pie\x97ought to be available in abundance. Please avoid serving cold soups. I find the thought of them hideous. Also, there should be a kids' table where little brothers sit."
- On the day of mourning, the observant should gather to tell sad stories and trade cards with my statistics on the back.

- The person who tells the saddest story will receive the most valuable card and so on down the line.

- The person who tells the least sad story will have to sit in shame with George and the rest of the little brothers at the kids' table.
- At the Sadie Hawkins dance, the women ought to feel a subtle, needling pressure to pick older brothers.

- Billy Joel's "Just the Way You Are" should be played at least twice. All kisses will be French.
- Statues
- I insist that each statue built in my honor be context-sensitive and culturally aware.

- Host communities should dress my likeness in the clothes of the wealthiest and most successful person that anyone in the area has ever heard of.

- If there is a disagreement on who that might be, the tie goes to the most flowing robe.
- |
  

- Under no circumstances can this be George's robe, although, with his broad shoulders, he'd never be able to pull off something really elegant anyway.
- My statue should be cast in the second-most-expensive material available, with the first-most-expensive material reserved for my eyes, which should look woefully understanding.
- |
  

- It should go without saying that I be rendered huge.
- |
  

- If depicted with George, he should be bowing to me in praise.
- Commemorative Coins
- Along with miniature versions of my many statues, the Franklin Mint ought to issue commemorative coins in my honor.
- |
  

- On the front of the coin, I should appear in profile, driving with one hand on the steering wheel.
- |
  

- It ought to be evident that Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Fortunate Son" is playing loudly on the car stereo. The back of the coin should read "E Pluribus Unum.
- "\" Above the text will be a picture of my family in a human pyramid."
- |
  

- I will be standing at the top with my foot on George's head.
- Biographies
- George can't write my biography.
- |
  

- In fact, there should be no  g 's in any of the books that discuss my life.
- |
  

- I leave it to the editors to replace all of them with asterisks or simply rewrite the texts without that letter.
- It's so unfair.
- |
  

- He's had it so easy his whole life.

- "That should definitely be in the books: that I helped him with his homework and his admissions essays."
