- They say that when the October moon is full, and the swamps and meadows are covered with an eerie mist, I will put down my beer and go walking through the streets.
- According to legend, my hair will stick out wildly, from lying on the couch all day.
- |
  

- I will walk with an awkward stagger, my arms held forward.
- |
  

- No one knows why I walk this way.
- |
  

- Some say it is to be ready in case I trip.
- |
  

- Others say it is to make sure I don't go face-first through a spider web.
- When I am abroad on the land, many of the frightened townspeople report hearing a ghastly, bloodcurdling howl.
- |
  

- This is the part of the legend that hurts my feelings the most, because I think they're talking about my singing.
- Some stories claim that if you confront me during my midnight walks and chant, "Jack Handey, Jack Handey, give me some candy," I will give you some candy. Man, forget it. I need that candy.
- I am said to prey upon young lovers, and that if I look into a bedroom window and see them having sex I will stand there and watch with my red, flaming eyes.
- |
  

- But I am not looking for young lovers; I am usually looking for something else, like, I don't know, my lost treasure or something.
- |
  

- If I happen to see two people having sex, I will stay and look, for I am curious about your human ways.
- They say I can turn into a bat.
- |
  

- I can, but not very well.
- |
  

- What I am probably best at is wandering into a party and transforming myself into someone who looks like he might have been invited.
- |
  

- And woe to him who fingers me as an impostor, for he will be greeted by a hideous hissing sound coming from the tires of his car.
- It is whispered that I can suck the blood out of you.
- |
  

- Others say I can start to tell a joke, but then get really confused and not remember where the joke goes, and start over again and again until it drives you mad.
- |
  

- But it's not my fault.
- |
  

- You see, I am the offspring of an unholy union between a man and what people in these parts call a "wo-man.
- Some of the townspeople believe in me, and some don't.
- |
  

- And even some of those who believe are reluctant to loan me money.
- A few say I exist but that I'm actually dead.
- |
  

- As evidence they point to the old gravestone in the cemetery with my name carved on it.
- |
  

- But I have apologized for doing that and agreed to do community service.
- The truth is, I live in a weird netherworld, somewhere between the dead and those guys who are out riding their bikes, doing stuff like that.
- People are always asking me if there's anything they can carry or wear or hold up in front of me that will frighten or repel me.
- |
  

- "I'll be honest with you: just about anything you suddenly hold up is going to frighten me."
- |
  

- About the only thing I can think of that might not is an ice-cream cone, so long as the ice cream isn't in a scary shape.
- How did I come to this curse?
- |
  

- I'll tell you.
- |
  

- I was bitten, bitten by a wolf.
- |
  

- And not an ordinary wolf, but something called a "schnauzer.
- "\" A schnauzer owned by my so-called friend Don."
- |
  

- Ever since then I am compelled to wander the night, like a schnauzer.
- |
  

- Legend says my midnight haunts will never end until I am united with my true love.
- |
  

- The sad thing is, I don't even know her name.
- |
  

- It's that French girl from the movie  Swimming Pool .
- |
  

- But unless I can figure out the area code for France, my love is probably doomed.
- Maybe magically the curse will be lifted.
- |
  

- And I'll get up bright and early and point to myself in the mirror and say, "You're going to do great things today.
- "\" No, wait, that's a different curse."
- And so I stalk.
- |
  

- Usually Friday and Saturday nights are the main times I go stalking, and also, like I said, the moon should be full and mist covering things.
- |
  

- But, to be honest, it could pretty much be any night of the week.
