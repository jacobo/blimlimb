- Dear Beth,
- Yesterday, when I went to the store, there was an old couple waiting for the bus.
- |
  

- Or a ride.
- |
  

- They looked just like your grandparents, so I thought I'd write you a letter.
- |
  

- How are they doing?
- |
  

- Are you having fun?
- |
  

- You kind of rushed out of here, so I hope everything is okay.
- |
  

- Alan
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- Did you accidentally take my blue socks?
- |
  

- I was doing laundry and I can't find them anywhere.
- |
  

- Also, while washing your pants, I found a strange note in the back  pocket.
- |
  

- There was a phone number and a man's name.
- |
  

- Did you cheat on me?
- |
  

- Is that why you ran off?
- |
  

- If you did, I can forgive you.
- |
  

- But you have to tell me.
- |
  

- Dear Beth,
- Did you ever notice how twenty-four hour stores always have locks on the doors?
- |
  

- Ha!
- |
  

- That rhymed!
- |
  

- Alan
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- So, you don't know where my socks are?
- |
  

- And what about this cheating thing.
- |
  

- I just want to know, honey.
- |
  

- I'm just asking.
- |
  

- Maybe you don't want to hurt my feelings.
- |
  

- I can understand that.
- |
  

- Dear Beth,
- I'm very worried about you.
- |
  

- You haven't returned any of my letters.
- |
  

- Do you want me to call?
- |
  

- Alan
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- I found my socks, finally.
- |
  

- They were in the dryer.
- |
  

- I'm wearing them now.
- |
  

- Look, about the cheating thing, it's all right.
- |
  

- Really, it's fine.
- |
  

- I should have been more understanding.
- |
  

- Taken some time to listen to you, or whatever.
- |
  

- I promise, I can be a better person.

  Dear Beth,
  Yesterday, when I went to the store, there was an old couple waiting for the bus. Or a ride. They looked just like your grandparents, so I thought I'd write you a letter. How are they doing? Are you having fun? You kind of rushed out of here, so I hope everything is okay.
  yours always,
  Alan
  P.S. Did you accidentally take my blue socks? I was doing laundry and I can't find them anywhere. Also, while washing your pants, I found a strange note in the back  pocket. There was a phone number and a man's name. Did you cheat on me? Is that why you ran off? If you did, I can forgive you. But you have to tell me.
