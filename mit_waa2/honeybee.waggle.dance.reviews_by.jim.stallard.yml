The hive's authority is rooted in sororicide and matricide! Most of us live merely to work ourselves to death! Etc., etc. The shocking message she conveys is about as original as the arabesque she assumes at the end of her pedestrian dance. The subversive intent is clear enough, but, worker 92483, where is thy sting?"

- "Lopsided loops, inconsistent arcs, haphazard trembling\x97too much noise and not enough signal."
