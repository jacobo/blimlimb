- I wanted to make you a solid writing-table  That would last a lifetime
- |
  

- You sweetly sing of heroes,  Hold your listeners' souls  Cupped in your small hands
- |
  

- I cannot, in feeble words alone,  Express my feelings for you.
- |
  

- Because of you, I  Live again.
- |
  

- Because of you, I  Love again.
- |
  

- She and I slept in each other's arms.
- |
  

- Naked and easy as lovers, a month of nights.
- |
  

- Yet never once made  love.
- |
  

- When at night the dreams  Replay my past,  And the ghosts of the dead  Come to haunt me,  Your laughter strikes
- |
  

- I look up - as if to meet your voice  With all its urgent future  That has burst in on me.
- |
  

- You don't know how your voice soothes my soul  How your tales shield me from my past  Making this road I travel worth everything
- |
  

- Who will remember your fingers?
- |
  

- Their winged life?
- |
  

- They flew  With the light in your look.
- |
  

- A holy law  Had invented itself, somehow, for me.
- |
  

- But she too served it, like a priestess, Tender, kind and stark naked  beside me.
- |
  

- Only I heard a subtle intoxication of want  Trembling flesh, pounding flashing fire  Liquid life so tantalizing just beneath  The soft and pliant skin waiting to be taken.
- |
  

- You are my friend,  my compaion,  my bard.
- |
  

- I know how much  of your life's  been hard.
- |
  

- I want you to stay with me,  and we'll see what we can see.
- |
  

- My friend,  my companion,  my bard.
