- Dear America Online,
- I've tested your freely provided Speech Recognition Software.

- Here I enclosed the transcripts of, first, my typed message and then the transcribed recorded one.
- |
  

- As you can see, the variance is quite fascinating.
- |
  

- I'm frankly torn between demanding better service &#151; or at least forcing you to agree with my lament that only in such free software is the speech recognition so poor, but if I were to spend a lot more money I could get something that really works &#151; to just saying, "Thanks.
- |
  

- I love your translations.
- Best Wishes,
- Ron Grunberg
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- Yes, I followed all your instructions, read into the training program a half-hour text, and added vocabulary words.
- |
  

- Also, I majored in broadcast journalism and worked on the radio for many years.
- |
  

- So don't blame my accent.
- |
  

- I don't have one.
