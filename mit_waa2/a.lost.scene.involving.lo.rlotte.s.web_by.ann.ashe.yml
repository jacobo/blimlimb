- "\"I see where you're going with the 'Some Pig' thing, but don't you think it's so vague that it's not even worth writing?"
- "\" Louis squawked."
- |
  

- "\"I mean, 'Some Pig'\x97sure, and there's  some  geese, and  some  rats\x97it just doesn't convey any real sentiment, does it?"
- |
  

- What reason would it give me, as a pig farmer, to spare Wilbur?
- |
  

- Might as well write 'I Give Up' and be done with it.
- Louis pecked the ground once or twice thoughtfully, then scratched at the loose dirt of the barnyard with his scaly feet.
- |
  

- No one needed a pedicure more than he.
- |
  

- "\"Listen,\""
- |
  

- Louis continued, "if you really want to save Wilbur, maybe you should think about being a little more aggressive.
- |
  

- Send a shiver up their spines, so to speak.
- |
  

- I'm thinking of a good, old-fashioned 'Watch Your Back' in the web, or maybe just 'Die' if that's too much for you to manage.
- |
  

- Though Mr. Zuckerman might take that the wrong way, think you're encouraging killing the pig.
- |
  

- "Or\x97hey!"
- |
  

- That would be sure to keep everyone away from the pigpen.
- "\"I'm not much of an artist,\""
- |
  

- Charlotte.
- The turkey coughed a little.
- |
  

- "\"Yes, well."
- |
  

- You're not much of a writer, either, but that hasn't stopped you yet, has it?
- "\" The other animals stared at Louis with wide, disbelieving eyes, but Charlotte only sighed."
- "\"This has to be done by morning,\""
- |
  

- "\"Yes, I know."
- |
  

- Precious little time, you're only one small spider.
- "\" He rolled his eyes."
- |
  

- "\"I'm so helpless!"
- "\" he mocked while flailing his wings."
- |
  

- "\"With that attitude, you'll never get anything done."
- |
  

- Look, I already have a better idea.
- |
  

- Why not take some of these dead bugs you're done with and dangle them from nooses made of your web?
- |
  

- That's threatening.
- "\"My web is rather sheer."
- |
  

- I don't think the nooses would show.
- Louis took a step back and eyed the web as if studying a painting.
- |
  

- "\"Hm."
- |
  

- In that case, why not throw the bugs at the humans as they pass by?
- |
  

- Or some of this manure.
- "\" He started kicking at whatever piles of manure he could find."
- |
  

- The other animals dodged the feces and ran.
- "\"And how will that save Wilbur?"
- "\" a fleeing lamb asked."
- Louis said, "Huh?
- "\"Thank you for your help, Louis."
- |
  

- I'll take it from here,"
- |
  

- Charlotte said, and began her work, just as the sun started to set.
- |
  

- The next morning, all the animals gathered around Charlotte's glorious web, which was sparkling with dew.
- |
  

- The words "Eat Turkey" glistened in the morning light.
- "\"What's that say?"
- "\" Louis asked."
- "\"'Some Pig,'\""
- |
  

- Charlotte.
