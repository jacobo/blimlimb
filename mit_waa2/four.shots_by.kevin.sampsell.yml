- Field Trip.
- My mom had served up a hundred hot dogs and someone hurt his hand with a firecracker.
- |
  

- My mom often volunteered to help with my fifth-grade outings.
- Summer vacation was just an hour away.
- All the kids got on the bus to head back to school from our trip to Sacajawia Park.
- |
  

- Mom was missing.
- |
  

- I asked my teacher and she said she didn't know where she was.
- Driving up Washington Street on the bus I noticed smoke billowing up from somewhere in my neighborhood.
- |
  

- Seconds later I was yelling at the driver to stop.
- |
  

- I saw the fire fighters spraying at the flames that came out of my bedroom window.
- |
  

- The driver said he wasn't allowed to let me out.
- |
  

- When we got back to the school, a friend's mother drove me to my house, which was badly burned on the top and on the sides by our upstairs bedrooms.
- |
  

- My mom had left the field trip early and was there watching.
- The cause was unknown but I heard someone imply that my older brother Mark was home from school, smoking pot.
- |
  

- I'd seen him and his friends smoke pot once and thought it looked cool; there was this twisted glass thing they used.
- |
  

- We stood outside watching.
- |
  

- Nobody was hurt.
- |
  

- My dad was in the alley screaming something like "Fuck the world!
- It seemed like a lot of people were watching the house become wrecked with fire and water, and when they grew bored of it, they went back home.
- |
  

- Laynee.
- After the house fire, when we lived in the small dirty apartment on Alder Street, there was a ten-year old girl named Laynee who lived with her mom in the apartment above us.
- |
  

- Her mom was never around.
- |
  

- Whenever Dad wasn't rebuilding the old house, he was hanging out with this little girl.
- |
  

- They'd watch TV, go for walks, and play games together; things he'd never do with my brothers or me.
- |
  

- Matt and I were curious what the deal was.
- |
  

- They seemed to be keeping secrets.
- |
  

- I even remember Laynee going to Mass with us once.
- |
  

- We suspected Dad of being a pervert.
- |
  

- Even before Laynee, we noticed how he would always stare at young girls.
- |
  

- We began following them on their walks and watching them through the window curtains when they would watch TV, sitting close together on the couch.
- |
  

- Even Mom sensed something and acted tense whenever Laynee was around.
- |
  

- The whole family, except Dad, of course, began to secretly hate Laynee.
- |
  

- We'd sometimes split up with walkie-talkies and spy from the bushes or trees that lined the alleyways and ditches of our neighborhood.
- |
  

- I don't think we were jealous of them, but on some nights we'd lie in bed and hear sounds from upstairs.
- |
  

- We wondered what was inside her heart.
- |
  

- Chongo.
- The toughest kid at our school was named Chongo, and he was a short but muscular Mexican who always seemed to be suspended or doing Saturday school.
- |
  

- He lived in the pit of this valley that ran alongside a long irrigation pipe.
- |
  

- The pipe was connected to the ditches surrounding our neighborhood and it had a flat surface on top lined with flimsy 2x4s.
- |
  

- For some reason, we always called this pipe "the floons.
- "\" My friends and I would often have races on the floons."
- |
  

- There was an element of danger whenever we did because there were big gaps where you could fall through and go into the dirty water.
- |
  

- And if we went too far down the floons we'd be dangerously close to what we called "
- Chongo Country.
- "\" Other kids had told us that if you got a good look into Chongo Country, you'd see all sorts of stolen bikes and bike parts in his weed-filled yard."
- |
  

- When Chongo had his shirt off, they said, you could see a tattoo of Pontius Pilate across his chest.
- |
  

- We never dared to look.
- |
  

- Braces.
- One of my first girlfriends had braces and thick glasses and was not thought of as pretty or anything acceptable.
- |
  

- In fact, even though I told some friends I had a girlfriend, I made sure no one saw her.
- |
  

- I was sixteen, she was thirteen.
- |
  

- When I had my first car I'd go to her house.
- |
  

- It was nice and big, with a tennis court in back.
- |
  

- I would pick her up and we would drive around and then make out somewhere.
- |
  

- Her breath was always unpleasant; and she had stuff on her braces, like she never brushed her teeth.
- |
  

- Still, I went out of my way to spend time with her and was jealous once when she told me about an ex-boyfriend, an eighteen-year old who had his own apartment, where he wanted her to suck his dick once.
- |
  

- It was a story she told me once with an "I can do anything to you" tone of voice.
- Another time when her parents were gone, we were in her basement.
- |
  

- We took our shirts off on the couch.
- |
  

- I ran my fingers over her small chest, feeling the nipples, no bigger than pimples.
- |
  

- We stood up and slow-danced to a radio song.
- |
  

- I picked her up and put her on the pool table.
- |
  

- We stared at each other.
- |
  

- "\"Do you want to know something I haven't done before?"
- "\" she asked."
- |
  

- I asked her what it was.
- |
  

- "\"I've never had anyone kiss me upside-down,\""
- |
  

- She kicked the cue ball off the table.
