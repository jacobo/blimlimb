- Women who breastfeed in public but then make a big show of hiding it as if I care.
- Total strangers telling me what to do, especially square-dance callers.
- Those pretentious phonies who say "pasta" instead of paste or "Boca Raton" instead of rat's mouth.
- Itchy labels on bungee ankle straps so I itch the whole way down.
- When my opera cape gets caught on homeless people's junk.
- Waiters who recite the specials in a bored singsong voice as if they don't really care  what  I eat.
- Bad art in motel rooms, especially bad performance art.
- When a woman stands near me and people think her ugly baby is mine and it is.
- Dentists who cram my mouth full and don't even ask me one question, though I've been practicing all year.
- Big, conceited bodies of water, especially Lake Superior.
- The depressing attractions at the Svenskfilmindustrie theme park, near Stockholm.
- |
  

- Actually, I may have dreamt this.
- |
  

- When a can of cheap peas says "Pea Color and Size May Vary" and inside there's just one giant blue pea.
- Halloween decorations in a hospice.
- Distant calliope music at night tempting me to forget my duties and run off with the circus and to hell with her orgasm!
- A "nature burger" with fake grill marks painted on it.
- People who know  way  too much about the Merovingians or cheese.
- Prank phone calls like the guy who called me selling light bulbs for the blind.
- |
  

- Ha-ha.
- |
  

- Very funny.
- |
  

- You are  sick , mister.
- Barbecue restaurants with happy pigs on the sign.
- Those foreign guys on the subway who pretend to read newspapers written in gibberish.
- "People on fire\x97they're always asking for favors, even if they hardly know you."
- The way road signs talk to you in that stern, fatherly voice.
- I never seem to meet those cheerful, uncomplicated women you see on tractor-trailer mud flaps.
- When a lecturer takes a drink of water and doesn't offer us any.
- I've been all over the world and have lived among every kind of culture and I can say, without any hesitation, that the most ignorant, rude, selfish, and self-centered people on earth are babies.
