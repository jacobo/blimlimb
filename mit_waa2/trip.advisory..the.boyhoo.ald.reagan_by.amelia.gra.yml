- Before you visit the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan, you should first note that there are, in actuality,  many  Boyhood Homes of Former President Ronald Reagan.
- |
  

- Choose wisely and you will find yourself in the fully restored Boyhood Home that served as a Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan from 1920 to 1923.
- |
  

- It is located in Dixon, Illinois, home of the Petunia Festival.
- "For the purposes of this report, think of the Dixon, Illinois, home\x97where Former President Ronald Reagan spent the ninth, 10th, 11th, and 12th years of his life: essential, formative years\x97as the Definitive Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan and, therefore, as the only Boyhood Home that will be discussed, though he was born above a bakery and surely felt on many occasions the wholesome heat of warm bread."
- Very little of the furniture, carpeting, foundation, and artifacts within the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan is original to the site.
- |
  

- The reason for this is that old things smell terrible.
- Within the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan, you will find Former President Ronald Reagan's Fully Restored Boyhood Bedroom, featuring items you might expect a 9-, 10-, 11-, or 12-year-old boy to have owned between the years of 1920 and 1923.
- |
  

- These items cycle seasonally within the Home and could include baseball cards, autograph books, footballs, and wooden cup-and-ball toys.
- |
  

- While Former President Ronald Reagan never actually touched or considered these actual artifacts, you will be encouraged to observe and consider the objects in terms of their importance to Our Nation's History.
- |
  

- "Think: Would Former President Ronald Reagan have excelled at cup-and-ball, or would he have swung the toy around by its handle and launched it onto the roof, and how might those actions have later affected his Cold War policy?"
- The importance of visiting the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan to your personal life is clear and unchallenged.
- |
  

- "Touring the Home will give you a powerful feeling: You will realize that, in fact, we all had Boyhood or Girlhood homes, and that, though none of us are destined for the greatness that awaited 9-year-old Ronald Reagan, we all have a manner of greatness within us, untapped perhaps for many years, but held there in the heart, like a secret."
- "One part of the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan serves as a centerpiece to visitors and Boyhood Home employees: four pennies, hidden in the spaces in the brick wall."
- |
  

- Former President Ronald Reagan insisted on replacing the pennies at the final ceremonies for the Restored Boyhood Home, and while he replaced the pennies, he told the lucky crowd in attendance that, as a child, he used to hide money in the bricks of that very wall.
- |
  

- Of course, the wall was actually not original, but completely restored, and Former President Ronald Reagan had in fact called ahead to order the workers to leave one brick loose, so that he might tell the story and replace the pennies and please the crowd.
- |
  

- The show was always of paramount importance to Former President Ronald Reagan, and, if visitors concentrate, they might be able to picture an 11-year-old Ronald Reagan hiding the pennies in the bricks of the wall and dreaming of the day that he might place different pennies in restored bricks, put there specially for him, so that he might tell the story.
- It should be noted that the four pennies in the brick within the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan are not the pennies that Ronald Reagan placed within the brick while telling the story at the final ceremonies for the Restored Boyhood Home.
- |
  

- The pennies are actually replica pennies, but are within view of the Actual Pennies Former President Ronald Reagan used during the ceremony.
- |
  

- The Actual Pennies are of great value and are mounted to a plaque over the mantle.
- |
  

- The replica pennies, meanwhile, have their own worth beyond monetary value, for they act as a symbol of a symbol of a very powerful symbol.
- Visitors are advised to take care in preparing for the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan.
- |
  

- All are encouraged to wash their hands before touching doorknobs and rails, to wear shoes with soft soles, and to speak quietly and with reverence.
- |
  

- Visitors are reminded to refrain from flash photography, to not carry in food or drink, and to take the time to respect each orderly room of the Boyhood Home of Former President Ronald Reagan, because it is integral to the history of the world, because it is sacred ground.
