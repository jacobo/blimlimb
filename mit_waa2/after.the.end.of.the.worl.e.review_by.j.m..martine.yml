  Enterprise Carolina sits at edge of the end of the
  world, and she doesn't know it.  These are the first
  few months of the Event:  clocks and timers have
  slowed down, the Swedish rock band Roxette has made a
  comeback, and talking cats are making sporadic
  appearances&nbsp;&#151; also some Seraphim.
  Enterprise Carolina carouses with mountain bikers and
  Hell's Angels.  She wears shitkickers.  After dinner
  she gathers her gang of fellow fifteen-year-olds and
  contemplates vandalism in the half-empty malls of
  Culver City.
  They beat up old men!  They shoplift from The Limited!
   They return shoplifted items to the store and
  (brazenly! brazenly!) demand a smaller size, a larger
  size, a different color!  They stare down older girls
  and giggle at their weight behind their backs!  They
  fill up on samples from the food court!  They loiter
  by the fountain!
  They wear leather and dog-collars, fishnet stockings
  cosmetically torn, heavy mascara, and silver and
  silverette chains with skulls, monkeys, Celtic
  crosses, and the suggestive tongue logo of The Rolling
  Stones.  Their hair is dramatically gelled.  They
  sulk.  They do not like you.
  Their performance is not without problems.
  Enterprise Carolina is a bit too beautiful.  One feels
  uncomfortable with this hyper-eroticized depiction of
  a teenager, balanced as it might be by Carolina's
  dramatic revelation to Lozenge Carmichael&nbsp;&#151; sidekick&nbsp;&#151; that she is a virgin and will remain so until
  married. Carolina is pure and has a heart of gold&nbsp;&#151; is this what we need for the days after the end of the
  world?  Should we not be stepping away from this
  queasy mixture of hard-edged grit and cotton-candy
  idealism?
  And what of the design choices?  Enough with the Mad

  why do we&nbsp;&#151; all of us&nbsp;&#151; feel the need to wear

  whim of mortality.  Fine.  The old men who have been

  writing this review.  Enterprise Carolina will still
  haunt the streets of Culver City&nbsp;&#151; she will march
  under the yellow and red backlit signs of Indian,
  Thai, and Cuban restaurants, and she will walk to Sony
  Studios and make obscene gestures at the movie ads
  (This week:  The Rapture, Or: Wishful Thinkers ), at
  the tourists, at the cats who just can't seem to shut

  It is not overdramatic, however, to rhapsodize about
  Enterprise Carolina's beauty&nbsp;&#151; to say that she will

  has enthralled us.  That she is remarkable in a time
  that is anything but.
  Five stars.  Five golden stars.  Five golden stars and
  my heart.
