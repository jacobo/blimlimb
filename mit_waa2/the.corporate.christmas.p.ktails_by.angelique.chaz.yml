- Vodka Martini
- What is your problem?
- |
  

- You're taking sips out of me like a watered-down Big Gulp in the middle of summer.
- |
  

- Easy, lady.
- |
  

- Easy!
- |
  

- If we're going to make it through this night together with any class you're going to need to slow down.
- |
  

- That's it.
- |
  

- Stir the olive around me with detached coolness and gaze thoughtfully into your date's eyes.
- |
  

- You're in control.
- |
  

- You're the girl in the movies everyone wants to seduce.
- |
  

- Say something charming.
- |
  

- Maybe something like, "You're a lucky boy to have me as a date tonight.
- "\" Wink at him to show that despite your cool confidence, you're still down-to-earth enough to scrape out the change from underneath the driver's seat of your car."
- Well, don't drop the olive on the floor.
- |
  

- God damn it!
- |
  

- There is no way this aloofness is going to work with olive juice on the front of your dress.
- |
  

- Chardonnay
- Oh, sweetie.
- |
  

- You're hurting me with this grip of yours.
- |
  

- Why don't you try holding me with just one hand instead of two?
- |
  

- Good job.
- |
  

- Now, let your left hand go and use it to make animated motions while telling a story.
- |
  

- You do have a story, don't you?
- |
  

- Something to liven up all of this financial talk and hierarchical kowtowing?
- |
  

- Nothing?
- |
  

- OK, OK.
- |
  

- Well, just stand there and smile.
- |
  

- Try to stop adjusting your strapless bra when you think no one's looking.
- |
  

- And it wouldn't hurt you to laugh a little more, either.
- |
  

- I realize your feet hurt and your date is ignoring you but no one wants to be around an acrimonious bore.
- Tell the story about how you just celebrated your younger sister's birthday at a country-and-western bar in North Carolina.
- |
  

- Leave out the part about how you fell off the mechanical bull and sprained the lower part of your back.
- |
  

- Vodka Martini
- Is that Chardonnay I smell on you?
- |
  

- Are you kidding me?
- |
  

- Do you have any idea what's going to happen when you mix me with cheap wine?
- |
  

- Oh, good God.
- |
  

- "OK, new plan: Stop trying to be cool and confident and switch to being demure and quiet."
- |
  

- I don't know why you think everyone wants to hear you talk so much now.
- |
  

- You didn't have a thing to say an hour ago.
- Excuse me?
- Did I really just hear you say that "Howard Zinn is the only historian who can accurately assess the breakdown in communication between the corporate elite and the working middle class?
- "\" You do realize that you have no idea who Howard Zinn is, don't you?"
- |
  

- Just because you read a passing reference Eddie Vedder made about him in Spin magazine does not mean you have any right to discuss him in public.
- Stop talking.
- |
  

- Stop talking immediately.
- |
  

- Vodka Martini
- Your date hates you.
- |
  

- He has now forgotten that you're here and is flirting with his co-worker and ex-girlfriend.
- |
  

- More than likely he will leave you here, drunk, and go home with one of the two.
- |
  

- Your only hope is to exit after you finish listening to this tall guy with the shiny red tie discuss his views on the changing health care system in America.
- |
  

- Try to nod occasionally and pretend you understand what he's saying.
- |
  

- That's it.
- |
  

- You're doing fine.
- |
  

- Refrain from using any words that have the letter "s" in them as they are drawing more attention to your noticeable slur.
- Do not make stabbing motions at the olives with your toothpick!
- |
  

- Water
- Crying?
- |
  

- Why are you crying here in the lobby by yourself?
- |
  

- Oh, no.
- |
  

- Smooth down your dress and wipe the mascara off your chin.
- |
  

- Yes, it's on your chin.
- |
  

- I don't know how it got there, either.
- |
  

- Much better.
- |
  

- Now take a long sip of me and walk slowly toward the coatroom to retrieve your jacket.
- |
  

- You're doing fine.
- |
  

- Oops!
- |
  

- No big deal!
- |
  

- I don't think anyone saw you trip.
- |
  

- Now, keep walking until the nice lady behind the door in the coatroom gives you your jacket.
- |
  

- Find the last $10 in your purse and have it ready to give the cab driver on your way home.
- |
  

- When you arrive home, wash your face and give yourself a long, judgmental stare in your bathroom mirror.
- Make a promise that you will never go to another company Christmas party again.
