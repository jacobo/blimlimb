  Hey Chris! My name's Amanda a.k.a. Squeek.\n\
  full of tender lovin'? Damn right baby!:)... A great personality:  What a\n\
  koinkidink.\n\
  So you wanna be a lion tamer huh? Well that's good cause I need some\n\
  taming!GRRRR REAR!\n\
  I hope to go to the  Fire Academy at Texas A&M University in College\n\
  Station, Texas or to Harvard to become a Pediactric Cardiologist.\n\
  my biggest pet peeve is when people ask you what time it is when there's\n\
  a big clock right there on the wall.  it's like, \"what time is it?\"  and\n\
  i'm like, \"excuse me?  i couldn't hear you, that ticking from the clock\n\
  right behind you drowned out your voice.\"  it gets on my nerves so bad. \n\
  another one of my pet peeves is when mexicans run their mouths 90 miles\n\
  an hour right behind you on the bus from the time they get on it, to the\n\
  time they get off it.  they don't even stop to breath.  i hate that cuz\n\
  i don't know what they're talking about and it sounds so stupid.  it's\n\
  like, \"jib a shait ye ret hou frogesca igj aleowei.\"  i have no idea\n\
  what that means....i wanna be a pediatrician when i grow up, but all my\n\
  friends said that they'd never bring their kids to me because they'd be\n\
  afraid i'd kill 'em or something.\n\
  I was just talking to one of my frends yesterday about how i wanted a\n\
  guy that I'd be with for a long time and who would like me for who I\n\
  am.  You totally fit that description.  This is so weird.  i hope we\n\
  keep contact.  Do you have a girlfriend?\n\
  your letter was so sweet it almost made me cry.  i just called my friend\n\
  and told her all about you.  she thinks you are my \"romeo\".\n\
  Fave Flick: The Wedding Singer. It's romantic, funny, and a great\n\
  make-out all in one.\n\
