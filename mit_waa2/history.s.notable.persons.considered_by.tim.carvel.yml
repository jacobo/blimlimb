  Sigmund Freud
  Perhaps, contrary to a century's worth of psychoanalytic tradition, Freud never meant to suggest that all men want to sleep with their mothers. Perhaps he meant to suggest that all men want to sleep with his mother. (Apparently, Mrs. Freud got around.)
  Bruce Springsteen
  If, through some freak electrical mishap, Bruce Springsteen's clothing were to be ignited while he was onstage at a concert, how many times would he have to shriek, "I'm on fire!" before his bandmates realized that he was not offering a reinterpretation of one of his greatest hits, but a plea for assistance?

  Tom Jones
  There must be nights, when Tom Jones is singing "What's New Pussycat?" for the 5,000th time, and the women are shrieking like they do every night, and a hail of panties is landing on the stage like thousands of times before, when he just thinks, "Man, I'm getting sick of this." That's what I tell myself, anyway.
  Vincent Van Gogh

  J.D. Salinger
  Precisely how much of the joy one takes in reading J.D. Salinger's work comes from the knowledge that he has chosen to withdraw from the public eye for the past five decades? The books would be no less beautiful&#151;not a word would change&#151;but if, for instance, Salinger had spent the past few years drawing a paycheck as a staff writer for  Vanity Fair , mightn't that dim the appeal of  Franny and Zooey  just a bit? Or what if he'd written four sequels to  The Catcher in the Rye ? What if he'd been, however briefly, the host of a late-night talk show? A guest on  The Muppet Show ? The center square on  Hollywood Squares ?
