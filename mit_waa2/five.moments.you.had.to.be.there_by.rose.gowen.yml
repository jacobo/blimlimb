- I was at a concert recently, a concert of Renaissance viol music.

- At  intermission a very small, elegantly dressed old lady was walking in the row behind me toward the aisle.

- As she passed behind me I heard a very wet  farting sound.
- |
  

- I turned to see if someone was making the noise with their  mouth, and if so, why.
- |
  

- Judging by the reaction of a couple of college kids,  who were busting up with silent laughter behind the old lady's back, I  deduced that she had made the sound.
- You had to be there though, because the funny thing was, not only did the violists play five (!) William Byrd pieces in a row, but they also played them about one and a half times faster than is customary, and their singer was not a soprano, but a mezzo.

- I was in the passenger seat of my boyfriend's car and he was driving.
- |
  

- He said, "I don't think we're going to make this light.
- "\" So I said, \""
- Awww,"   starting my voice up at a slightly higher than my normal medium pitch and bringing it down, the way you do to express disappointment.
- |
  

- But then we just barely made the light, so right away I turned my voice around to utter an exultant "Yes!"
- The really hilarious part was when we got home and split about half a gallon of whisky then passed out on the living room floor with all the lights on.
- |
  

- I went into my supervisor's office to look at a file.
- |
  

- I was about to turn around and return to my office when my supervisor said, "Rose, I'm glad I caught you, we put some prisoners in your office, so you'll have to wait here for a few minutes.
- "\" I said, \""
- Oh!
- |
  

- "\" and we both stood there, chuckling."
- You had to be there.
- |
  

- This was the third batch of prisoners in my office that day.
- |
  

- I was trotting up some stairs and I tripped and grazed my knuckles.
- |
  

- I was not seriously hurt.
- |
  

- I turned around to see if anyone had seen me fall, and this girl said, "Are you alright?
- "\" She may have been trying to suppress laughter, it was hard to tell."
- There's this abstract tile work, right where I fell, and if you squint at this one part, at an angle, it looks like a little dog.
- |
  

- At least I always thought, and I guess this girl did too.
- |
  

- I went to use the bathroom across the hall from the office where I work.
- |
  

- Outside the door I heard a loud whooshing sound.
- |
  

- Inside the whooshing sound  was even louder.
- |
  

- The toilet was flushing endlessly.
- |
  

- It looked like a  whirlpool and it was spitting water all over the toilet seat and the floor.
- |
  

- I decided to use the bathroom downstairs.
- My boss likes to tell a really good joke about an octopus, a mermaid, and a one-legged sea captain.
