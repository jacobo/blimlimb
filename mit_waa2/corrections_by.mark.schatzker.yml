  Yesterday, I incorrectly stated that Mike was a
  "dickhead." This statement was made to a group of
  people that Mike was not among; however, he was present
  at the party. Although Mike has a tendency, to break
  social engagements and use his friends for material
  and
  social gain, and although ever since he was called to
  the bar he's become incredibly self-important yet also
  very boring, he is not a "dickhead." I regret the
  error.
  Last Tuesday, I incorrectly concluded that my glass of
  orange juice (from concentrate) would be less thick
  and pulpy and more refreshing if I cut it with an
  equal amount of water. It was not. The amount of water
  added was too great and the orange juice tasted weak.
  The experience of drinking it was unpleasant, although
  in the end it did quench my thirst. I regret the
  error.
  A month ago, I borrowed a friend's car and, as a
  gesture, filled the tank. Instead of filling it with
  premium, I incorrectly filled it with regular and my
  friend could tell just by driving it, even though I
  lied repeatedly, assuring him that it was filled with
  premium. The episode strained our relationship and the
  ensuing tension between us still has not gone away. I
  regret the error.
  When I was in grade ten, I incorrectly believed that
  Leslie Davies was not interested in making out when we
  spent at least two hours talking in Dave Jefferson's
  sister's bedroom (it was Dave Jefferson's party) with
  the lights off and the door closed, both of us lying
  on the bed. A conversation between her best friend and
  my best friend on the subsequent Wednesday proved the
  error of my belief, but the opportunity was never
  again repeated. This was the first in a long,
  tragically repeating history of missed romantic and
  sexual opportunities in which I have been consistently
  blind to the signs of female erotic interest. I regret
  the error.
  When I was 11, I was playing catch with my brother. We
  were using a hardball, even though my mother forbade
  hardballs due to their being dangerous. I remember one

  Earlier, I incorrectly stated that Mike was not a
