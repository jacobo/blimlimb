  NEXT SEASON'S BLOCKBENDERS
  BY MARK O'DONNELL
  (Attorney General Janet Reno and the FCC have asked Hollywood to
  voluntarily impose new regulations limiting violence in films --  USA
  Today )
  The Complicator
  Inconvenience runs rampant when the robotic Complicator (Arnold
  Schwarzenegger) comes back from the future to prevent the romances that
  will lead to the birth of four actors who have revived *Beatlemania* in
  the otherwise peaceful twenty-first century. He traps Christian Slater
  in a dressing room at the Gap on the afternoon he otherwise would have
  proposed to Ally Sheedy, whose short-tempered character breaks up with
  him and therefore never gives birth to "Paul." The Complicator also
  manages to get Corey Haim on jury duty during spring break, disguises
  himself as a hairdresser to convince Kathryn Harrold that her sweetheart
  (D.B. Sweeney) is "too lightweight", and hypnotizes neo-hippie Drew
  Barrymore into believing the world is overpopulated and she should not
  have children (at which point Schwarzenegger utters the
  soon-to-be-classic line, "Adios, 'Ringo!'")
  Uncomfortable Acquaintance
  Glenn Close and Glenn Frey (in the first Glenn-to-Glenn romance on the
  mainstream screen) portray well-meaning but edgily neurotic people in a
  big city (The Jackson Five). They are introduced at a party, forget all
  about it, and then keep running into each other without remembering the
  other's name, to embarassing results. Close's character snaps at clumsy
  waiters a few times, so we wonder what she's going to do to Glenn if he
  forgets her name again, even though she's not so hot with names herself.
  It's an illness, really. In a climax sure to make the blood run on the
  cool side, Glenn (director Adrian Lyne won't say *which *Glenn) finally
  insists they figure out a mnemonic way to remember each other's names.
  I Slapped Hitler
  An intellectually-enhanced Mickey Rourke and the young Clint Eastwood
  (courtesy the new psychibooster and retro-morphing technologies,
  respectively) star in this World War Two thriller about the Marines'
  Attractive Misfit Corps, who, in collaboration with the French
  underground (Gerard Depardieu, in a double role), decide Hitler (played
  by himself in a bid for a comeback) has gone too far and must be
  reprimanded. Bruce Dern (as is) portrays a specially paroled American
  convict (imprisoned after a five-state slapping spree) whom the team
  recruits to give the Feuhrer his comeuppance. Disguised as shopgirls,
  they conceal themselves in a Berlin candy shop where Hitler comes to buy
  Werther's Original butter candies. Suspense mounts, though only to a
  guaranteed bearable pitch, as no one knows when Dern will start to slap
  his colleagues or cackle too loudly from beneath the counter.
  Ironically, when the big moment arrives, Dern's tortured character slaps
  not only Hitler but himself -- the most intense self-administered slap
  in screen history, promises producer Tony Bill (Barry Diller).
  Dead to the World
  Jean Claude Van Damme plays a tired wholesale shampoo salesman who
  knocks people unconscious in hotels all over Asia in his quest for a
  good night's sleep. Late night revelers, noisy motorcyclists, and even
  an arguing pair of con men (Cheech and Chong) all "meet the Sandman," as
  Van Damme's character exhorts them before he slugs them (always
  observing the new One Punch limit). Censors are still debating the
  inclusion of a scene in which Van Damme fires his legally borrowed
  Wildlife Department tranquilizer gun at a compulsively trombone-playing
  Joan Chen.
  Detained!
  Robert Altman directs five interwoven plots of late-comers to a brunch,
  and what kept them, in what he dubs a "social disaster" movie. Jeff and
  Beau Bridges have to coax a napping cat out of their car's engine block;
  Melanie Griffith gets talking on the phone and just can't get off; Julie
  Hagerty and Charles Grodin get lost in a strange neighborhood and
  tensely resolve to try their Spanish skills to ask directions; Demi
  Moore must rush her young daughter (Rumer Willis) to the hospital after
  the child swallows a rhinestone; and Daniel Day-Lewis is kidnapped by
  terrorists who threaten to kill him, although this last episode is
  handled in a light, bumbling style that implies everything will work out
  fine. The climactic brunch will be presented in the new Olfact-o-round
  process in an effort to attract the Foodie crowd.
  The Sweetz on the Streetz
  This debut feature by fifteen-year-old Fonzel Cripes shows the dangers
  and the unexpected beauties of driving a Mister Tas-Tee Truck through
  the mean streets of Carmel. Rodney Allen Rippy plays a troubled adult
  who has lost both his parents when they moved to Miami and stopped
  supporting him, and in desperation (he auditions for TV commercials and
  is told he's no good) turns to selling "snack." Rival ice-cream drivers
  Ben and Jerry (Dennis Hopper and Steve Guttenberg) tease him mercilessly
  for his watery product, cloying logo and insipid recorded chimes, until
  Rippy can take no more, and, after a frozen custard fight Hollywood
  hopes won't inspire "copycat" mayhem in school cafeterias, he enrolls in
  dog grooming school. Rapper Mista Tas-Tee (no relation) provides the
  theme, "Milk N Suga', Whip N Go."
