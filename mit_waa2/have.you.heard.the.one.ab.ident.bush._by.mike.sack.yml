- A traveling businessman walks into a bar and orders a drink.
- |
  

- After a few sips, the businessman looks up, sees President Bush on the television, and yells, "Now there's the biggest horse's ass I've ever seen!
- A customer walks over to the businessman and slugs him.
- |
  

- The businessman stands, brushes himself off, and sits back at the bar.
- A few minutes later, as the businessman is finishing another beer, Mrs. Bush appears on the television.
- |
  

- "\"She's a horse's ass, too,\""
- |
  

- This time, another customer walks over to the businessman and knocks him off his stool.
- "\"This must be Bush country!"
- "\" exclaims the businessman, shaken."
- "\"Nope,\""
- |
  

- "\"Horse country!"
- The bar resounds with laughter and then, just as quickly, fills with silence.
- After what seems like an eternity, the businessman, still on the ground, quips, "You all think you're so funny.
- |
  

- I haven't worked since last April.
- |
  

- The family's house is being repossessed, I threw out my back last year, and despite the few hundred dollars in Bush tax cuts, I can't afford health care for my sick wife.
- |
  

- I'm new to town and could use some friends.
- |
  

- And this is how I'm treated!
- "\" At this, the businessman begins to weep."
- "\"I'm sorry, friend,\""
- |
  

- "\"I was just trying to lighten the mood, I don't even like horses!"
- |
  

- Besides, my own wife is terribly sick and I, too, can hardly afford health care.
- |
  

- So here, let me buy you a drink, OK?
- "\"All right, then,\""
- |
  

- "\"But make it a double, for I am in some serious pain."
- |
  

- Two rednecks, Jesse and Billy Bob, are fishing by moonlight next to a sparkling stream in the pristine wilderness.
- Jesse turns to Billy Bob and asks, "What does a blonde owl say?
- After thinking for a long moment, Billy Bob replies, "I don't know, Jesse.
- |
  

- Tell me.
- At which Jesse impishly declares, "What!
- |
  

- What!
- There is no laughter, just the gentle rushing of the stream and, in the distance, the high-pitched chirping of crickets.
- "\"Get it?"
- "\" asks Jesse, pulling nervously at his overalls."
- |
  

- "\"Instead of 'Who!"
- |
  

- Who!
- |
  

- "\"My wife is a blonde,\""
- |
  

- Billy Bob, taken aback.
- |
  

- "\"You knew that."
- |
  

- Why, of all things, a blonde joke?
- "\"I'm sorry, my mind is on other things,\""
- |
  

- Jesse.
- |
  

- "\"Can't think straight."
- |
  

- The election, it's been gnawing at me.
- "\"Well, it's been gnawing at me, too,\""
- |
  

- Billy Bob, "but I'm not making asinine jokes.
- "\"No, you're not,\""
- |
  

- Jesse.
- |
  

- "\"Again, sorry."
- "\"Do you think the Democrats have any chance of competing with Bush?"
- "\" asks Billy Bob."
- |
  

- "\"I mean, any chance at all?"
- With pitch-perfect timing, Jesse retorts, "Don't know.
- "\"Don't know, either,\""
- |
  

- Billy Bob, smiling or grimacing, one cannot be sure.
- |
  

- "\"I really don't know."
- The two rednecks continue to fish.
- |
  

- President Bush visits his doctor for the results of a brain scan.
- The doctor, looking very serious, says, "Mr. President, I have some bad news for you.
- |
  

- "We have learned, through extensive medical testing, that your brain has two sides: the left side and the right side."
- President Bush, slightly frightened, asks, "But that's normal, isn't it?
- |
  

- I thought everybody has two sides to their brain.
- With a gleam in his eye, the doctor jibes, "That's true, Mr. President.
- |
  

- But your brain is very unusual, because on the left side there isn't anything right, while on the right side there isn't anything left!
- President Bush does not laugh, but rather looks perplexed.
- |
  

- "\"Why are you joking?"
- |
  

- This is a medical examination.
- |
  

- Is this a laughing matter to you?
- The doctor, without missing a beat, rejoins, "I have a brother in Iraq, in the Marines.
- |
  

- He was almost killed in Falluja last week.
- |
  

- That's three times in one month.
- |
  

- I love him dearly, and want nothing more than for him to come home safe.
- |
  

- It's not right for me to tease, but this is how I cope best under tremendous pressure.
- |
  

- The whole country seems a little down in the dumps.
- |
  

- Maybe we should all joke more.
- "Thinking for a moment, the president comes back with the following snap: \"I understand completely."
- |
  

- I hope he remains safe.

  "Nope," the bartender zings. "Horse country!"

  "All right, then," cracks the businessman, slowly and painfully making his way back to a standing position. "But make it a double, for I am in some serious pain."
