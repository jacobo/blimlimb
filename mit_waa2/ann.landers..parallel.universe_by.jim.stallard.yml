- "Dear Readers:"
- I'm on vacation this week, so I thought I'd run some of my favorite gems  you've sent me over the years.
- |
  

- "Dear Ann:"
- "This is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard, passed on to me by my  cousin: A housewife was in her basement doing her laundry when she realized  the nightgown she was wearing also needed washing."
- |
  

- She stripped it off and  continued with her housework, but when she returned, still nude, to move the  clothes to the dryer, she saw that a pipe overhead was dripping.
- |
  

- Not wanting  to ruin the fancy hairdo she had gotten for a dinner party that night, she  picked up her son's football helmet and put it on as she transferred the  clothes.
- |
  

- When she turned around, she was startled to see a man from the  electric company reading the meter.
- |
  

- As he turned to head up the stairs, the  man did not even glance at her but in a deadpan voice made a suggestion so  lewd and vulgar that the woman was humiliated.
- |
  

- "Dear Ann:"
- I hope you have room to print just one more of those "how we met" stories. I  was a young woman growing up in Bombay, adventurous, strong-willed and  determined not to settle down until I had seen the world. One night while  attending a small gathering at a neighbor's home, I saw a stoop-shouldered,  plain-looking man of about 25 standing at the side of the room holding a  drink and not talking to anyone. When I walked up and tried to start a  conversation with him, he handed me his empty drink and motioned to the  bottle of wine sitting in the corner. As I was refilling his cup, I asked my  father in a whisper who this rude, arrogant person was. "That's Rajiv Sankar,  the man you're going to marry," he replied.
- |
  

- "\"It was arranged between our  families right after your birth."
- |
  

- You should get used to waiting on him.
- "\"  Well, Ann, I've been at his service for 40 years, and we've never been  apart&#151;not even after I brought shame on him twice by giving birth to baby  girls."
- |
  

- "Dear Ann:"
- Here's a story that gives you an idea of how things have changed in this  country.
- |
  

- An elderly man was crossing a downtown street when he entered an  area marked off by yellow tape and sawhorses.
- |
  

- Six men in city maintenance  uniforms were leaning on their shovels chatting away, seemingly in no rush to  fill a gaping pothole with black tar that was quickly cooling in the  container at their feet, next to a sign that read "Caution, Men at Work.
- "\"  As  the old gentleman passed between the men, one of them snapped at him, \""
- Watch  where you're going.
- |
  

- Can't you read the sign?
- "\" The elderly man stopped and  stood with hands on hips, looking slowly from the sign to the group of men."
- |
  

- He then hurried on meekly, too embarrassed to admit that he did not know how  to read.
- |
  

- "Dear Ann:"
- This really happened in a town near mine and never fails to bring me a  chuckle.
- |
  

- A woman frantically rushed into an emergency room with one palm  pressed against the back of her head.
- |
  

- She claimed she had been shot from  behind while driving her car and that she had driven to the hospital with one  hand while using the other to keep her brains from spilling out.
- |
  

- The  emergency team reacted quickly, knowing how precious each bit of brain tissue  was to the woman's functioning in the future.
- |
  

- Soon enough, however, they were  able to piece together what had actually happened.
- |
  

- The woman had been to the  supermarket and placed her groceries in the back seat of her car, which was  very hot from sitting in the sun.
- |
  

- As she was driving home, a bullet  apparently fired from at least a half-mile away passed through the glass in  her back window and had just enough velocity to enter the scalp at the back  of her skull.
- |
  

- The "brains" that the woman thought she was holding in was  actually just a mixture of blood and cerebrospinal fluid!

  Dear Ann:
  This is one of the funniest stories I've ever heard, passed on to me by my 
  cousin: A housewife was in her basement doing her laundry when she realized 
  the nightgown she was wearing also needed washing. She stripped it off and 
  continued with her housework, but when she returned, still nude, to move the 
  clothes to the dryer, she saw that a pipe overhead was dripping. Not wanting 
  to ruin the fancy hairdo she had gotten for a dinner party that night, she 
  picked up her son's football helmet and put it on as she transferred the 
  clothes. When she turned around, she was startled to see a man from the 
  electric company reading the meter. As he turned to head up the stairs, the 
  man did not even glance at her but in a deadpan voice made a suggestion so 
  lewd and vulgar that the woman was humiliated.
