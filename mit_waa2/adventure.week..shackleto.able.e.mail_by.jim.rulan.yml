- Wyndham,
- Well I've done it this time.
- |
  

- I woke this morning to find the  Endurance  firmly stuck in the pack ice.
- |
  

- If no leads open soon we'll simply have to wait the winter out and hope she holds.
- |
  

- I know it's shameful of me to stay locked up in my quarters surfing the Web while the men do all the work, but I can't help myself.
- |
  

- Have you seen the binnacles on this Jennifer Love Hewitt wench?
- |
  

- Reminds of a girl I used to fancy at that detestable little hole you took me to in Wapping.
- |
  

- Madam S___'s was it?
- Thunderstruck,
- ES
- |
  

- Windy,
- Very distressful day.
- |
  

- I found a member of the ship's company in a compromising position with one of the dogs (Sheila).
- |
  

- I reprimanded him in private so as not to embarrass him in front of the men.
- |
  

- Do you suppose I did the right thing?
- Cheers,
- ES
- BTW, the  Gladiator  DVD is bloody marvelous!
- |
  

- Windy,
- Sorry I haven't written.
- |
  

- Wild keeps pestering me about his E-Trade account and Hurley prattles endlessly about Premier League Football.
- |
  

- We didn't have time for such nonsense when I was cutting my teeth with the North Western Shipping Company.
- |
  

- Sometimes I feel as if I'm trapped in a giant pram, going from baby to baby to ensure they haven't soiled themselves.
- |
  

- Why, Windy, didn't I listen to you when you urged me to take a job with a packet company and spend my days in peace and comfort ferrying bluebloods to Le Havre?
- Best,
- ES
- |
  

- Windy,
- I've been e-mailing an intellectual property lawyer in New York and he feels our correspondence could compromise my plan to publish the greatest adventure saga of all time.
- |
  

- He says that any premature publication of my letters could be very damaging.
- |
  

- I've assured him you would never do such thing, but you know how these Yankees are.
- |
  

- Do be a good chap and delete these messages after you've had a chance to read them over and reflect on their extraordinary literary merit.
- Ernest
- |
  

- Windy,
- I suppose you're quite cross with me.
- |
  

- I don't know what I was thinking.
- |
  

- Please forgive me.
- |
  

- Of course you needn't delete this rubbish.
- |
  

- Last night while I was pacing the foredeck, the incessant baying of the dogs bewitching accompaniment to the southern lights, I had a brilliant idea.
- |
  

- I want you to organize an Internet chat for me on Yahoo or possibly Salon.
- |
  

- It might go a long way toward keeping me in the public's eye.
- |
  

- I'm a celebrity, by Jove, and I need to act like one, even when all I feel up to is brewing a cup of Celestial Seasonings Captain's Courageous Tea and listening to the new Coldplay CD on my Sony Discman.
- |
  

- Do you think you could arrange something to that effect?
- |
  

- In fact, you might even consider approaching Ms. Hewitt about this.
- |
  

- A little star power might be just the thing!
- |
  

- Do write back and tell me what you think.
- Your friend,
- Ernest
- P.
- S.
- |
  

- Would you be so kind as to forward my personal e-mail address at polarboyo@yahoo.
- |
  

- Ms. Hewitt?
- |
  

- That would be rather extraordinary of you.
- ES
- |
  

- Windy,
- Well whoever said you can't teach an old dog new tricks never summered in the polar ice with British seamen.
- |
  

- I'm afraid my randy sailor was at it again with Sheila last night.
- |
  

- Quite disgraceful.
- |
  

- It stirred me from a most remarkable dream.
- |
  

- I was travelling alone across the ice with a fierce gale blowing at my back.
- |
  

- "I happened upon a cave and was greeted by a heavenly site: Ms Hewitt bedecked in a dazzling white seal-fur bikini."
- |
  

- She commanded me to undress and we tantalized each other by rubbing hot blubber all over our bodies.
- |
  

- Exquisite creature.
- |
  

- Nipples like cleats on a bollard.
- |
  

- Saucy, saucy wench, indeed!
- You must think me rather filthy, Windy, but I can't help myself.
- |
  

- Aren't I awful?
- Yours,
- Wicked, wicked Ernie
- |
  

- Wyndham,
- I just received an e-mail from the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition Help Desk and they have informed me that the server is fine.
- |
  

- I can only interpret your silence as a condemnation of my character.
- |
  

- Please know that my intentions toward Ms Hewitt are entirely admirable.
- |
  

- I'm certain she will be to delighted to count a stalwart explorer and literary celebrity of my stature among her admirers.
- |
  

- Let us put this petty squabble behind us.
- Your old friend,
- Ernest
- |
  

- Windy,
- I must keep this brief.
- |
  

- The  Endurance  is swamped and will go under soon.
- |
  

- All nonessential items will be left here to be swallowed up by the ice.
- |
  

- This includes, I'm afraid, my Apple Macintosh PowerBook G4/400 128Mb.
- |
  

- Henceforth I will have to scratch my notes in a journal like a common wretch.
- |
  

- This would upset me more if it were not for the all-too-real possibility I shall never return.
- |
  

- I did not expect it to end like this, if the end indeed it be.
- |
  

- Total disasterville.
- Crushed,
- Ernest
