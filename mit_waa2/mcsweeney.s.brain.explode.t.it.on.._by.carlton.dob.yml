- Throughout the first month of the Brain Exploder we've had hundreds of correct answers to BE puzzles.

- It makes most of us glad to know McSweeney's readers are so intelligent, but one person at BE HQ is pissed.

- His name is Tom.
- |
  

- Tom thinks it's time for an old-fashioned Pittsburgh Puzzle Parry-In-A-Pen Match, and for reasons we won't go into here, it's company policy to keep Tom either happy or constantly occupied with long errands to the suburbs.
- So here's this week's Exploder with little explanation and few instructions.
- |
  

- The first person who can tell us what the numbers and letters below refer to, represent, or have in common with each other will receive two McSweeney's books.
- |
  

- Anyone who wants a clue can request one by email from  carltondoby@hotmail.
- |
  

- Parry-In-A-Pen title and grand prize.
- |
  

- If no one can crack the puzzle without receiving a hint, an entrant will be chosen from all correct (hint-aided) answers to win one McSweeney's book.
- |
  

- As always, Brain Exploder contestants are on the honor system.
- |
  

- All entries must be received by Friday at midnight.
- |
  

- Answers, as always, should be sent to  carltondoby@hotmail.

  Throughout the first month of the Brain Exploder we've had hundreds of correct answers to BE puzzles. It makes most of us glad to know McSweeney's readers are so intelligent, but one person at BE HQ is pissed. His name is Tom. Tom thinks it's time for an old-fashioned Pittsburgh Puzzle Parry-In-A-Pen Match, and for reasons we won't go into here, it's company policy to keep Tom either happy or constantly occupied with long errands to the suburbs.
  So here's this week's Exploder with little explanation and few instructions. The first person who can tell us what the numbers and letters below refer to, represent, or have in common with each other will receive two McSweeney's books. Anyone who wants a clue can request one by email from  carltondoby@hotmail.com , but they will be ineligible for the Parry-In-A-Pen title and grand prize. If no one can crack the puzzle without receiving a hint, an entrant will be chosen from all correct (hint-aided) answers to win one McSweeney's book. As always, Brain Exploder contestants are on the honor system. All entries must be received by Friday at midnight. Answers, as always, should be sent to  carltondoby@hotmail.com .
  And so, courtesy of Tom, here is this week's puzzle:
