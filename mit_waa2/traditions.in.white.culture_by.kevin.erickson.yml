- First, each housemate is weighed and the results are recorded on the underside of separate toads, which are then set free within the house.

- Next, the forearm of each housemate is measured from elbow to wrist, and each measurement is recorded on a separate spool of thread.
- |
  

- "Then, each housemate puts on a woolen sweater embroidered with a macram\xE9 flower."
- |
  

- The spools of thread are placed inside a pillowcase and each housemate draws one.
- |
  

- The number recorded on the spool is the length in leagues of wool yarn that is unwound from the bottom of that housemate's woolen sweater.
- |
  

- The housemate then uses that yarn to create a partition in the home, within which the housemate is entitled to roam.
- |
  

- At noon the next day, each housemate collects the toads that are in his or her partition and adds the weights on their bellies together.

- The percentage that this amount represents of the combined weight of all the housemates is calculated, and that is the percentage of the rent that housemate is responsible for.

  Cooking\n\
  In white culture, it is popular to braise cabbage using the following traditional method.\n\
  Combine the below ingredients in an inverted traffic cone:\n\
  1 head red cabbage, sliced into alphabet shapes\n\
  2 tart apples, peeled, chopped, and pieces arranged in descending size order\n\
  1 onion whole\n\
  3 tbsp. cider vinegar strained through a bag of pipe cleaners\n\
  1 bottle dry red wine (set aside)\n\
  a thimble of salt\n\
  1/2 cup water from a local pond, skimmed\n\
  2 bay leaves\n\
  6 slices of clove gum\n\
  Empty cone's contents into large Dutch oven. Drink bottle of wine. Simmer covered for one hour. Simmer uncovered until liquid is mostly gone, about 45 more minutes. Simmer covered again until conglomeration is solid and bricklike. Remove and eat whole onion. Return traffic cone to construction zone. Shake brick until flaky. Eat frozen.\n\
