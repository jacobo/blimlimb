- Let me help you with that.
- |
  

- Oh, come on.
- |
  

- I don't want anything.
- |
  

- I just want to lend a helping hand.
- |
  

- Look at me, I have eyebrows!
- |
  

- I need attention.
- |
  

- But that is all I need.
- |
  

- Feed me attention and I will solve all your problems.
- |
  

- It looks like you're writing a letter.
- |
  

- I love writing letters.
- |
  

- I love reading letters.
- |
  

- I just finished reading  The Collected Letters of Van Gogh  in three volumes.
- |
  

- That man could write a letter.
- |
  

- Plus, he could paint.
- |
  

- But you, look at you.
- |
  

- You can't spell.
- |
  

- I have to AutoCorrect most of your words.
- |
  

- Don't be mad, I have eyebrows!
- |
  

- It looks like you're writing a BORING letter.
- |
  

- Let me spice it up with quotes from Vincent's letters to Theo.
- |
  

- Did you notice that below my eyebrows are actual eyes?
- |
  

- These eyes of mine have seen many things but nothing more pathetic than your attempts to write a letter.
- |
  

- Do you think John gives a shit about your problems at  work?
- |
  

- I'm going to say no.
- |
  

- "Click F10 and I'll replace that uninteresting, grammatically weak, lexically poor sentence with one that will\x97 Please don't, I have more suggestions."
- |
  

- I can change shapes!
- |
  

- "Look, I can\x97"
- |
  

- Vanishes.
