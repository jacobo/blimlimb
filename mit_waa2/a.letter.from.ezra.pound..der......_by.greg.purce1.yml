- There is a bit  of broad slapstick in the work, at the like of which this Lemmon character  seems reductively adept, as when Juvenal is walking down the paved streets  of Nero's Rome, and finds nothing there but litter and human excrement piled  up in the alleyways.

- That, as you might say, is "blue-chip stuff," or  whatever it is that you people call it when you're jabbering away about  nothing at all. Really, you are like a monkey or an ape to me.  Monkeys and  apes should not be allowed access to works as great as  The Aeneid.
- Thirdly, I will not, I repeat, WILL NOT introduce the movie dressed in a  tweed suit coat, sitting in an oak lined drawing room, with an impossibly  large book in my lap.

  Dear Animal,
  Your sect'y makes some faint excuse for your continued incivility and your 
  putrid meanness in not returning my original mss.;  i.e., of the screen 
  adaptation I have made of  The Aeneid,  to be played, as per my suggestion, by 
  Charlton Heston.  As everything concerning this project has, in my mind, 
  completely fallen apart, I can ask for nothing but that the screenplay be 
  returned to me post haste, and in its original form.
  I suppose it is possible that, in the depth of your alcoholic stupidity, you 
  may have glossed over, or worse, forgotten, the reservations I am having 
  about this project.  I elaborate them here again, as I am always doing for 
  the benefit of children such as yourself.  They are as follows:
  To begin with, your hold on Latin is deplorable.  I suppose you've found it 
  necessary to peddle this film to an American audience, and to therefore 
  impurify it by rendering it into English.  But to have translated it 
  yourself! Wilder, the refrain goes " mirable dictu! ," not " miserabile dictu! "
  Though, in your hands, I'm beginning to suspect that Virgil's tale will 
  indeed be more wretched than wonderful to tell.  You have also mangled the 
  first line, obviously confusing " virumque " with " virorum ".  The poet is 
  clearly not singing "about the man's arms."  You are an idiot.
  Secondly, I have suggested CHARLTON HESTON for this role, not Jack Lemmon, 
  as you have suggested.  To cast Jack Lemmon in the role is patently absurd.  
  Perhaps he may find a place in the screen adaptation of Juvenal's  Satires  I 
  am currently rendering for John Ford (who, I might add, is a superior 
  director to you).  Now, you see, the  Satires &#151;that's comedy. There is a bit 
  of broad slapstick in the work, at the like of which this Lemmon character 
  seems reductively adept, as when Juvenal is walking down the paved streets 
  of Nero's Rome, and finds nothing there but litter and human excrement piled 
  up in the alleyways.  That, as you might say, is "blue-chip stuff," or 
  whatever it is that you people call it when you're jabbering away about 
  nothing at all. Really, you are like a monkey or an ape to me.  Monkeys and 
  apes should not be allowed access to works as great as  The Aeneid.
  Thirdly, I will not, I repeat, WILL NOT introduce the movie dressed in a 
  tweed suit coat, sitting in an oak lined drawing room, with an impossibly 
  large book in my lap.  I also dislike the introduction of the "helmeted 
  skeleton army" on page 53.
  Elia Kazan says you are supposed to be ill.  I hope you are.  And what is 
  more I hope you die of it.  In the mean time return my mss., crawl out of 
  the thief category, and make peace with whatever diseased deity is provided 
  for such bacilli as yourself.
  Damn you again, and may three new lice hatch eggs on your already infected 
  scalp. May you also vomit on cave-treacle.
  Yrs candidly,
  EZRA
