- Dear President Obama,
- I know you want to save the earth, but people don't want to  clean.
- |
  

- My life is to clean up all the world and help you to  clean.
- |
  

- I always dream of cleaning the world with you.
- |
  

- I'll do  anything for you because you are the president in this world.
- Stephanie Gonzalez, age 7

- Dear Obama family,
- When you move into the White House, turn on the heater so  it won't be cold.
- |
  

- You could also take hot baths in your new  antique bathtubs.
- |
  

- Or you could make hot tea and coffee.
- |
  

- When I moved to a new house, I helped my dad.
- |
  

- He took  apart a chair and I carried pieces of it.
- |
  

- If I were your helper  when you move in, I could move everything!
- |
  

- Have a nice day being the &#64257;rst family.
- Nazrawit Dessie, age 7
- Seattle
- Dear President Obama,
- If I want anybody to be president, it's me.
- |
  

- I would clean the  streets and give myself more money.
- |
  

- I would also give  everybody a piece of a Reese's candy.
- |
  

- Every homeless guy or  girl would get $50 for help and a place to sleep for the  winter.
- |
  

- My family and other families would get free gas for our  cars; single people with no kids would have to pay.
- |
  

- The money would come from copying other bills.
- |
  

- The $1, $2,  $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills would be copied one  thousand times.
- The paper would not come from trees but from hardened glue.
- |
  

- The way to make it is by mixing water and glue together so  that it looks like paper.
- |
  

- You then put it in a &#64257;re, then let it  cool in the freezer.

  Dear President Obama,\n\
  I know you want to save the earth, but people don't want to \n\
  clean. My life is to clean up all the world and help you to \n\
  clean. I always dream of cleaning the world with you. I'll do \n\
  anything for you because you are the president in this world.\n\

  Dear Obama family,\n\
  When you move into the White House, turn on the heater so \n\
  it won't be cold. You could also take hot baths in your new \n\
  antique bathtubs. Or you could make hot tea and coffee. \n\
  When I moved to a new house, I helped my dad. He took \n\
  apart a chair and I carried pieces of it. If I were your helper \n\
  when you move in, I could move everything! \n\
  Have a nice day being the &#64257;rst family.\n\
