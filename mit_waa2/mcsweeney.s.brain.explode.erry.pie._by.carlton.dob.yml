- Dear Carlton,
- My fianc&eacute; Billy was shipped off to the Persian Gulf eight months ago.
- |
  

- During the war in Iraq, he wrote when he could, but my primary source of information concerning his whereabouts came from CNN and, specifically, the daily press briefings by Brigadier General Vincent Brooks.
- |
  

- Handsome and confident, the assured manner in which General Brooks related the events of each day made me proud of my country and proud of my man.
- |
  

- Knowing that soldiers like General Brooks were in command of the troops allowed me to sleep soundly each night, looking forward to the day when Billy would come home and cast his eyes on our baby son for the very first time.
- |
  

- With the "major hostilities" over, it seems as though they've mothballed General Brooks, and well&#8230; I miss him. Not as much as I miss Billy, but still.
- So please, Carlton, could you write a song parody about Brigadier General Vincent Brooks, sung to the tune of Warrant's "Cherry Pie"?
- Sincerely,
- Lisa S.
