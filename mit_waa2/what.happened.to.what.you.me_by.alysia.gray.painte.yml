- The FLU (2003) I immediately came down with kept me on the couch for a week in a puddle of shivers and sweats.

- So were you going to call me or what?
- "Aunt Luisa:  The GINGERBREAD-MAN BROOCH (2002) that plays a tune when the \"Press Here\" button is pressed, much like the gingerbread-man brooch you're fond of wearing, stayed in the box through February. I felt conflicted about the gift, knowing I'd never wear it, but I was touched that you see yourself in me, and in me your love of seasonal jewelry that can be listened to. Ultimately, I put the brooch on for 10 minutes (so I could tell you that I wore it), took it off, and gave it to Mrs. Johnson in 7B, who wears it pretty much year-round. Not a regift in the traditional sense; Mrs. Johnson understands that you gave it to me, and asks me every day if you're coming by, so she can be sure to unpin the brooch, hide it, and never accidentally mention it or any brooch-related topic in your presence."

- I tried to donate it to the library book sale, but the volunteer wordlessly handed it back to me, her thumb hiding the cover illustration.
