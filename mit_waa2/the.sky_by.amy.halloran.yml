  One day the sky was an extraordinary shade of blue.  It was a blue
  the likes of which no one had ever seen, not even in their dreams.  It
  was a blue that crossed all boundaries, that summoned up sailors and
  oceans and nights from all seasons.  It was a blue that reminded people
  of wishes, the small hopes they tried to forget while walking about
  their daily routines.
  The color shocked all who saw it, especially the most jaded New
  Yorkers.  The sky made people stop in their tracks in the middle of the
  day and consider quarrels, why they ever had them.  People first seeing
  the sky quit driving.  They put their feet on the brakes when lights
  were green, left their keys in their cars and walked into traffic.  No
  one was killed because the color called them to witness simultaneously.
  Radios played dead air as DJs left their stations to see the
  special thing.  News crews were dispatched on the spot.  Normally
  talkative reporters held their breath.  The sky was too delicious.  The
  sky made them delirious.  They waved their hands in helplessness and
  stuttered into mumbles.  No, they said, there was nothing they could
  say.
  Children were the least stunned, having less of a wealth of
  comparisons.  They were disappointed by the adults they consulted for
  explanations.  They were not accustomed to seeing the community they one day
  planned to join stumbling, gasping at the sky.
  "What is it, Mommy? Teacher?" they wanted to know.  The voices of
  small children were all that could be heard as everyone tried to make
  sense of the normal going askew.
  The religious were inclined to think of apocalypse.  They ran to
  their churches, where even the pastors could not finger disaster or
  glory.  It was, after all, simple, a glimpse of sky.  The ordinary
  background turned its back on its believers and encouraged doubt,
  incredulity.
  The politicians tried to take advantage of the opportunity, but
  even they, at their podiums full of microphones, found it daunting.
  "The sky is blue," they said in frightened, thunderous tones, as if
  this were news.
  People went home, walking long miles with beneficent smiles on
  their faces.  They opened their curtains and windows.  They took vinegar
  and newspapers and started to clean.  The color flooded in like a bath,
  filling rooms like loud visitors.  It made people feel warm and naked,
  and so they took off their clothes, to feel like they felt.
  At six o'clock, one anchorman per town broadcast his mute assessment.
  Nobody over the age of ten cared what the newscaster thought should be
  done about the sky, or what had caused it.  This shade of blue erased all
  questions for adults.  The nagging agony of experience was stilled.  As
