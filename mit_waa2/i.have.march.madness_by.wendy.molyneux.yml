- Day One
- Not too many surprises today.
- |
  

- The Alabama upset hurt me, as I had them staying in until the third round.
- |
  

- Still, am somewhere in the middle of brother-in-law's tourney pool.
- |
  

- Kansas doesn't play until tomorrow so am not emotionally invested yet.
- |
  

- Had weird dream about government implanting chip in my brain when I dozed off during the Creighton game.
- |
  

- Also, is it possible my cat is talking to me?
- Day Two, Morning
- NC State has a five-point lead over Charlotte as I write.
- |
  

- Am afraid if Charlotte pulls it out, my whole Syracuse bracket will fall apart.
- |
  

- My parents and brother-in-law are currently beating me handily in tourney pool.
- |
  

- Cat definitely looking at me strangely.
- |
  

- Is it possible cat is working for government?
- Day Two, Evening
- Kansas about to tip off.
- |
  

- Cat told me earlier that they are going to go all the way.
- |
  

- Also told me that I have to wear the same outfit until tournament is over.
- |
  

- Am not sure whether to listen to cat or CIA agent talking inside my brain, who insists Illinois will take it all.
- |
  

- Regardless, have got to hide the family of lions that appeared in my stairwell after work, especially because one of them looks a lot like Brad Pitt, and the last thing I need this weekend is a bunch of tabloid photographers hanging around while I'm trying to watch the games.
- |
  

- The Brad Pitt lion said he'd like to discuss his theories about the JFK assassination with me later.
- |
  

- I told him he has to wait until after KU game.
- |
  

- Here comes the tip-off.
- |
  

- Rock Chalk.
- Day Three
- Covered all windows in tinfoil as instructed by Michigan State Spartans center Paul Davis when he oozed out of the TV into my living room last night.
- |
  

- Cat is jealous that Brad Pitt lion allowed to claw sofa, but find it hard to yell at handsome lion.
- |
  

- Lions are rabid Arizona fans, but the cat is charmed by the underdog success of UAB and would like to see them keep rolling.
- |
  

- "This just in: JFK is alive."
- |
  

- Has been living with Biggie Smalls and Mira Sorvino in a condo in Houston, but is coming back this afternoon and will need a place to stay.
- |
  

- Am making nachos.
- |
  

- Hope JFK likes nachos.
- Day Six
- Woke up to find Dick Cheney going through my chest of drawers with Coach K. Brad Pitt lion killed and ate them.
- |
  

- Will this affect Duke's chances?
- |
  

- Or is Redick just unstoppable?
- |
  

- "Cannot think about now, must make jalape\xF1o poppers for JFK, who has become, frankly, a fatty."
- |
  

- Says he has a slow metabolism but I think maybe smoked too much pot with Biggie and became lazy.
- |
  

- Paul Davis needs to ooze back into TV, but satellite dish not working since the CIA cut power to my apartment.
- |
  

- Said was necessary so that foreign governments would not suspect I am hiding JFK in guest room.
- |
  

- Am not concerned about missing upcoming games since they are being broadcast directly into my mind.
- |
  

- Am concerned about my brother-in-law leading in pool.
- Day Eight
- How is my mom doing so well in pool?
- |
  

- She does not even like basketball.
- |
  

- Also, do lions like sandwiches?
- Day 10
- Have not been to work since last Friday, but am working full-time for government interviewing my cat about the cast of  Happy Days , all of whom live in cat's belly.
- Day 14
- Realize I am actually in NCAA tournament.
- |
  

- Change my tourney picks so that I beat Illinois in finals.
- |
  

- Is it true that the Illinois players are all time-traveling rabbits?
- |
  

- Regardless, will  not  let on that I know.
- Day 19
- Final game between my team (have put JFK, cat, lions, and Paul Davis on the squad) and the Illinois Time-Traveling Rabbits to be played tonight in my hall closet.
- |
  

- JFK, despite his girth, worked the three consistently to beat Wake Forest, and I hope he can do it again if he isn't too high.
- |
  

- Cat can't be counted on in the paint but good with strategy.
- |
  

- Brad Pitt lion strong on defense.
- |
  

- "Am hoping giant talking jalape\xF1o popper can contain Dee Brown, but no matter what happens tonight I know my ragtag team of underdogs will be proud of just how far we've come."
- |
  

- No team of time-traveling bunnies can take that away from us.
- |
  

- Or can they?
- |
  

- No. Yes.
- |
  

- No. I'm a cupcake!
- |
  

- A pretty, pretty cupcake!
- Day 20
- No memory of last 20 days.
- |
  

- "Someone has scratched \"I heart Brad Pitt lion\" into living-room wall. Lost tourney pool, job, 25 pounds, and boyfriend. All windows blacked out. I smell and I am covered in frosting. Am pretty sure this eviction notice is for me. In the midst of the burned-out landscape that used to be my life, I am left with one big question: What will KU do next year without Langford? Rock Chalk."
