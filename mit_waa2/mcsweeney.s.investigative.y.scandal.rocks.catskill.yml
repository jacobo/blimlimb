  "I've been around the world 50 times, and let me tell you, I know when
  I'm in a good hotel -- like when the towels are so fluffy, you can
  barely get your suitcase closed..." -- Joey Adams, "Strictly For Laughs"
  column, page 49,  New York Post , Monday, February 22, 1999.
  "What a hotel: the towels were so big and fluffy you could hardly close
  your suitcase." -- Henny Youngman, 500 All-Time Greatest One-Liners,
  Pinnacle Books, 1981.
  "[Referring to Trump's new International Hotel on Columbus Circle] It's
  so swanky, room service has an unlisted number..." Adams, IBID.
  "A very exclusive hotel. Room service has an unlisted number." Youngman,
  page102.
  Here's one hot item you won't find on Page Six (which, we hear, isn't
  even always on Page Six, by the way): Joey Adams, veteran New York Post
  columnist, is a serial (congenital?) plagiarist. Adams, who bears no
  relation to the shrill-voiced "Chasing Amy" actress who shares his name
  but is married to E! Gossip Show yenta/syndicated columnist Cindy Adams,
  has been caught stealing from his late colleague Henny Youngman's
  routine less than a year after the dead, and thus defenseless, Youngman
  passed on to the Catskills in the sky at the age of 91.
  Evidence uncovered by the McSweeney's investigative sting reveals that
  Adams has been grave-robbing for material, exhuming famous lines or
  "bits" of the late comedian Youngman and presenting the material in his
  daily "Strictly For Laughs" column without attribution.
  Though the Rupert Murdoch-owned  Post  was quick to condemn disgraced
  journalist Mike Barnicle in a similar scandal (its sister paper,  The
  Boston Herald , even broke the story of then- Boston Globe  columnist
  Barnicle cribbing lines from comedian George Carlin's best-seller
  Braindroppings), the tabloid has been oddly quiet about Henny-gate,
  leading critics (us) to charge that there is a conspiracy of cronyism in
  the gossip community. The comedic community, notoriously possessive of
  individual comic's rights to "material" was unavailable for comment, as
  funnyman David Brenner was touring, or something. The hip-hop community,
  however, was available for comment. "He [Adams] bit another MC
  [Youngman]," said rapper DMX , "Now he gots ta get shook."
  This probably isn't the first time that Adams has pilfered punchlines.
  Charges that Adams also used Youngman's line "My wife got plastic
  surgery -- I cut up her credit cards!" are also pending. Fortunately,
  Youngman's wife, Sadie, died in 1987 at the age of 82, so there's no
  chance of Joey "taking" her as well (it was, after all, only a joke).
