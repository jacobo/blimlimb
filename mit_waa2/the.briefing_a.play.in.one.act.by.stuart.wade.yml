- A PLAY IN ONE ACT.
- |
  

- BY STUART WADE
- |
  

- "Setting: small conference room of a large business hotel."
- |
  

- Several dozen REPORTERS are crowded into the cramped space.
- |
  

- At the rear of the media horde, about a dozen television cameras stand on tripods, with TV lights shining across to illuminate the single SPOKESPERSON who stands behind a microphone-strewn lectern to address the group.
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- We all know that there's a specific piece of information in question here.
- |
  

- And with regard to it, let me first state that I know you all would like for me to say what we all think I'm coming before you to say.
- |
  

- I would like to make it very clear, however, that I do not intend to say it.
- |
  

- In addition, I will neither confirm nor deny it.
- |
  

- So now that we all understand each other, are there any questions?
- |
  

- REPORTER 1
- Will you say what we want you to say?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- Not exactly as you would have me say it.
- |
  

- REPORTER 2]  Yes -- over there?
- |
  

- REPORTER 2
- Is the thing we all want you to say, in fact, true?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- I'm not saying if it is or it isn't.
- |
  

- It would be premature to judge that.
- |
  

- REPORTER 3
- Since you're not saying the precise thing we all want you to say, will you say it, but in a slightly different way?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- You mean in a way that would have the same meaning as the way you would all want me to say it?
- |
  

- REPORTER 3
- That is correct.
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- I'm not prepared at this time to do that.
- |
  

- REPORTER 4]  Yes?
- |
  

- REPORTER 4
- If you won't say what we all would like you to say, or if you won't say it in a  slightly different  way, will you at least say one or a couple of  parts   of what we all want you to say?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- If there is a situation where that would become prudent for me to say part or parts of what you all want me to say, I would, yes.
- |
  

- But now is not the time.
- |
  

- REPORTER 5
- When will it be time?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- I don't know the answer to that.
- |
  

- I wanted to add something at this point, before we continue.
- |
  

- There are some people involved behind the scenes with this thing who deserve to be recognized for all their hard work.
- |
  

- This thing has been a team effort all the way, and thanks to them, a real win-win situation as well.
- |
  

- REPORTER 6]  Yes, go ahead.
- |
  

- REPORTER 6
- This information that we all want you to disclose -- might one of us be able to trick you into divulging what we all want you to say?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- If I am slow-witted at that moment, or if I'm not being too careful in choosing my words right then,  and  if one of you people displays extremely shrewd questioning skills, then yes, it is possible.
- |
  

- Yes -- all the way in the back there.
- |
  

- Miss.
- |
  

- REPORTER 7
- I think I know the information we all want you to say but that you aren't saying, and here it is [she says something inaudible].
- |
  

- Isn't that right?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- |
  

- Do you expect me to answer that?
- |
  

- Next question.
- |
  

- REPORTER 8
- When can we expect you to say what we all want you to say?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- Relatively soon.
- |
  

- REPORTER 8
- Can you be more specific?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- Well, we are expediting this process so I would imagine sooner than you might think, but I don't want to mislead any of you as to exactly when.
- |
  

- Yes, Helen?
- |
  

- REPORTER 9
- I heard some experts giving their opinions about the information we all want you to say.
- |
  

- Can you respond to these expert comments?
- |
  

- SPOKESPERSON
- Well, I can't speculate on others' comments.
- |
  

- And, I'm not an expert.
- |
  

- I have time for one more question.
- |
  

- In the middle there, yes -- you sir?
- |
  

- REPORTER 10
- Might I interject a witty comment at this juncture to break up the tension?
- |
  

- Curtain.

  REPORTER 7
  I think I know the information we all want you to say but that you aren't saying, and here it is [she says something inaudible].  Isn't that right?

  &nbsp;
  SPOKESPERSON
  Well, I can't speculate on others' comments.  And, I'm not an expert.  [looks up to assembled throng]  I have time for one more question.  In the middle there, yes -- you sir?  [points to bearded man standing in center of group].
  &nbsp;
  REPORTER 10
  Might I interject a witty comment at this juncture to break up the tension?  [says something inaudible]
  &nbsp;
  [everyone laughs]
