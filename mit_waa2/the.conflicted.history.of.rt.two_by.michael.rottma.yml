- In my 18 years here at Sport and Gaming, nothing has caused more infighting and heartache.
- |
  

- Nothing.
- |
  

- The sheer number of claims to the Wave .
- |
  

- It's been my personal goal, tracking the Wave .
- |
  

- I've been working on a book.
- |
  

- "I'm trying to incorporate that \"whale\" metaphor into the title.  The White Wave  maybe, except there's a surfing collective that holds the copyri\x97"
- Oh, that?
- |
  

- A Neanderthal.
- |
  

- This is a statue of Gabak, inventor of the formless yell.
- |
  

- You know, "Aaahhh," or "Waauuughh.
- "\" We can't be a hundred percent certain of what he looked like, and the PR department chose those clothes."
- |
  

- Pshh.
- |
  

- A loin cloth.
- |
  

- Anything to get tourists in here.
- Anyway, I won't bore you with a lot of details.
- |
  

- In a nutshell, modern claims are all bunk.
- |
  

- We'd tracked the Wave to the Normans in the English conquest, but then we found a tapestry dating back to Pepin the Short's reign.
- |
  

- He's pictured on the tapestry, straining to do the Wave himself.
- |
  

- Hilarious.
- |
  

- I'm sorry I can't show you.
- |
  

- It's quite fragile.
- Then it turned out that the Franks had read about the Wave in a lesser-known tract by Pliny the Younger.
- |
  

- "\"Oh hell,\""
- |
  

- "\"now we're into classical times."
- "\" We think they did the Wave naked, but our facts are spotty."
- |
  

- And before that .
- |
  

- We can only guess.

- I don't talk about it much.
- |
  

- Don't have much cause.
- |
  

- Lord, it was .
- |
  

- This was close to 50 years ago.
- |
  

- Had a lot of jobs since.
- |
  

- A lot of things I don't remember from back then.
- |
  

- "And I'm not saying that because of the hush money\x97hell, what are they gonna do to an old man?"
- |
  

- But then, some things just .
- |
  

- Pour me a bit more of that good stuff, will you?
- Worked lots of places worse than Dow Chemical.
- |
  

- Lots.
- |
  

- Decent bunch, but humorless.
- |
  

- Paranoid.
- |
  

- Always wondering who was watching them.
- |
  

- If we had a notice not to clean this or that room, we took it seriously.
- |
  

- But I took my work seriously, and when Eddie lit out that night .
- |
  

- Always cutting corners, Eddie.
- |
  

- Never marked on the checklist where he'd mopped.
- |
  

- So it was up to me to check lab 4, neurotoxin wing.
- I should have left when I saw the green glow, but .
- |
  

- I opened her up just to take a gander at the floor.
- |
  

- It was gonna be in and out.
- |
  

- But the mice .
- |
  

- Well, I've seen lots of dead things.
- |
  

- You clean nooks and crannies long enough, you get used to it.
- |
  

- Rats, bugs, the odd bat.
- |
  

- That's how I knew these mice weren't dead.
- |
  

- They were lined up in rows in this huge, flat glass box.
- |
  

- Just sitting.
- |
  

- And that machine in front of them, I think they call it an oscilloscope?
- |
  

- That murky green wave moving across the screen.
- |
  

- And .
- |
  

- I can't rightly explain what changed in me, seeing those mice.
- |
  

- Standing on their hind legs with the movement of that green line.
- |
  

- Like they were on a rope.
- |
  

- Over and over again, with precision.
- |
  

- Precision.
- |
  

- They moved as one.
- |
  

- Like they'd become that electronic wave.
- Jumped a mile when a tech walked in and asked what I was doing there.
- |
  

- Then he recognized me and got this shifty look on his face.
- |
  

- Said the lab was off limits for cleaning that night.
- |
  

- I have no idea what I said to get out of there.
- |
  

- No idea.
- Next day it started.
- |
  

- Long stares.
- |
  

- Cold front from the engineers.
- |
  

- When they finally called me in for a chat, I was set to turn in my coveralls.
- |
  

- But they were all charm, these management guys, which creeped me out worse.
- |
  

- They said some stuff about loose lips.
- |
  

- I knew the score.
- Not long after, people started doing it.
- That's the day I quit going to games.
- |
  

- Baseball, football.
- |
  

- I couldn't even stand to be near my kids' soccer games for fear of people lifting themselves, like those squirming gray mice with their beady eyes fixed on the green line.
- |
  

- Empty eyes.
- |
  

- That's what I see.
- |
  

- The empty eyes reflecting that bad light.
- Poseidon
- Hear me and tremble, ye who would seek an audience with the Lord of the Seas!
- |
  

- He who makes the whales bellow and the eels electrify has come to settle yet another affair of man.
- |
  

- As in my wrath I set Odysseus adrift, so in my mercy do I set you, the land-dwelling mortals, on the correct course.
- Truly, mankind has nothing better than this?
- |
  

- No naval wars, no .
- |
  

- So be it.
- |
  

- I shall begin.
- I do not claim parentage of your so-called Wave.
- |
  

- Do you think the Master of the Fishes would insult the tides with such a foolish namesake?
- |
  

- No. Though the waves of the sea spring from my very will, the Wave springs from man's limited abilities.
- Ha ha ha!
- |
  

- Do not cower in shame!
- |
  

- I mean no insult.
- |
  

- Though your Wave be a crude thing, it was created in humility, with reverence.
- Have you not heard of the mortal Trachomenes?
- |
  

- Pah.
- |
  

- Your culture has sunk lower than the Marianas Trench.
- |
  

- For Trachomenes was a great dramatist, revered in his time, forgotten by rash humanity.
- |
  

- His son enjoyed frolicking in my realm, splashing and swimming and laughing.
- |
  

- He did not grimace at the slimy kelp, as so many of you do.
- |
  

- One day, though, the son of Trachomenes unknowingly pissed in the face of a Nereid, who grew angry and tossed the child to the deep waters where my undertow is to be feared.
- |
  

- He struggled and cried out, and his cries reached me.
- |
  

- I admit, the young ones swell my briny heart, and I was moved to save him.
- What?
- |
  

- Who interrupts the anecdote of Poseidon?
- |
  

- No, brainless one, I did not "tow him to shore.
- "\" What kind of rescue is that?"
- |
  

- Hang your head and be silent!
- |
  

- With my Olympian skill for mythmaking, I disguised myself as a giant clam to swallow the boy, so his puny lungs would be safe.
- |
  

- He called out, "
- Lo, I am saved from one death, but condemned to another!
- |
  

- How shall I breathe in this space?
- "\" I bade Zephyrus the West Wind blow air inside me so the boy might breathe."
- |
  

- A peculiar sensation, that.
- "Then I made my great journey\x97slowly, as a clam lacks swiftness."
- |
  

- One day, a pearl seeker on the Ionian shore found me and opened me, expecting to make his fortune.
- |
  

- Instead, the boy leapt out!
- |
  

- Nearby, Trachomenes was mourning with his family when his teary eyes beheld his son running toward him.
- |
  

- After the boy told his tale, Trachomenes lay prostrate and said, "This is an act of the great and benevolent Poseidon!
- "\" But how best to thank the Ruler of the Reefs?"
- Trachomenes was so grateful that he created a theatrical metaphor honoring the mighty waves that had borne his son home.
- |
  

- The mortals stood and sat, one by one, row by row.
- |
  

- How beautifully they rolled through the theatron!
- |
  

- I was pleased.
- |
  

- Greatly pleased indeed.
- And so you have been enlightened by the fell Poseidon.
- |
  

- Use your knowledge justly, minions, and hail Trachomenes, bringer of the Wave.
- |
