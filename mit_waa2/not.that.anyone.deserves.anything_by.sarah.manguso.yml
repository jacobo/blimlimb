- In a dream she goes to France because he is there, but when she gets there she realizes she has traveled to the wrong France.

- He calls her, unable to say anything, and so instead gives real-time descriptions of what his cats are doing.
- |
  

- On the last day of summer camp, Backwards Day, they say, "This is the first dance," and she thinks, "What a relief &#151; I have another hour to worry about being asked to dance.
- "\" It's a few minutes later before she realizes that, in fact, it's the last dance, and she is out of chances."

- People drink and then sing and then he returns home to find that she, true to her word, has gone.
- |
  

- He throws the letter into the trash, hoping she will find it.
- |
  

- Later he pretends to sleep through the sounds of someone else coming home and throwing up and falling down.
- |
  

- He does not kiss her goodbye and so her mouth catches on his jaw stubble and runs down his neck, leaving a sluggy trail.
- |
  

- She walks her computer through the airport x-ray.
- |
  

- He looks for something of his, and finds her passport and her condoms and the little stuffed lion that used to belong to the cat.
- |
  

- He finds her journals from years and years ago, but the letter he wrote her is not there.
- |
  

- She gives her therapist a plant with little yellow flowers.
- |
  

- He wants to drive down to the Smoky Mountains or, if he gets a hankering for sun, the beaches of North Carolina.
- |
  

- "\"Not that anyone deserves anything in this world,\""
- |
  

- "\"But still I, like the rest of us, feel that I do."
- |
  

- The doctor finds a lemon-sized tumor in what he calls a cul-de-sac.
- |
  

- "\"Well, I'm dead,\""
- |
  

- Later, at work, when she calls to tell him, he asks her, "How big is a lemon?
- |
  

- He takes a few slugs of vodka straight from the plastic bottle, and she puts on Very Best of Elevator Music, Volume Three.
- |
  

- He has a giant snake tattoo on his left bicep.
- |
  

- He tells her he likes her because she's smart &#151; because she's great for conversation.
- |
  

- "A sculptor explains his idea: he will build a stealth kite, a kite the color of the sky."
