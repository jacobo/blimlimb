- We were stationed in an armored truck fitted with a gigantic, bulletproof, Hollywood-style floodlight mounted in back.
- |
  

- It moved like an anti-aircraft gun, by means of a bucket seat that swiveled, while the operator's feet moved in a kind of shuffle step, from side to side.
- |
  

- The great white beam pierced miles of bare wilderness.
- |
  

- While I sat behind the light, Sayla,  stretched flat on the ground on his belly and hugged close to one of the  truck's front tires, manned a Belgium Mag machine gun.
- |
  

- A third soldier,  Rami, the driver, hid in "ambush" in the ditch that ran near the foot of the  border fence. He was our crossfire.
- This, then, was "G-Beat.
- Of course, the Egyptians shot at us.
- |
  

- Yes, we had a peace treaty but every  night there were so-called "infractions.
- "\" Violations of a large or small  nature, even if just short of total war, were still and always just  \""
- |
  

- "\" Because of the treaty, nothing short of peace was admissible."
- |
  

- Every bullet fired by Egypt, every mortar round, RPG , grenade rocket, was  peacefully launched and dutifully recorded by us and processed by our  intelligence.
- |
  

- Then, on the morning after, an Israeli liason officer armed  with a complete and detailed log of the night's infractions crossed the  border at Rafiah and handed the data over to a waiting Egyptian intelligence  officer, who passed it up his chain of command.
- |
  

- Certain actions were then  taken against the offenders.
- |
  

- "So, say that the three hungry, unsheltered Egyptian  soldiers just over the fence from us and outfitted with little more than  Kalatchnikovs &#8212; assault rifles with eight  clips of twenty nine rounds each, plus all sorts of portable anti-tank and  anti-personnel ordinance &#8212; began their shift in typical fashion: building  a fire not only to ward off jackals, whose hump-backed shapes lurk at the  edge of their encampment, but also in a pathetic effort to warm up against the frigid desert night, a cold  so raw it froze your canteen to your lips."
- They hugged themselves in those tattered brown fieldcoats with  flapping Chaplinesque sleeves.
- |
  

- Their faces, lit by flames, looked devilishly  peeved.
- |
  

- They hopped from foot to foot in unlaced boots with soles bound together  by tape.
- |
  

- Bored, they sang Egyptian rock tunes.
- |
  

- Heaving a big sigh for the  trouble I was about to cause, I flipped on the searchlight's toggle switch; the  generator humming to life.
- |
  

- Sayla tore the canvas  coverlet away.
- |
  

- He laid down again, his squinting eye sighting his weapon.
- "\"Okay,\""
- |
  

- I hit ON.
- |
  

- An immense tubular beam shot like a muzzle  flash from a tank round, deep into their territory, probing.
- Moving my boots along the round metal grid underfoot, I swept the beam  from left to right, and back again, illuminating trees and bushes frozen in  fearsome silhouettes suggestive of everything from Arab djin spirits to  Goya's countrymen impaled by Napoleon's dragoons.
- |
  

- The beam alerted every  Egyptian infantryman, aircraft, artillery battery, tank unit, wild beast and  poison insect for a hundred miles to the fact of my existence.
- And what is the purpose of this?
- I asked myself that question as my boots did their seated desert  dance.
- I had no answer.
- |
  

- I did my senseless little suicidal tango with a mounting  sense of impending doom while Sayla, looking up, called out "Why are we doing  this?
- |
  

- "\" and shrieked with glee for the absence of a sensible reply, and  sighted his Mag again."
- |
  

- No one ever really explained to us the purpose of "G-Beat.
- We vaguely understood that we sought squads of terrorists traveling on  foot, or gold and hash smugglers, or Egyptians seeking a quick way to visit  their relations on the other side of the randomly drawn border slicing right  through the center of the city of Rafiah.
- |
  

- No Arab could cross to our side who  did not have a return ticket to fly home.
- |
  

- There was also  some sort of exit tax imposed by the Egyptians that most could not afford to  pay and, in addition, we Israelis had our own tax waiting for them once they  crossed over.
- Apparently, avoidance of this tax was well worth the risk of getting shot.
- At any rate, we never spotted a single intruder.
- |
  

- Not long into the night,  discipline on our side would quickly erode.
- |
  

- Rami, our ambushing crossfire man, stood up from his hiding place  and trudge up to the truck with a disgusted look on his face.
- |
  

- After hours  spent watching the Egyptian soldiers on the other side of the fence dance  around their pathetic fire to keep warm he declared "Fuck this shit!
- "\" and  reaching into a toolbox, removed a boom box, which he plugged into the truck's  portable generator."
- |
  

- Suddenly, "
- Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"  boomed through the night and the excited Egyptians broke into a kind of disco  warpath step around the flames, the Kalatchnikovs slung from their shoulder  swinging back and forth.
- |
  

- "Rami stood a few feet from the truck with a look of grim  satisfaction, clapping his hands and occasionally screaming out snippets of  the lyrics in poor English:  \"Is twenty years a dog to gay"
- Sergeant Pepper make he go away &#8230;!
- |
  

- Then they began shouting "Yacobi!
- |
  

- Yacobi!
- |
  

- Ochel!
- |
  

- Ochel!
- "\" Hebrew for  \""
- Jacob!
- |
  

- Jacob!
- |
  

- Food!
- |
  

- Food!
- "\" This posed another riddle that I could not  successfully answer: why they would use as euphemism for us Jews the name of  a biblical figure who wrestled with an angel and, laying his head on a rock  for a pillow, dreamed of seraphim climbing and descending ladders between  heaven and earth?"
- At this point we broke out our food supply, which was considerable.
- |
  

- Israeli soldiers eat well.
- |
  

- Chicken cutlets.
- |
  

- Mashed potatoes.
- |
  

- Salad.
- |
  

- Bread  with butter and jam.
- |
  

- Fruit.
- |
  

- We made a stack of jam sandwiches, put them in a  bread sack, and swinging it over our heads as David and his slingshot, tossed  it over the fence.
- With no thank you, they fell to it, sat cross-legged on the ground  and stuffed the sandwiches into their mouths; their cheeks puffed like  squirrels.
- |
  

- They ate so fast that like snakes they had to stay perfectly still  to swallow the big lumps I feared they'd choke on.
- |
  

- Then they jumped to their  feet and shouting "Beatles!
- |
  

- Sergeant Pepper!
- "\" danced for as long as Rami  cared to keep the music turned up."
- |
  

- At one point we were all gyrating in  place, Jew and Arab, with dreamy, moonlit expressions.
- |
  

- "\"G-Beat,\""
- |
  

- Sayla  softly, undulating next to me.
- |
  

- "\"Huh, cutey?"
- |
  

- How you explain this?
- "\" I didn't  know then."
- |
  

- I still don't know.
- |
  

- "There are things I don't quite know how to  communicate: how, for instance, as the music faded, the scale of desolation  that its absence unveiled revealed the pitted blue face of the watching moon,   like some forlorn desert God; the sense of deep loneliness we all felt I'm  sure, Israeli and Egyptian both, as the cold night drove into hiding most of  those things that make the desert day a hell, but at least a living one, the  flies, scavenger birds, soldier ants, scarab beetles, scorpions."
- |
  

- We were but  for ourselves utterly alone in a void.
- |
  

- It was like sleeping awake.
- |
  

- The  desert night, impossibly, frigidly pure, was a temporary form of living  death.
- |
  

- Nothing moved.
- |
  

- Only the scrub brush writhed like witches risen from  the dust and the leering demonic snouts of the jackals ringed the campfire of   the Egyptian soldiers, who pelted them with rocks.
