- A bowling ball sits in a cubicle.
- |
  

- His bowling-pin boss comes over, looks at his work, tears it up, and yells at him.
- |
  

- Having finished for the day, the bowling ball goes to the parking garage, only to find that two bowling pins are trying to break into his car.
- |
  

- They smash one of his taillights before running away.
- |
  

- The bowling ball gets pulled over on his way home by a bowling-pin cop.
- |
  

- The bowling ball says he was going the speed limit, but the bowling-pin cop says he didn't pull him over for speeding.
- |
  

- He pulled him over for having a taillight out.
- |
  

- The bowling-pin cop says that usually he just warns drivers with a taillight out, but since he doesn't like the bowling ball's attitude he's going to give him a ticket.
- |
  

- When the bowling ball finally gets home, he finds his bowling-pin wife having sex with one of his bowling-pin co-workers.
- |
  

- They're both dressed in leather.
- |
  

- The bowling-pin wife stops for a minute to tell her husband that she doesn't love him anymore.
- |
  

- Then she and the bowling-pin co-worker start back up again with the bowling ball still in the room.
- |
  

- The bowling ball's eyes fill with tears.
- |
  

- GUTTER BALL !
- |
  

- A lifeboat of bowling pins floats on the Arctic Ocean.
- |
  

- It's been three days since they lost their Navy ship and several comrades to the enemy bowling-ball captain.
- |
  

- Starving to death, they draw straws to see who will be eaten so that the rest may survive.
- |
  

- The short straw goes to a young private bowing pin.
- |
  

- His eyes filling with tears, he wonders why God has forsaken him, why he had to follow in his father's footsteps and join the Navy.
- |
  

- "He wishes he could have been his own man and done what he wanted to do: culinary school."
- |
  

- A sparkle in the distance interrupts his thoughts.
- |
  

- The bowling pins shout and light flares to get the approaching vessel's attention.
- |
  

- They realize their mistake too late.
- |
  

- The bowling-ball captain plows through the lifeboat with his battleship.
- |
  

- The bowling pins who are not drowned or torn apart by the ferocious engine freeze to death in under an hour.
- |
  

- SPARE !
- |
  

- A bowling-ball kid sits in a chair in an open room.
- |
  

- To his right, his bowling-pin mother.
- |
  

- To his left, his bowling-pin father.
- |
  

- They each look at him with pleading faces.
- |
  

- A bowling-pin lawyer hands the bowling-ball kid a clipboard with a piece of paper on it and then leaves the room.
- |
  

- "The paper reads: \"Who I want to have custody of me."
- |
  

- Check  only one  box.
- "\" There is a box for Mom and a box for Dad."
- |
  

- The bowling-ball kid looks at the paper for a long time.
- |
  

- He begins to sweat.
- |
  

- Then he has a panic attack.
- |
  

- SPLIT !
- |
  

- Two gangs of bowling pins are meeting in an abandoned warehouse.
- |
  

- One gang has a briefcase full of money and the other gang has a briefcase full of heroin.
- |
  

- They are about to make the trade when a maverick bowling-ball policeman crashes through one of the windows.
- |
  

- The bowling-pin gangs scatter, shooting AK-47s at the bowling-ball policeman, but, with a quick spray from his pistol, he kills all but one of the bowling pins.
- |
  

- The one he didn't kill escapes out the door.
- |
  

- The bowling ball chases him outside.
- |
  

- The warehouse turns out to be on top of a snowcapped mountain.
- |
  

- The bowling pin grabs a snowboard and starts down.
- |
  

- The bowling ball grabs his own snowboard and follows suit.
- |
  

- They exchange fire on their way down.
- |
  

- "The bowling ball is closing in on the bowling pin when suddenly: an avalanche!"
- |
  

- All is a haze.
- |
  

- The snow settles.
- |
  

- Everything is still for a moment.
- |
  

- Then the bowling ball and bowling pin rise from the snow and begin fistfighting.
- |
  

- The bowling pin knocks down the bowling ball, takes out a gun, and shoots the bowling ball in the chest.
- |
  

- The bowling pin begins to walk away, exhausted, when a gunshot rings out.
- |
  

- The pin falls to the ground dead.
- |
  

- The bowling ball sits up behind him holding a tiny revolver.
- |
  

- He takes off his shirt and his bulletproof vest and, examining the bruise, walks off into the sunset.
- |
  

- STRIKE !
