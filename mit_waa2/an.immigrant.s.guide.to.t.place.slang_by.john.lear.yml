- Greetings new American Person!

- America is not the full of no-smile no-fun guys like you see in the movies.
- |
  

- Also, they like to have good time.
- |
  

- They have many speech points with color, for you here we've guided, below.
- |
  

- Many of these parts will lift your ears with your new mates on the shift of your rewarding factory job.
- |
  

- If you can find one!
- |
  

- Ha-ha!
- "\"Shit rolls downhill."
- I lament the perceived inequalities of our capitalist system.
- "\"Payback's a bitch."
- Recompense may often seem unjust, but the world is a fair place.
- "\"Are you lookin' at me, Boat-boy?"
- Enough identity politics!
- "\"Life's a bitch and then you die."
- Death to bosses!
- "\"Life's a bitch and then you marry one."
- Death to bosses and bosses' wives!
- "\"I'm gonna open up a can of whoop-ass!"
- Pursuing this course may cause fisticuffs to follow (on your ass).
- "\"Money talks, bullshit walks."
- Our consumer commodity culture, though floating on a narrow raft in a sea of flim-flammery and hype, is not completely devoid of substance.
- "\"Work for the man, stick it to the man!"
- Honoring our elders can take many forms.
- "\"It's all good."
- I can respond in no other way but a meaningless platitude.
- "\"I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."
- Oh, life!
- |
  

- Sometimes the weight of existence is so great that I require non-prescription medication.
