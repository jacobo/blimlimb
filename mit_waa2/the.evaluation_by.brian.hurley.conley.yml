- The thirteen-year-old sits uncomfortably in the chair.
- |
  

- His fingers scratch at its plastic surface, and sweat runs down his back.
- |
  

- Behind the desk, facing him, sits a specialist to perform another evaluation.
- |
  

- The specialist clears his throat and removes a pen from his shirt pocket.
- |
  

- His thumb pauses above the pen's button as he looks up from the desk.
- |
  

- He smiles and clicks it into place.
- "Specialist: So let's begin."
- |
  

- Do you know why you're here?
- "Boy: Yes."
- "Specialist: The school district wants to give you a test."
- |
  

- You have a learning disability called &#151;
- "Boy: Dyslexia."
- "Specialist: Dyslexia &#151; Did you say something?"
- "Boy: Nothing."
- "Specialist: ."
- |
  

- Right.
- |
  

- Now, as I was saying, I'm going to show you some words and pictures and ask some questions.
- |
  

- You just &#151; take &#151; your &#151; time &#151; answering them.
- |
  

- Absolutely no pressure, okay?
- "Boy: Okay."
- The specialist pulls a spiral-bound card deck from a box and snaps it to the first card.
- |
  

- He folds the deck into a triangular support and places it on the desk.
- |
  

- As he flips from card to card the boy notices a pattern.
- |
  

- If a word is printed on the card the specialist pronounces it and asks for a definition.
- |
  

- If it's a picture he asks for a description.
- |
  

- "After forty-five minutes of questions the specialist reaches the last test card: a picture of the sun."
- "Specialist: Why is the sun hot?"
- Instantly the boy's brain is awash with visions of ionized hydrogen gas, fusing protons, and bursting plasma streams.
- |
  

- At the core of the sun, at temperatures exceeding twenty-six million degrees Fahrenheit, he knows, hydrogen nuclei are fused together and are converted to helium.
- |
  

- The boy can't spell these words, of course &#151; they always come out backwards anyway, ergo the latest evaluation, but he can see the concept in his mind.
- |
  

- Always thinking too many steps ahead, he can never say what he's thinking properly.
- |
  

- Succinctly.
- |
  

- Fluidly.
- |
  

- Like everybody else.
- |
  

- And there's never enough time to get the words right.
- "Boy: Fusion."
- The specialist looks up, stares at the boy and cocks his head like a puzzled dog.
- |
  

- Picking up the deck, he squints and silently reads the answer on the back of the card.
- "Specialist: That's not right."
- |
  

- Why is the sun hot?
- "Boy: Because of fusion."
- |
  

- Fusion &#151; fusing protons!
- "Specialist: I'll give you one more chance."
- |
  

- Look at the picture very, very carefully.
- |
  

- You see how the sun is a reddish yellow?
- |
  

- You see how it's glowing?
- |
  

- That means it's hot!
- "Boy: Yes."
- "Specialist: Good."
- |
  

- So, why is the sun hot?
- "Boy: Because of fusion."
- The specialist purses his lips and makes a slight sucking sound.
- |
  

- He flips the last card over.
- |
  

- It simply says, "End.
- "\" He takes a calculator and adds up the answers from the test."
- "Boy: How'd I do?"
- "Specialist: Well, according to this score you did pretty good."
- |
  

- You only missed one of the questions in the description section.
- "Boy: The sun question?"
- "Specialist: Yeah, that wasn't the answer we're looking for."
- "Boy: Well."
- |
  

- "Specialist: The sun is hot because it's on fire."
