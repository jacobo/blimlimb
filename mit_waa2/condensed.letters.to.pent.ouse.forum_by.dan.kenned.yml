- Dear  Penthouse ,
- I met a woman at a party recently and we ended up making love with such fervor that we knocked items off of the table near my bed.
- |
  

- And to think I had never considered the possibility of something like this even happening in the small town where I'm attending college!
- Name and Address Withheld
- |
  

- Dear  Penthouse ,
- Me again.
- |
  

- I'll make this quick, but last weekend at a car-wash fundraiser for the small liberal-arts college I'm attending, I ended up making love to one of the cute coeds working with me.
- |
  

- Arguably, as a result of her T-shirt getting wet during a playful water fight the two of us engaged in.
- |
  

- I am on fire this year!
- |
  

- Maybe it's the tan?
- More from me soon.
- |
  

- Dear  Penthouse ,
- Can't get into details for obvious reasons, but my roommate's girlfriend and I ended up making love.
- |
  

- I'm still kind of freaking out over the potential and obvious complications, but aside from feeling weird emotionally I have to say, things have changed for me.
- |
  

- It was never this way with girls.
- |
  

- Anyway, I certainly got more than I bargained for from a simple afternoon study session.
- Mr. K
- |
  

- Dear  Penthouse ,
- Oh.
- |
  

- My.
- |
  

- God.
- |
  

- I was back home recently for summer break and so was a girl I dated before heading off to college.
- |
  

- "All I can really tell you is this: She is bisexual now and I found myself in a situation that involved making love to her and&#8212;get this&#8212;also a beautiful mutual friend of ours  at the same time ."
- |
  

- All right, that's enough out of me, as the three of us are from a small enough town that it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to figure out who I'm talking about.
- I'm as stunned as you are, trust me.
