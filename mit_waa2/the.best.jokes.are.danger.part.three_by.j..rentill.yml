- Be sure to read  Part One  and  Part Two  of this interview.
- |
  

- "Q: You're known for your irreverence as a writer."
- |
  

- Is there anything you refuse to write about?
- "Kurt Vonnegut: Never try to write about your father."
- |
  

- Have you?
- "Q: No."
- "Vonnegut: Well, if you tried your brain would turn to concrete."
- "Q: You think?"
- "Vonnegut: Oh, yeah."
- |
  

- Men can't do it.
- |
  

- You learn about life by the accidents you have, over and over again, and your father is always in your head when that stuff happens.
- |
  

- Writing, most of the time, for most people, is an accident and your father is there for that, too.
- |
  

- You know, I taught writing for a while and whenever somebody would tell me they were going to write about their dad, I would tell them they might as well go write about killing puppies because neither story was going to work.
- |
  

- It just doesn't work.
- |
  

- Your father won't let it happen.
- |
  

- Laughs]
- "Q: I can hardly imagine writing about my own father."
- "Vonnegut: Oh, please don't."
- |
  

- We'll all be mad at you.
- "Q: In  Dr. Kevorkian , one of your interview subjects &#151; Dr. Staxx &#151; writes a poem: \"There are two types of men in this world/those who know they are weak/and those who think they are strong."
- "Vonnegut: Which are you?"
- "Q: On a good day?"
- |
  

- Vacillating between the two.
- |
  

- How about you?
- "Vonnegut: Well, I came into this world with a gift."
- |
  

- And that has made all the difference.
- "Q: What do you think it takes to be a good man?"
- "Vonnegut: Oh, I imagine you're born that way."
- |
  

- But only some people find it in themselves.
- |
  

- Some people &#151; a lot of people &#151; find it easy to be perfect.
- |
  

- But most of us are only burdens.
- |
  

- It's a short walk.
- "Q: That's a tough one."
- "Vonnegut: Well, no way to get around it."
- "Q: We were talking earlier about how everyday life is so fraught with close calls and narrow aversions of, to use one of your titles, \"fates worse than death."
- "\" How do you avoid that kind of stuff?"
- |
  

- Do you have any kind of prescription for getting through the next twenty-four hours?
- "Vonnegut: Well."
- |
  

- LSD helps a lot.
- |
  

- Have you experimented with it at all?
- "Q: Nope."
- |
  

- I missed my chance in college.
- "Vonnegut: Neither have I. I guess we'll never know."
- "Q: In 1981, you wrote that if a third world war should ever come, you'd be spry enough to dance again."
- |
  

- You ready to dance?
- "Vonnegut: Sure, I'd love to dance, but not alone."
- |
  

- And women don't like to do it with me.
- "Q: And why is that?"
- "Vonnegut: It's the way I do it."
- "Q: Do I want to pursue this line of questioning any further?"
- "Vonnegut: You'd better not."
- |
  

- Laughs]
- "Q: Do you remember the first story you wrote?"
- "Vonnegut: No. But when I went to Cornell, and I was a big shot on the school paper, I had a column there and I'd make up stories left and right."
- |
  

- You know, 500 words here or there.
- |
  

- It's easy enough to come by.
- "Q: Do you remember any of that stuff?"
- "Vonnegut: No."
- "Q: There is a long string of self-deprecating humor that runs through all of your work."
- |
  

- You've commented many times that you believe your books to be "merely collections of jokes.
- "\" Do you think that sells them a bit short?"
- "Vonnegut: No, not at all."
- |
  

- I think jokes are a perfectly viable form of literature.
- |
  

- Some critics take issue with me because I make my points and discuss my ideas with jokes, rather than with oceanic tragedy.
- "Q: Plenty of writers can do that."
- "Vonnegut: There's room for all of it."
- |
  

- I just prefer the jokes.
- |
  

- You pull them back and let them rip.
- "Q: But at least a couple times, I've been moved to tears by your books."
- |
  

- The passage in  Timequake  when you discuss the last conversation you had with your first wife is devastating.
- "Vonnegut: Yeah."
- |
  

- Long pause] I got that right, didn't I?
- "Q: Perhaps hiding those moments between all of the jokes gives them particular impact."
- "Vonnegut: Well, the telling of jokes is an art of its own, and it always rises from some emotional threat."
- |
  

- The best jokes are dangerous, and dangerous because they are in some way truthful.
- |
  

- By the way, do you know the secret of telling a joke well?
- "Q: [Tries to answer, but he beats me to it]"
- "Vonnegut: TIMING!"
- |
  

- Laughs]
- "Q: See, that one wouldn't work so well on the page."
- "Vonnegut: Yeah, but I got control of your endocrine system."
- |
  

- I had you there, didn't I? See, every successful joke &#151; the ones you're going to get a belly laugh with &#151; starts as a threat to someone or something.
- |
  

- There was a salesman.
- |
  

- His car broke down.
- |
  

- He found a farmhouse nearby, and asked if he could spend the night there.
- |
  

- The farmer says, "Yes, but you'll have to sleep with my daughter.
- "\" See, that's just the set-up."
- |
  

- But it gets peoples' endocrine systems.
- |
  

- It's just a few words, but all kinds of things are happening.
- "Q: In the grander scheme of things, you may have lost position as the baby in your family, but you've still got a world of young readers to entertain."
- "Vonnegut: Well, do you know the one about the man who fell of the cliff?"
- |
  

- And on the way down, he happened to grab on to a very thin branch in the mountainside.
- |
  

- Do you know this one &#151; about praying to God because there was nobody else around?
- |
  

- Laughs] See, I've already threatened you.
- |
  

- Laughs] So this guy is finally praying to God.
- |
  

- He says, "Please, God, help me out here.
- |
  

- Tell me what I should do.
- "\" And God says, \""
- Hello, my son.
- |
  

- I will help you.
- |
  

- Just let go of the branch and I will see that you are safe.
- "\" And the man cries out, \""
- Isn't there anybody else up there I can talk to?
- "\" [Laughs] See how that works?"
- |
  

- Did you see that?
- |
  

- I threatened you.
