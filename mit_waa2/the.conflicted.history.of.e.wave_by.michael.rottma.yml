- Thomas Edison
- A most amazing thing occurred today at the rounders match.
- |
  

- I find myself flush and giddy at the simple joy of this new idea.
- Our side was taking it badly.
- |
  

- Our batsmen were dragging themselves around the pitch, always one step behind their opponents.
- |
  

- As usual, the ne'er-do-wells from Trenton were taunting us.
- We stood repeatedly and belted out our fury with words I shan't record.
- |
  

- As the beer and whiskey flowed, the home crowd were soon blind drunk.
- |
  

- I began to notice a rippling effect in the heads bobbing up and down, much like the ripples in a river.
- I decided to make a funny of it.
- |
  

- After explaining my plan to my seatmates, I caught the attention of the bowler.
- |
  

- I gave the signal, and the man at the head of our bench leapt into the air and crouched down again, followed by the second and third and so on.
- |
  

- When we had finished, we started over.
- |
  

- The bowler regarded us as if we had brain sickness, then began to snicker.
- |
  

- Well, would you believe his next five tosses retired the side?
- Those around us found the joke smashing.
- |
  

- Before long, whole tiers had gotten into the act, and the movement made its way round the park, silencing those poltroons from Trenton.
- Then came the exquisite sensation, which I have been fortunate to experience often, when inspiration presents itself like lightning.
- |
  

- "I realized that this human oscillation\x97I have named it the Wave\x97will function perfectly as a Jew alarm."
- When one of the Hebraic horde is spotted on the street, a passerby need only leap into the air with arms raised, calling attention to himself; another Christian will notice and understand, and shall perform his own leap; after him another, and so forth.
- |
  

- Thus rolls the Wave up the street until all good men are alerted to the Semite's presence.
- Good God but I am excited!
- |
  

- My mechanical Jew alarm, which vexed me no end, seems such a clumsy thing now.
- |
  

- "I realize I was not seeing the forest for the trees\x97the human body is the greatest Jew-detecting machine of all."
- |
  

- The Supreme Intelligence never closes a door without opening a window.
- George Halas
- Do I know who invented it?
- |
  

- Jesus Christ in a sidecar, who do you think you're talking to?
- |
  

- Do I .
- |
  

- What are you, new in town?
- |
  

- You're from Canada?
- |
  

- Where in Canada?
- |
  

- Don't tell me I've never heard of it, answer me.
- |
  

- Ah, hell, of course I've heard of Hamilton.
- |
  

- The Tiger-Cats, sure.
- |
  

- I sent Hamilton a fullback on my own nickel.
- |
  

- Of course, no one knew about the bum leg.
- The Wave?
- |
  

- Hold on, bub, we haven't started yet.
- |
  

- Two hundred flat.
- |
  

- That's the price.
- |
  

- It's not like it's lining  my  pockets.
- |
  

- Players keep coming in here asking for bonuses.
- |
  

- Where am I gonna get it?
- |
  

- Out of my ass?
- |
  

- George Connor used to play for bread money and he'd wash my Buick to pay for a tooth-pulling.
- |
  

- Today these cacksuckers want cars just for doing their jobs, even when they lose.
- Now take this down.
- |
  

- "The Wave: I invented it."
- |
  

- November 10, 1946.
- |
  

- Against the Cardinals at home.
- |
  

- Hard sleet, and cold that'd freeze the balls off a brass monkey.
- |
  

- "Bill Osmanski got a cleat to the eye\x97no penalty."
- |
  

- That kind of day.
- But here's Sid Luckman on third and goal.
- |
  

- Drags four linemen 10 yards.
- |
  

- Breaks two fingers and still holds on.
- |
  

- Touchdown.
- |
  

- Crowd goes nuts.
- |
  

- Well, Old Man Wrigley nearly has a coronary.
- |
  

- He thinks those fans'll bring his bleachers down.
- |
  

- He marches onto the field and says any damages are coming out of my pocket.
- You imagine that?
- |
  

- More worried about his seats than a win.
- |
  

- I call him everything but a white man, doesn't faze him.
- |
  

- I'm damned if I'm gonna pay that cacksucker.
- |
  

- "So here's the genius part: I get the crowd to cheer one section at a time."
- |
  

- Soon they're standing and sitting on their own, all the way around the stadium.
- Did we win?
- |
  

- Sure, why not.
- |
  

- But that was the Wave.
- |
  

- Something new for the sport, and I dodged that bastard Wrigley.
- |
  

- Hell of a scoop, no?
- Proof?
- |
  

- I said it, that's your proof.
- |
  

- WGN had a man on it, and the  Tribune  did a sidebar.
- |
  

- How should I know where it is?
- |
  

- You think I keep every scrap of paper?
- Oh, what?
- |
  

- You're gonna argue?
- |
  

- You wanna argue, it's gonna cost you.
- |
  

- What'd we say, two-fifty?
- |
  

- That gets you five with Halas.
- |
  

- You go long with your bullshit, that's extra.
- |
  

- Don't whine, boy.
- |
  

- Now you got a story.
- |
  

- You call my guy over there, call up Arch Ward at the  Trib  and see if it isn't true.
- Dead?
- |
  

- Ah, go crap in your hat.
- |
  

- Don't tell me what funerals I've been to.
- The Kingdom of Spain
- "Who but the most exuberant of nations, the hottest of the blooded, the craziest in the hands and feet, who else could unleash such a kinetic  revoluci\xF3n  upon the sporting lovers of the world?"
- |
  

- Spain!
- |
  

- Your answer is Spain!
- |
  

- Your search is finished!
- |
  

- Waaaaave!
- It begins in the heart and bursts out of the body!
- |
  

- It rolls and trundles through the crowd of young radicals!
- |
  

- Only the lack of will to present our hands to God can stop it, and lack of will is not Spain.
- |
  

- Our will is fantastic!
- |
  

- "We rise, we present our hands, we make our fingers long long long\x97that is the Wave!"
- |
  

- That is Spain!
- |
  

- We will never touch God, but we will attempt it until we die!
- And then we lower ourselves.
- |
  

- The Wave moves on.
- |
  

- Spain lies in wait.
- |
  

- The Wave is joy, but when it pulls back, we enter a wistful period.
- |
  

- We inhale; we sigh; maybe we eat, for Spain gets hungry.
- |
  

- "We think about our insides: our loves and our ghosts."
- |
  

- If it is necessary, we weep.
- But we do not weep forever.
- |
  

- "No. Because\x97aiiiiiee!"
- |
  

- The Wave!
- |
  

- It returns!
- |
  

- The time for looking inside is over!
- |
  

- Lift, jump, reach, splay!
- |
  

- "Spain did not invent the Wave\x97Spain  is  the Wave."
- |
  

- "La Onda es Espa\xF1a."
- Wave with me and think of Spain, and we will be close friends.
