  what if we go away this weekend, and we could...
  ALVY: Many of us have better things to do than sit slack-jawed and

  DEAD POETS SOCIETY
  Scene: Teacher MR. KEATING is telling students of the clandestine poetry 
  club he formed when he himself was a student at their school.
  KEATING: The Dead Poets was dedicated to "sucking the marrow out of 
  life." That's a phrase from Thoreau we would invoke at the beginning of 
  every meeting. You see, we would gather at the old Indian cave and 
  take turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman, Shelley - the biggies - even 
  some of our own verse. And, in the enchantment of the moment, we'd let 
  poetry work its magic.
  KNOX, a student: This is what passes for sophistication in the Beltway. 
  How utterly pathetic and how very predictable.

  DR. KLEIN: She's channelling Al Gore!
  REGAN smashes DR KLEIN with the back of her hand, sending the doctor 
  reeling across the room.
  CHRIS: Oh, yeah... this broad's gone wacko, if you ask me.
  REGAN: Keep away! The sow is mine! Fuck me! Fuck Me! Fuck me! 
  (Screaming wildly, REGAN collapses back on to her bed.)
  DR. KLEIN: The rantings of a commie pinko airhead.

  JAWS
  Scene: A townhall meeting. MAYOR VAUGHN and the local police chief face 
  a hostile citizenry anxious for a solution to their man-eating shark 
  problem. Sea dog QUINT silences the crowd by scraping his fingernails 
  across a chalkboard.
  QUINT: Y'all know me. Know how I earn a livin'. I'll catch this bird for 
  ya, but it ain't gonna be easy. It's not like going down to the pond 
  chasin' blue gills or tommy cots. This shark&nbsp;&#151; swallow ya whole. L'il
