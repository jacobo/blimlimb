- You are eating a pint of ice cream.
- |
  

- A humming sound comes from the Abinator wrapped around your waist.
- |
  

- Life is a delicate balance, with one act canceling out the other, until we are all perfectly balanced.
- Picture the sound of one hand clapping.
- |
  

- Now imagine the sound of one mouthwash user gargling.
- |
  

- Your halitosis will return unless you compulsively check your breath every five minutes.
- |
  

- Now open your eyes.
- |
  

- Make sure no one is in front of you.
- |
  

- Breathe out.
- |
  

- You feel enlightenment, right?
- Life is a circle, an arc, a rainbow.
- |
  

- Your dog ran away two weeks ago, yet you still have three bags of Kibbles and Bits, waiting for his return.
- |
  

- Forget all that stuff I said about rainbows, life is about the abundance of nothingness.
- Today you need to let go of the anger you feel toward others.
- |
  

- Some things are out of your control, and you must learn to accept that.
- |
  

- Other things are firmly in your control, like the way you made a complete ass of yourself at the executive director's dinner party.
- |
  

- Remember, all the healing power in the world can't repair the damage to the host's couch.
- |
  

- You need to lay off the tequila.
- Burn a candle that has a scent reminiscent of a rushing waterfall.
- |
  

- See and hear the waterfall in your mind.
- |
  

- Pray to the higher power of your choice that the sound of the rushing waterfall will drown out the noise of the people next door having sex.
- |
  

- How long has it been since you have had sex, anyway?
- Today I will be able to truly comprehend the meaning of love in the universe.
- |
  

- I will see it has nothing to do with the fact that I am overweight.
- |
  

- Instead, I will accept that it has much more to do with the fact that I don't make any money.
- Sit in the lotus position.
- |
  

- See the day before you as a crystal rainbow spectrum, with each color representing an aspect of your day.
- |
  

- Violet represents the lack of hot water available in your bathroom.
- |
  

- Brown is the color of that spot on the carpet where your dog celebrated his return.
- |
  

- Orange is the color of citrus fruits.
- |
  

- You need to eat more citrus fruits.
- |
  

- Now lean back and pull the covers completely over your head.
- |
  

- Ignore the alarm.
- |
  

- There.
- |
  

- That's better.
- |
