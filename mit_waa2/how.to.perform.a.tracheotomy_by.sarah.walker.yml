- First, go to a fancy restaurant that has waiters with accents who wear tuxedos and a rolling dessert table.
- |
  

- Be with a significant other and clink your glasses of red wine while staring lovingly at each other, across the single tapered white candle in the middle of the table.
- |
  

- Then, notice a person who is choking on food, probably a fancy meat.
- |
  

- This person should be a husky middle-aged man, preferably balding, whose equally husky, curly-haired wife is looking on, horrified, clutching her pearl necklace and screeching, "Somebody help him!
- |
  

- He's choking!
- Excuse yourself from your date, throw your white linen napkin down on the white linen tablecloth, and rush over to the choking man.
- |
  

- Attempt to give him the Heimlich, but when this fails, calmly realize what must be done.
- |
  

- The fancy meat is lodged in his throat and this man requires a tracheotomy.
- |
  

- Always address the wife as Susan.
- "\"Susan, Earl requires a tracheotomy."
- Always address the choking victim as Earl.
- Assure Susan that you are a doctor and be sure to have made up a doctor badge that you can show her.
- |
  

- It should be made of pure gold with something like five snakes engraved on it.
- |
  

- You probably aren't a doctor.
- |
  

- If you are, good for you.
- |
  

- That must've taken a long time.
- |
  

- You must be very proud and possibly wealthy.
- Susan will nod her head in assent, too scared to speak.
- |
  

- Place the back of your hand on her cheek and say, "Don't worry, Susan.
- |
  

- I didn't go to doctor school for 11 years to let Earl die.
- Then lay Earl on his back on the floral-carpeted floor.
- Make sure a hushed silence falls over the restaurant as waiters and diners and kitchen staff peeking out of the kitchen look nervously on.
- Remove from your breast pocket a custom-engraved Tiffany sterling-silver pen, which was given to you on your 17th birthday and which you always carry around for such occasions.
- |
  

- It should say something like "Happy Birthday, [ your name ]" and then the date of your birth.
- Before you go to the restaurant, but only after you've secured your paisley ascot, replace the pen tip with an X-Acto knife.
- Raise the pen above your head and click the button so that the X-Acto knife pops out and wait for a gasp from the crowd and for a young boy to drop his fork and have it clatter on his plate.
- |
  

- Twist the "penknife" just so, so that the candlelight gleams off it. It would be nice if, when the light hits it, there could be a  ding  sound effect. Maybe you could arrange to have your significant other tap a wine glass with a fork at that moment.
- Then, in one swift movement, jab the pen into Earl's neck, more or less around the throatish area.
- Earl will pop up, gasping, the pen dangling comically from his neck.
- |
  

- Do not be distracted by this, as you will have to catch Susan, who, with her hand on her forehead, will be falling into a swoon.
- Wait for applause, then pull the smelling salts out of your other breast pocket and revive Susan.
- Then signal to the waiter and say, "Check, please!
- Pause for relieved laughter and applause from the crowd.
- Be prepared for a bear hug from post-smelling-salts Susan.
- |
  

- And for an endless pumping handshake from Earl, who will also give you $200 because he's a wealthy industrialist and carries hundred-dollar bills in his pockets.
- Wear an extra shirt so the hearty pats on the back from the kitchen staff and waiters don't hurt you too much.
- Develop calluses on your hands beforehand by doing a lot of pull-ups, so all the handshakes you receive from your fellow diners don't chafe your carefully manicured hands.
- No need to bring your wallet, as dinner will obviously be on the house, so make sure you've ordered the most expensive things on the menu.
- |
  

- Plus, you have two hundo from Earl.
- Don't forget to ask for your pen back.
