- Two people sit at the back of a night bus making its way towards Finsbury Park.
- |
  

- It is two in the morning.
- |
  

- He has a French accent.
- |
  

- Hers is American.
- |
  

- His arm is around her shoulders.
- |
  

- "Woman: So it wasn't a real stroke."
- |
  

- Or it wasn't a crippling stroke.
- |
  

- Do you know what a stroke is?
- "Man: Yes."
- "Woman: I don't know how to say it in French."
- "Man: Yes."
- "Woman: Un mal de."
- |
  

- "Man: Yes, I know what it is."
- "Woman: Well, it wasn't a major one but it was still, you know."
- |
  

- "Man: It was a stroke."
- "Woman: And when my dad phoned I could just tell it was trouble."
- |
  

- First of all, they never call me past ten at night.
- |
  

- They're both very aware when it comes to different timezones, with me being so far ahead.
- "Man: France is even further."
- "Woman: France is what?"
- "Man: In my country we are later."
- |
  

- We are one hour forward.
- "Woman: Well England is, like,  five  hours later than Baltimore, so I knew something was up."
- |
  

- You get that feeling in your throat.
- |
  

- And you know when your father comes on the phone &#151; I don't know if this has ever happened to you &#151; but your father comes on the phone and he sounds like someone else?
- "Man: You look beautiful."
- "Woman: And."
- |
  

- "Man: In this light."
- "Woman: ."
- |
  

- Sorry?
- "Man: I was worried that when we got outside the club you wouldn't be as beautiful as you were inside."
- |
  

- Not so.
- |
  

- This bus does not have good light, but you are still beautiful.
- "Woman: Thanks."
- "Man: Your hair."
- "Woman: That's sweet."
- |
  

- That's really.
- |
  

- So.
- |
  

- Dad.
- |
  

- Sorry to go back to this.
- "Man: No, no, no."
- "Woman: My dad told me that mom had been making strange noises in the night, moving the sheets, that kind of thing."
- |
  

- When he woke up she was having a stroke.
- |
  

- Or she had just had it.
- "Man: We are three stops from my house right now."
- "Woman: And."
- |
  

- And so he got her to the hospital as fast as he could, which was lucky because our car?
- |
  

- It's a wonder anyone can even drive the thing with its back end almost ninety percent rusted off.
- |
  

- My dad walks everywhere now because we've only been at this new house for six months.
- |
  

- He's all about walking.
- |
  

- It used to be biking but then he was like "No, you can only begin to understand a city if you walk its streets.
- "\" That kind of thing."
- |
  

- So it was just lucky that when he turned the ignition the car actually started.
- |
  

- He drove there as fast as he could.
- "Man: Is she dead?"
- "Woman: No, it was just a  small  stroke."
- |
  

- A petit.
- |
  

- "Man: This was your mother who had the stroke?"
- "Woman: Yes."
- "Man: And your father is black?"
- "Woman: Yes."
- "Man: And your mother is white?"
- "Woman: Yes."
- |
  

- And, you know, her recovery has just been amazing.
- |
  

- She did the whole walking on a treadmill, the whole physical therapy thing.
- |
  

- Her face after it happened was twisted.
- |
  

- It was like the nerve endings had been damaged.
- |
  

- But somehow she's really improved it through exercises and she looks, I'd say, about ninety-five percent as good as she looked before.
- |
  

- If you knew her before you might be able to tell, but it's not like people stare.
- "Man: Why do they stare?"
- "Woman: No, they  don't  stare."
- |
  

- She's recovered.
- "Man: And are your parents able to hold hands in public?"
- "Woman: Oh, they're totally affectionate."
- |
  

- I've been so proud of my dad, how he's handled it?
- |
  

- Out of all my friend's parents I'd say eighty percent are divorced.
- |
  

- So my parents are in the minority.
- |
  

- But they're so in love, so there for each other, kissing at the table, that kind of stuff, which is kind of weird when it's people that age.
- |
  

- But you know what's really weird?
- |
  

- The only lasting effect of the stroke is that my mom will just forget easy words for things around her.
- |
  

- Like the water will be running in the sink?
- |
  

- And she'll say, "Turn off the.
- |
  

- "\" And she'll point at it and sort of shake her finger at it, and I'll be like, \""
- Mom, do you mean the faucet?
- "\" And she'll say, \""
- Yes, the faucet.
- "\" That kind of stuff happens all the time, and I know it's got something to do with the stroke."
- "Man: I love your black skin."
- "Woman: And."
- |
  

- "Man: I love the way it gets darker around your crinkles."
- |
  

- Your wrinkles I mean.
- |
  

- Around your eyes you are very black.
- "Woman: Thanks."
- "Man: We are two more stops from my house now."
- |
  

- It is up this hill.
- |
  

- That's the park over there I told you about.
- |
  

- And that is the store where I do my shopping.
- |
  

- It's owned by Arabs.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Woman: So, I mean, not to keep dwelling on this."
- |
  

- I guess what I meant to say is that my mother is Okay.
- |
  

- But it just makes you think how precious life is.
- |
  

- And how.
- |
  

- "Man: Have you heard of a band called The Strokes?"
- "Woman: A what?"
- "Man: A band."
- |
  

- They are called The Strokes.
- |
  

- Just because you were mentioning strokes one second ago.
- "Woman: No."
- "Man: They are very popular."
- "Woman: I don't even, you know, have a stereo over here."
- "Man: I have a Sony stereo."
- |
  

- The Strokes CD is very good.
- |
  

- You will like them.
- |
  

- I am going to play two of their songs for you when we get to my place.
- |
  

- Number five is very fast.
- |
  

- Number one is slower.
- |
  

- I think number five is better but it will be interesting to hear what you say.
- |
  

- Is that fine?
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Man: Do you think that's fine?"
- "Woman: Sure."
- "Man: Do you like rock and roll?"
- "Woman: Yeah, I sort of like everything."
- "Man: Or do you like rap music all the time?"
