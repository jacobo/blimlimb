  1. The kittens turn to me for help, paws outstretched, eyes beseeching.  I 
  save them from the danger, despite my degenerative illness and other sundry 
  obstacles.  A local radio station interviews me, but takes my quotes out of 
  context.
  2. A man&nbsp;&#151; a representative of a Japanese handbag concern&nbsp;&#151; offers me the sum 
  of one million American dollars to license my eyes for billboard 
  reproductions.  These billboards will line the streets of Tokyo, Kobe, and, if
