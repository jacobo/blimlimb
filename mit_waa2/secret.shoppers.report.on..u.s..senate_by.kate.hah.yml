- Store entrance has too many steps, not welcoming.
- |
  

- Also, no sign!
- |
  

- Would not have found it without dome.
- |
  

- Workers well-dressed but many not at stations.
- |
  

- Took 15 minutes to acknowledge me.
- |
  

- Would not return to this location if other options were available.
- |
  

- Group of men who were obviously supposed to be greeters (elderly, white hair, frail) not at door but sitting in seats.
- |
  

- Guess they were tired (age), but still .
- |
  

- At least smile like at Wal-Mart.
- |
  

- "Also, d\xE9cor could use updating."
- |
  

- Why all the blue and gold?
- |
  

- "What is this\x97a Masons lodge?"
- |
  

- Store's brand identity not really clear.
- |
  

- "What exactly is \"The People's Business\"? Example: Female employee had large chart on easel and was going on and on about health care, and then male employee came up with different chart and said opposite thing about health care. What? Could not even find health-care aisle. There seemed to be only one aisle, and little or no signage."
- |
  

- Gavel-banging sound really annoying and distracting when trying to shop.
- |
  

- "Enjoyed adjacent cafeteria\x97up until emergency evacuation."
- |
  

- Returned after "all clear" to find my soup cold. Was told they do not offer refund even if "false alarm.
- |
  

- Approached group of workers whispering to each other.
- |
  

- They stopped when I walked up.
- |
  

- Felt like nuisance instead of customer.
- |
  

- Tried to make purchase but was instructed to return with larger bills.
- |
  

- Not friendly like when I see them on those commercials on CNN or FOX.
- |
  

- Sixty-something white male employee in blue suit made inappropriate sexual remark, then hid by blending into group of men who looked just like him.
- |
  

- "Hello\x97need name badges."
- |
  

- And sensitivity training.
- |
  

- Had to wait outside for store to open.
- |
  

- Staff very late getting there with keys.
- |
  

- "Most arrived in limos (wow\x97I want to work here!"
- |
  

- "\"vote."
- "\" On what?"
- |
  

- Before entering store, saw attractive young female customer arguing with male employee (gray hair, blue suit), and then suddenly van pulled up, some guy got out and put hood over her head, dragged her in, and drove away.
- |
  

- "Wow\x97is this what happens when you challenge store's return policy!"
- |
  

- I said "boo" to employee and she hit the floor, cowering. Others did same. Seem to think they are under siege or something. Promised to build highways in my state if I would only let them live. Um ... don't need another highway, thanks. And wasn't going to kill you.
- |
  

- Attempted to visit but closed.
- |
  

- Guard said store closed for a month.
- |
  

- I asked if they were remodeling and he told me not to loiter.
- |
  

- Well, OK.
- |
  

- I'm just trying to spend some money!
- |
  

- Also, maybe they could get friendlier guards.
- |
  

- "IMHO: Competitor will  not  have trouble entering this market."
