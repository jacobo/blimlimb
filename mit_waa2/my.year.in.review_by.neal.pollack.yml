- Some years, I'm sure you're aware, just plod along.
- |
  

- The farmer tills his soil, the workers watch the clock until 8 PM, when they're allowed to leave the office and go to their second job, the lonely drunk cuts another finger on another shard of glass.
- |
  

- But other years explode in a shower of joy.
- |
  

- Such was my year this year, and what a year it was.
- |
  

- You all know, by now, that this year was the year I published a book and went on an epic nine-month tour that took me to 70 cities on five continents.
- |
  

- But you may not know that I also got married, turned 30, quit my job, and bought a spacious house in the most glamorous city in North America.
- I realize, as do you all, that after January 20, when the son of Satan assumes office, my fairly-won pleasures will be stripped from me one at a time, but I still have three weeks to enjoy them.
- |
  

- And I must say that without you, such delectable sweetmeats wouldn't have been possible.
- |
  

- May I have this space today to thank all the people who made up  this year?
- |
  

- May I usurp this website for nothing more than self-indulgent liner notes?
- |
  

- Please allow me.
- |
  

- I have had a big year, and I want to celebrate.
- First, let me run down a few people who have been essential throughout the process, before I begin going city by city, in my plodding, dutiful, predictable way.
- |
  

- My wife Regina, and my parents, Susan and Bernie Pollack, must top any list.
- |
  

- Following them closely would be that salty old draught horse Todd Pruzan, and John Kellogg Hodgman, detective, my friend and former agent.
- |
  

- I would also like to thank, high up, Diane Vadino, Sarah K. Min, and the McSweeney's interns, Matt Fogel, Ted Thompson, Lawrence Lowe, Ben White, and Tanner Colby, who made many phone calls on my behalf when my line had been shut off from overuse.
- |
  

- My webmaster and yours, Kevin Shay, brought us all so much this year, and props to him as well, and let us not forget Windsor Beaver, who made the book look beautiful, and Shlyo Bisnett, who did so much and asked for so little.
- |
  

- In addition, many authors, some more famous than others, you know who you are, gave me encouragement and advice, both romantic and non-,and Jonathan Menjivar, who, among all people, knows the truth.
