- "Dear Readers: Please note that in addition to the several literary love affairs I predict below, my wife has permitted me to conduct three additional liaisons on my book tour, as they will be good for my ego, and hence my career."
- |
  

- These affairs are to last 72 hours apiece, or less, will be physical, spiritual and intellectual in nature, and can be with either men or women.
- |
  

- If you wish to have an affair with me, draw a heart on the title page of my book.
- |
  

- You may also elect to draw any other bodily organ, which may increase or decrease your chances, depending on my mood that day.
- |
  

- I will examine you, and if I choose you, I will put an arrow through your heart, or other organ.
- |
  

- You will then be taken to a special corner where you will wait for me until I declare it is time for the affair to begin.
- |
  

- We will share such tender moments, together.
- |
  

- Now, on with today's piece.

- Perhaps the most advantageous aspect of literary celebrity, as I am now learning, is that you can control every single thing that happens to you.
- |
  

- The world bows prostrate at your holy feet, and your mandates are close to, if not actually, words from God.
- |
  

- I have realized that, when you are a famous writer, the magazine and newspaper folk cover you not because they want to, but because they need to; they are gripped by a moral imperative stronger than anything in their previous experience.
- |
  

- "Indeed, over the last few months, I have felt like the boy in that legendary episode of  The Twilight Zone :  Whatever I imagine comes true."
- Therefore, what you are about to read is a reliable guide, because I have deemed it so.
- |
  

- It is, or will be, my life, writ.
- |
  

- Not everything predicted below is happy fate, because fate is not always happy.
- |

- |
  

- So read this and understand, my friends, for my destiny is that of every writer.
