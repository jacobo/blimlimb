  I don't like prisms, either, and I don't particularly trust refracted light. And glass has even infected our language. It's in popular phrases such as \"glass ceiling\" and \"glass jaw\" and \"glass cutter.\" It's in \"eyeglasses,\" even though many lenses are actually made of plastic. We drink from a \"glass,\" but do we serve our food in a \"porcelain\" or cut it with a \"steel\"? Call me old-fashioned, but I just don't understand all the fuss about glass.

  Wait. Sweater? What?\n\
  Of course, English has other words I can do without besides \"glass.\" One of the things that make the English language so wonderful is its suppleness, but sometimes we go too far. Pointless words such as \"bling-bling\" and \"coot\" and \"rambling\" have infiltrated our dictionary, our most cherished reference manual. I remember when \"market\" was just a noun and when any baby animal was a \"piglet.\" Oh, sure, English still had a lot of words back then, but it was manageable.
