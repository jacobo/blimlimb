- Oh, look what I've done to my pretty new dress!
- |
  

- It looks like that nacho platter I was making spilled all over my lap.
- |
  

- If only someone could lick this hot Monterey Jack off of me .
- |
  

- Yeah, right there is perfect.
- |
  

- Why don't you come to my site and see what I've got waiting in the oven for you?
- |
  

- I'll give you a hint .

- Are you all by yourself tonight baby?
- |
  

- I just bought a new webcam, and it's all set up and ready to go.

- Click here if you want to watch the Mets game tonight, or if you like, I've still got March Madness on my TiVo.
- |
  

- Is my head in the way baby?
- |
  

- I'll move it.
- |
  

- Last words that cum out of my mouth, I promise.

- "From: Lucy Clothesless"
- "Subject: What's up?"
- I'm looking for a hot man in my life.
- |
  

- But realistically, I think my personality meshes better with someone more average, so I can be the really attractive one in the relationship.
- |
  

- You know, someone who's really good at Frolf and boasts an encyclopedic knowledge of Arnold Schwarzenegger movie quotes.
- |
  

- Are you that someone?

- "From: Boredhousewife"
- "Subject: Plans for tonight?"
- I'm sitting all by myself at home, and I'm sooooo bored.
- |
  

- I was thinking about inviting some of my friends over for some *fun*.
- |
  

- You'll be playing poker with your friends tonight, right?
- |
  

- OK, we'll probably just watch Grey's Anatomy and go to sleep early.
- |
  

- Have fun!
