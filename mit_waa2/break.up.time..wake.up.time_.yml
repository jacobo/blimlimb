  There is one mind common to individual men. Every mind is an inlet to
  the same and to all of the same. But sometimes my mind seems to get just
  a little bit crazy -- at least, such as it happened, one awful week back
  in 1819.
  Janice and I had been courting for an entire year; a span which, as is
  widely known, presents itself to the high-schooler as an eternity. Our
  love seemed a fire that, having kindled its first embers in the nook of
  a private bosom, enlarged until it warmed and beamed upon multitudes of
  men and women, upon the universal heart of all, lighting up all nature
  with its generous flames. One Sunday, however, I was surprised by her
  unexpected appearance at my bed-room door: "There's something I must
  tell you."
  That we would conduct a 'relationship talk' was manifest; but its
  terrible import, ah! I knew not then.
  "Last night Jeffrey Roth and I pitched fierce woo," she informed me,
  "and I have pledged my heart to him." She followed with the usual: "I
  would never do anything to hurt you, Ralph. I shall always love you."
  My face must have turned white, for I felt the blood leave me, much as
  the flowing river pours for a season its streams into the sea.  I
  trembled with anger, sinking into the soft arms of that Unity, that
  Over-soul, within which every man's particular being is contained and
  made one with all other; the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the
  universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related;
  the All-Seeing Eye, from which Jeffrey and Janice's misdeeds find no
  safe harbour; the eternal ONE.
  Janice was disarmed by my solitary reverie. "Must you be like this?" she
  asked. "Can we not be friends?"
  I desired to strike her, repeatedly, in the shoulder, until the whole of
  her arm became swollen and distended and, consequently, un-useable; but
  instead I could only stammer: "Please, leave me now. I will see you in
  classes to-morrow."
  What blessed power guided me through those next few, horrid hours? I sat
  on my bed and cried and cried; I attempted to consume an entire gallon
  of buttermilk; I thought morosely of Janice as I played our favorite
  hymns, over and over, on my tiny bed-room harmonium. Due to our mutual
  participation in the Divine Mind, my mother sensed my agony and brought
  in a plate of her trademark apple fritters.
  "Mother," I asked, "why must it hurt so much?"
  My mother looked at me lovingly, her eyes sad and serious, but her tone
  conspiratorial. "The answer to your question, my son, lurks right above
  your head."
  Above my head? I slowly turned my gaze skyward... and there, tacked
  above my bed, was a treasured lithograph of my boyhood idol, the
  18th-century spiritualist Emanuel Swedenborg. I immediately thought, as
  my dear mother must have, of Swedenborg's New Jerusalem, #191, which
  reads, "Inner struggles help our good traits and true ideas to get
  control over our bad traits and false ideas. They strengthen the truth
  in us and unite it with our good parts."
  Ah, crafty mother! Ah, trusty Swedenborg! Forever, in my heart, will you
  remain - the twin suns of my being!
