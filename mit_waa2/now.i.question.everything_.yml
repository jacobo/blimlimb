- I would lose my job, I would be arrested, I would not be able to speak to my family, he would drag my family through the mud.

- He basically said that he was either taking me or that piece of paper.
- |
  

- What do you do?
- |
  

- So I signed it.
- I thought I would be able to get away, to get back to my office, to be able to think.

- He said, "Wait here.
- "\" We got out of the car and he went to his car and he got his gun, a huge gun, and he stuck it in his belt, and he walked me around through the woods."

- He was just threatening me again.
