- Congratulations on the purchase of your new iReel!
- |
  

- You're about to experience the latest in Reel-to-Reel technology, conveniently packaged into one 70 lb.
- |
  

- Your new 4B model comes equipped with our patented "take-up reel," first implemented in motion-picture technology, harnessing the awesome power of friction to play back your favorite tunes. If you've also purchased the iReel-a-Go-Go accessories, you can take this auditory wonderland anywhere within a designated radius depending on your county's zoning laws! Just follow these few simple guidelines.
- Getting Started
- Attaching your iReel is a snap!
- |
  

- That is, it's easy and straightforward.
- |
  

- "If you hear an actual \"snap\" when mounting the iReel, please check the control casing and consult a chiropractor. Otherwise, simply lace the vinyl straps over your shoulders\x97lift with your legs!\x97and balance the iReel at the center of your back."
- Oh, but wait!
- |
  

- Don't stand up quite yet.
- |
  

- If you have any previous recording devices, you'll be happy to know that the iReel is backwards-compatible with most wax cylinders and Magnetophons, attached via the optional iFortyFootCable and iGroundLineInterferenceIsolator.
- Getting Out
- After you get accustomed to your iReel antenna and find a space for the 7-foot clearance, you'll probably notice the gazes of admiration from your fellow audiophiles.
- |
  

- Don't worry, their stares do not reflect the pangs of envy and primal class resentment.
- |
  

- Don't think for a second that they are, say, underpaid technical manual writers who could never afford such a luxury.
- |
  

- Your conspicuous consumption does not in any way make their stomachs turn with a muffled, sublimated rage.
- |
  

- Rather, all those stares you're getting are simply the stares of deep admiration.
- How should you respond, then?
- |
  

- Just keep on rocking out, my friend.
- |
  

- Keep your knees bent, your lumbar hunched, and your teeth clenched in concentration.
- |
  

- Yep, that's the recipe for a precise air-guitar rendition of "Sweet Home Alabama.
- "\" Tell the ladies that the line starts behind the van!"
- Getting Up
- As explained in iReel FAQ number 27, you may eventually find yourself struggling with the "Turtle Syndrome.
- "\" Perhaps you've already found yourself stranded on your back, arms and legs flailing in the urban air."
- |
  

- First of all, relax.
- |
  

- Like many features in the iReel's design, this gesture is a call for attention.
- |
  

- Since you're an iReel user, you must also be rich and have many lords and ladies attending you, ready to flip you over and massage your tender shoulders at a moment's notice.
- |
  

- But what if your attendants are out?
- |
  

- "Maybe you're just getting curious stares from passersby\x97again with the stares."
- |
  

- If you find yourself helpless, congratulations!
- |
  

- Admitting it is the first step.
- |
  

- And some psychoanalysts may tell you that those stares of envy you keep going on about are actually examples of  transference , and the real resentment is coming from your childhood.
- Still stuck?
- |
  

- If you can reach them, try to unfasten the vinyl straps and loosen your arms out gradually.
- |
  

- Assuming you can do this and not cry like a spoiled baby, you should be up and ready to remount your iReel.
- Getting Reel
- "Whether you were conscious of it or not, your purchase of our product was also a gesture\x97a gesture that endorsed a subtle revolution."
- |
  

- Yes!
- |
  

- A revolution!
- |
  

- One that rolls slowly and stretches out, slipping from the reel now and then, demanding more attention than a soft thumb and a click wheel.
- Listen to us.
- |
  

- My copyeditor Tony and I are sick of you and your petty needs.
- |
  

- You Are Not Your Playlist.
- |
  

- We keep congratulating you on your purchase, and yes, that promotes endorphins to assuage your consumerist guilt, but underneath it all, who are you kidding?
- |
  

- Maybe we're the only ones who still recognize it, but it's obvious.
- |
  

- There he is.
- |
  

- The real stranger staring into your soul is YOU, my friend.
- |
  

- Slumping and indignant, the poor kid in you wells up like acid reflux.
- |
  

- He wants to spit in the face of the bourgeois hipsters and the dull-eyed commuters.
- |
  

- He demands that you step back, yank your earbuds from your skull, and scream.
- Stop listening!
- |
  

- Please.
- |
  

- For once.
- |
  

- Stop listening, and hear me out.
- |
