- This is the fourth in a series of dispatches from Italy.
- Read parts  one ,   two ,   three ,   five ,   six ,  seven ,
- |
  

- TROPEA&#8212;There is a photo on each tomb in the musty stacks that grid Tropea's only cemetery.
- |
  

- I skipped my eyes over them like a savvy stone across a slavering ocean, touching down to pay only the most economical of respects, but was sunk by a little girl named Tinnucia.
- |
  

- Only three when she died in 1954, her tomb was engraved corner to corner with script.
- |
  

- Her face was darkly angelic, each pierced ear flashing from the blackest recess of an artfully practiced curl.
- |
  

- There seemed to be a lot to remember about this face, at once too old and too young.
- |
  

- The text on her tomb took up eight lines in my notebook; I couldn't translate completely but it seemed like a plea from the family.
- |
  

- What had happened to this slyly innocent child in perfect Tropea?
- |
  

- Did little girls die here as well?
- |
  

- The words " le nostre la crime " held me there, searching her wan, untrusting face.
- Down a few stairs there was a monument of sorts, a wide, white berth, at the top of which rested the obligatory photo.
- |
  

- This time it was a young couple, their matching grins set off by the blindingly white hull of a sailboat.
- |
  

- They were 19 when they died on Christmas Day, 1998.
- |
  

- "Again, my poor Italian thwarted me, and for the first time I longed for the company of another: Caterina, Serbian translator of Italian into English par excellence."
- |
  

- Did the quote from the couple read "Since we ARE no longer living in this world&#8230;" or "Since we CAN no longer live in this world&#8230;"?
- |
  

- "I watched their faces for a tell, a suicidally raised eyebrow or sentient pull of the mouth until their smiles resolved into curdled question marks: did the fresh flowers at these graves attest to epically swollen, endless grief or cleareyed dedication to convention?"
- Most North American cemeteries are golf courses jumbled with stone-clad non sequiturs, at best.
- |
  

- I haunt them nonetheless, running in the big ones, hiding in small ones with a boy I desperately want to kiss.
- |
  

- The final lines of  Middlemarch  trail behind me like a plane-pulled banner past regulars and Hall of Famers (I.
- |
  

- "Fell, Richard Blewett) alike: \"the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs."
- "\" It was the gentle defense of obscurity that devastated me at 22; all of those faithless tombs, narratives reduced to sentence fragments."
- |
  

- That "
- |
  

- "\" was of no comfort to me."
- |
  

- "I remember turning out the light to sleep, pulling the book to my chest and murmuring: \""
- I visit them.
- My uncle is buried in the huge cemetery where I run at home, yet for years I couldn't find him.
- |
  

- Every morning I pounded past the stone rows, knowing he was in there somewhere, and I waited.
- |
  

- I wanted it to just happen.
- |
  

- I always want things to just happen.
- |
  

- I never kissed the boy.
- "Last year, waiting on Sorrento's pier for a boat to Capri, I was approached by a boy with eyes like bottled antifreeze: garish blue shot through a sheen of white."
- |
  

- I am reluctant charmee where locals are concerned &#8212; it's time-consuming more than anything &#8212; but something about Anti-Freeze was genuinely warm; by the time we got to the island he had reasoned himself out of returning to work and I had half-witted myself onto the back of his motorcycle.
- |
  

- Within a couple hours we were a young married couple and I was on the other side of an enviable, hair-whipping tour of the island.
- |
  

- Ultimately, however, I slipped from him with relief, protestations of visiting me that night in Sorrento on his end and promises to call and confirm on mine.
- On a pier bench hours later I watched the lame duck sun, having, in its final minutes, cleared the volcanic haze, slip demurely into the sea.
- |
  

- The murk is ever-present in the daytime, and finds tenuous purchase on the bridge of your nose, displacing checks and balances across the body like ill-fitting glasses, but in the moments before sunset, Capri appears on the horizon.
- |
  

- The last boat from the island arrived, and I watched the faces of the sun-splashed passengers tiding by me in chastened, chatty trances.
- |
  

- Then they were gone, taking the sun with them, leaving me with the cats and a stiffening wind.
- Checking out the next day, I left a note and memento at the hotel for my friend, with plans to call from Rome offering instructions and apologies.
- |
  

- In Rome, days earlier, I had targeted a remote landmark with the intention of marking a small portion of its base with finely spun strands of gum.
- |
  

- I had determined gum to be the most enduring of media, perfect for sticky communiqu&eacute;s strung out in vain.
- |
  

- Ah, the notes fired off around this country, I launch them like halfhearted satellites.
- The Tunisian men I ran by every day on my way to Reggio's boardwalk stood out on the corner of a massive intersection.
- |
  

- They charged into traffic at every red light to pour water on unsuspecting windshields and mess it around with questionable vigor.
- |
  

- Did anything of mine strike them as deeply as their squeegee-stuffed  Beauty and the Beast  backpacks propped on the curb had struck me?
- |
  

- "Such fits of legacy pique writ miniature remind me of Caterina: she was probably uneasy about being alone with Raffaello, our Spanish professor, whose nocturnal arias she found unbearable."
- |
  

- Did he hear me singing at night, and was it unbearable?
- |
  

- He left the apartment while I was making my final, take-away dinner in Reggio and I returned his goodbye with no indication of its finality.
- |
  

- Perhaps because I took an instant dislike to a man who would leave the seat up in a bathroom he shared with two girls.
- |
  

- Perhaps not.
- Caterina's toothbrush, mummified in an orange plastic bag, was initially set on the sink, then dangled from a nail above the sink, then, inexplicably &#8212; perhaps as some sort of passive-aggressive reproval &#8212; it moved across the bathroom and over the toilet, where another incongruous screw jutted from the wall.
- |
  

- Raffaello's toothbrush, when it appeared after three days of suspense, was encased in a high-falutin', blue and green plastic baguette.
- |
  

- He staked it &#8212; rather audaciously &#8212; in the prime real estate behind the faucets.
- |
  

- Frankly, it was a little too close to mine for comfort; I felt that he was making a statement with his baldly sinkist stance, clearly filibustering our germs.
- |
  

- He opted not to grace my Colgate Total and Caterina's Kolystone with his toothpaste's presence.
- It struck me one morning, however, that there was a rather uncharacteristic crumple to my tube.
- |
  

- I let it go, not least of all because I am a worthless pagan.
- |
  

- I made laughable attempts to rest my brush on top of the tube of toothpaste, lest it be sullied, but it was for Caterina's sake rather than mine.
- |
  

- I took her toothbrush decorum as a cue that sink contact was for cavemen, and seeing as we weren't going to be friends, this was my chance to make an impression.
- |
  

- When I say I tried I mean I gave it one shot, then watched with a smirk as it slumped onto the porcelain, like a toddler's fat bottom plunking down the final stair.
- |
  

- I doubt either of them consciously participated in the vanity version of RISK I had us playing, much less extracted character judgements from toothbrush, facecloth and razor peccadilloes.
- |
  

- "Were I to merit a sentence from any of the people I meet in Italy, it would most likely be: \"She's the girl who runs."
- Although running in Tropea remained an object lesson in curiosity, it was a kinder, gentler fish eye.
- |
  

- My first morning, I noticed a car slowing alongside me and battened down for the incoming.
- |
  

- "At least it was a chance to slot the inevitable preverbal proposition according the categories I had created: the Pinched Nerve, the Bicycle Pump, the Mother May I, the Firewalk, the Metronome, the Wounded Balloon, the Begnini."
- |
  

- With no sounds forthcoming I turned to look and saw a father directing his tiny daughter's attention to the freak on wheels.
- |
  

- She scrabbled to her knees on the passenger side, keening toward me, her eyes gulping with wonder.
- And I would laugh.
- |
  

- In Tropea, in fact, I may have evened the odds of being "the girl who laughed" with "the girl who ran.
- "\" At night, however, the laughter spilled on my bed &#8212; sounding as it does, in this strange country's random rooms off undetermined corridors, so impossibly like itself, like something I know to be true &#8212; spooks me."
- |
  

- I am compelled to open the balcony door to send it hydroplaning across the water to those I love.
- |
  

- Another dummy satellite.
- |
  

- I laugh even while considering that the various trajectories of my messages may lead not to another heart or even a knotted hub in time but merely to more of my own words, read and unread to be sure.
- Time began to pass with alacrity, and I dove through the days like a dolphin.
- |
  

- I was flush with the energy I had put into living as a hen in Reggio's foxhouse, and instead of leaping from corner to corner, landing always with my chin to my knees and eyes to the sky, I could plod to the beach lost in thought.
- |
  

- Or just lost.
- |
  

- It was located at the foot of 100 meters worth of stairs eked somewhat incidentally from a cliff.
- |
  

- The wide, beige belt of sand hosted an older crowd, mainly couples and a few amorphous, kicky-legged infants.
- |
  

- Even so, it took a while for my guard to literally drop.
- |
  

- "A book is woman's best friend in Reggio: a barrier when propped in front of her face, it eliminates all opportunities for eye contact."
- |
  

- Often I would move the page, instead of my eyes, from left to right to block a man's peripherally passing form.
- During my inaugural beach trip in Tropea, I tentatively turned my figurative shield into a more functional one, placing it over my face in response to the sun's perverse desire to brand only the rounds of cheek beneath my eyes.
- |
  

- In Scilla, this concession courted disaster, predators cleaving instantly to a woman holding her defenses so close as to be useless.
- |
  

- Thus gunshy, false alarms turned my pseudo-relaxing flop on the sand into something of a slapstick routine.
- |
  

- I would hear the telltale crunch of footsteps too close to my head and brace for an interruption.
- |
  

- Each time, however, I peeked from under my book and saw no one and nothing in either direction.
- |
  

- After four or five rounds I realized that the footsteps stopped the moment I lifted the book, and that they were not footsteps at all, but the scrape of my eyelashes, with each blink, across the page.
- "Once, on a lark, I engaged the television's \"on\" button with a flourish, keeping manual contact to a minimum out of superstition and, it must be said, intrinsic spastic tendencies. Even before the picture materialized, however, the super-charged chatter of MTV Europe startled me straight. Expedition aborted. Unfortunately, the TV was not foresaken for more productive pursuits: during the day I couldn't write a word and focused only on what was in front of me, like the loll-eyed beach babies. If my eyes accidentally passed over my notebook between 9 AM and 7 PM, sighing forlornly on the night table, I quickly looked away. When I had to move it, say, to make room for a glass or a nearly finished mouthwash bottle (anticipation killing me!), I prodded gingerly, as if not to wake it, sometimes using a pencil instead of my fingers. I didn't want to chance a bleary inquisition: \"When did  you  get in?"
- |
  

- Do you  know  what time it is?
- I had not spoken to my dad since Reggio, and wouldn't until we met in Florence.
- |
  

- When I told him I had found the village of his grandparents &#8212; on paper &#8212; he sounded off with typical skepticism, asking absently if I was really going to go there.
- |
  

- Of  course  I was going to go there!
- |
  

- Of course I was!
- |
  

- Yet here I was, still in Tropea, vigilantly guarding my serenity against the tyranny of inanimate objects.
- Each night, when I had thoroughly given train times, departure days, and route alternatives the what-for, I'd move on to the money I had left to spend, the items I could leave behind for the next, and most important, leg.
- |
  

- Though I have been obsessed with lightening my suitcase since arriving in Italy, I had been more successful at lightening myself.
- |
  

- My hair was braided with sun, my eyes a brighter, sugar snap green, my clothes balked from sharpened angles.
- |
  

- Yet the thought of one less T-shirt, shampoo bottle, or (newly targeted) dwindling stick of lip balm calmed me enormously.
- |
  

- Calmed me enough to confront the question of Figline Vegliaturo.
- |
  

- "To find: The City Hall."
- |
  

- A marriage license.
- |
  

- Our real name, perhaps on a tombstone.
- |
  

- Those were the things on the list, anyway.
