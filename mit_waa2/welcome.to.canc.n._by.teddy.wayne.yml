- All right, Spring Breakers, are you ready to  party ?
- |
  

- I said, are you ready to  party ?
- |
  

- What's that?
- |
  

- I can't hear you!
- "No, I'm serious\x97I lost 90 percent of my hearing in my left ear from a childhood accident (locker room, Q-tip) and am not sure if your cheering was suitably loud for the occasion."
- Just kidding!
- |
  

- Ha!
- |
  

- "That's what we call a little Canc\xFAn humor."
- |
  

- You'll get used it after a few days, just like you'll get used to the awkwardness of daylight encounters with the other college students you had drunken casual sex with the previous night.
- Wuzzup !
- |
  

- I said,  wuzzup !
- |
  

- That's better.
- |
  

- "Tonight at 10, just like every Wednesday at Se\xF1or Joey's, we've got a special treat for you, and it's gonna be all over the dance floor."
- |
  

- One word, four letters, starts with "f," the next letter is a vowel, and the last letter is a consonant.
- F-O-A-M !
- Bet you thought from my clues it was going to be an Anglo-Saxon word for fornication, huh?
- |
  

- But trust me, foam is even better than that other word, since while that other word  can  imply fornication, it can  also  be a curse uttered out of anger or disappointment.
- |
  

- Foam, on the other hand, always produces good feelings!
- |
  

- Unless it's in a glass of beer and you got cheated out of extra beer.
- |
  

- Not that our bartenders ever do that!
- |
  

- "They can't\x97we only serve bottles here."
- |
  

- But even if we served glasses, they still wouldn't.
- |
  

- Seriously.
- |
  

- Ha ha!
- "When the clock strikes 10\x97that's 22 to our fellow-Euro-trashers, ha, kidding again, Euro-partiers\x97this dance floor will be inundated with 50,000 cubic feet of medium-grade-density rainbow foam for your grinding pleasure while DJ Cuervo spins his magic."
- |
  

- And what happens in the foam  stays in the foam !
- "One quick amendment: Conventional rules and laws concerning sexual harassment still apply."
- |
  

- Ladies, if something untoward happens to you in the foam, you are permitted to convey that information to authorities outside of the foam.
- |
  

- Ohio State offensive line, we're looking in your direction.
- "Another amendment: As you may have read in our pamphlet, our dance floor contains 10,000 square feet of pounding techno and Euro-beat action."
- |
  

- Therefore, anyone with an elementary-school education should have picked up on the fact that 50,000 cubic feet means the foam will be 5 feet high.
- |
  

- So, people shorter than 5 feet are advised to leave.
- |
  

- Sorry, no refunds.
- "On that note, please: Do not eat the foam."
- |
  

- Friends may have told you that if you do so it will give you an awesome buzz, but they probably have not told you it contains a chemical that, when consumed in enough quantity, may cause appendicitis.
- |
  

- Fortunately, I got my appendix out, and can personally vouch that the foam does, indeed, give you a wicked buzz.
- |
  

- By remaining in the club until 9:59 p.m.
- |
  

- "Se\xF1or Joey's for medical treatment and expenses you may incur from the consumption of or exposure to the foam, including for any and all rashes and liver malfunctions."
- "At some point during the night, one of our hottie Mayan Mamas will dress as General Andr\xE9as Quintana Roo, for whom our lovely state is named, and perform atop a pedestal for three minutes the ancient ritualistic dance of the serpent for the serpent god, Culculcan, as depicted in codices."
- |
  

- When she has finished and properly expressed gratitude for Culculcan's healing and regenerative powers in absolute silence, a high-pitched siren will wail three times, indicating 3-for-1 mixed-drink specials for the next 15 minutes.
- |
  

- Note that shots count.
- That about covers it, you wild, crazy, freewheeling, irresponsible, problem-drinking, extravagantly-spending-Daddy's-money, about-to-be-infected-with-numerous-STDs jackasses!
- |
  

- Just kidding!
- |
  

- You guys are wicked awesome, and in no way do I resent having to cheerlead for you in this fashion that demeans my Mexican-history Ph.
- D.
- |
  

- I should be back in the States delivering a lecture on the Aztecs!
- |
  

- Let's just say some people make bad life choices, especially at internationally attended history conferences while under the influence, and they have to live with them!
- |
  

- "OK, DJ Cuervo's just kicked in the first phat jam, which means: Heads up, here comes the foam!"
- |
