- "In all the Beatles books I  have read, no author devotes more than a few paragraphs to its composition  and recording, whereas a disaster such as \"Revolution #9\" is worried over as  avidly as an ancient scroll.

- Yes, "Golden Slumbers" is pretty &#8212; almost everything Paul  McCartney wrote is pretty &#8212; but is that it?  Abbey Road  really only works when  you listen to it all at once. And yet here I am trying to make a case for  "She Came in through the Bathroom Window" as a great song, perhaps the  great song.
- Let us start again.

- "\"She Came in through the Bathroom Window,\""
- |
  

- "\"The  End,\""

- Abbey Road 's sparsely planted straight-up rockers &#8212; yet  another rebuke to John Lennon's famous mocking query to McCartney during the   White Album  sessions, when the latter was noodling around with slight  ditties such as "Honey Pie" and "Mother Nature's Son.
- "\" \""
- Don't you," Lennon  asked, "write rock'n'roll songs anymore?" At the time McCartney was  insulted &#8212; and, perhaps, affected &#8212; enough to turn around and write "Helter  Skelter," surely one of the hardest rocking songs ever written (and I say  that as a committed  Master of Puppets -era Metallica fan). "She Came in  through the Bathroom Window" reminds us that McCartney could rock as well as  any of the Beatles when he wished to; it reminds us, too, that McCartney was  the most multifarious and phenomenally gifted songwriter within a group  sporting a trio of musical divinities.
- With a few exceptions, Beatles lyrics are private-feeling but sternly  imprecise, a weird kind of impersonal directness they pioneered if not  invented.
- |
  

- That said, the sounds the words make in a Beatles song clearly  convey more than whatever higher sense a dictionary can cede them.
- |
  

- "\"She came  in through the bathroom window / Protected by a silver spoon ."
- |
  

- She said  she'd always been a dancer / She worked at fifteen clubs a day .
- |
  

- Sunday's  on the phone to Monday / Tuesday's on the phone to me.
- "\" Who is she?"
- |
  

- Bathroom  window?
- |
  

- Where?
- |
  

- Silver spoon?
- |
  

- Dancers?
- |
  

- Tuesday's on the what now?
- |
  

- No one  short of the fairie who sleeps amid the lobes of Paul McCarthey's cortex can  be expected to know what any of this means.
- |
  

- It is all very decadent, no  doubt.
- |
  

- But unlike, say, a poem, one does not really care to know what is  going on.
- |
  

- It is only rock'n'roll.
- McCartney wrote "She Came in through the Bathroom Window" long after the  point he and Lennon had stopped writing songs such as "Can't Buy Me Love"  and "Hard Day's Night" "eyeball to eyeball," as Lennon once put it. Though  they had moved away from each other personally and artistically, they were  not yet physically apart, and were still able to wring from their rivalrous  friendship a good deal of familiar inspiration.  Abbey Road  was recorded  after but released before the toxic &#8212; but very underrated &#8212;  Let It Be , which  by all accounts was created by musicians who could barely stand to speak to  one another. The songs on  Abbey Road  feel looser, lighter. The Beatles had  relaxed, and the music they made from that relaxation feels like an end, and  a calmly acknowledged end at that. After all, the album's proper final song  is called, rather pointedly, "The End.
- "\" \""
- She Came in through the Bathroom  Window" marks the moment where  Abbey Road  picks up after a druggy lull,  kicking in like an alarm clock and triggering the album's final sonic push.

- I mentioned that it rocks but it is also strikingly melodic &#8212; the Beatles  sound like bloody angels in the backing vocals.

- So it rocks, it is melodic,  but it also pounds, showcasing some of Ringo Starr's most assertive drumming, on snares that sound vaguely like  trash-can lids.
- |
  

- It rocks and is melodic and it pounds and is, structurally,  a cunningly complicated song.
- |
  

- It is also terrifyingly simple, with a basic  chord progression a paramecium could apprehend.

- "It is  The Great Gatsby  of  music: doing a myriad of amazing things incredibly quickly, and afterwards  one does not know where to begin to describe them."
- |
  

- It feels more momentous  than it was.

- It is like a brief earthquake that leaves everything standing  but nothing the same.
- "On the third volume of the cash-cow  Beatles Anthology  albums &#8212; which prove  that even the Beatles' filler is eight billion times more interesting than  just about anyone else's finished, polished music &#8212; the early draft of \"She  Came in through the Bathroom Window\" is revealed to be a slow, boggy thing  that runs twice as long as the final released version. It is an interesting  song the way  Trimalchio: An Early Version of the Great Gatsby , published in  2000, is an interesting book. One wonders how such a lapidary masterpiece  of tone and control was hewn from such an initially plain stone. At the end  of the take, McCartney &#8212; a man who, rather notoriously, cannot read  music &#8212; explains that the song needs some \"variation\" and knocks out some  groovy keyboarding while providing an imaginary choral accompaniment, which  he calls \"classical.\" Interestingly, none of these ideas survived as  McCartney imagined them &#8212; the groovy keyboarding became jangly guitars, the  crypto-classical choral backdrop became the Beatles' gorgeous oooo-ing and  ah-ing."

- Nothing was "produced" in that Phil Spectorish way that very nearly  mortally wounds  Let It Be . McCartney seems to have intuitively worked out  the best way to serve his merely good song and in doing so made it a great  song. This reminds us that great ideas are rarely Great Ideas. Great Ideas  are huge, ugly, top-down things (and McCartney has written a number of  them). However, great ideas are small, beautiful, and best nourished in  the idiosyncratic soil of a single mind.  Tender is the Night  is a Great  Idea, but  The Great Gatsby  is a great idea. "She Came in through the  Bathroom Window" is a great idea on an album thick with great ideas; a song,  it seems to me, that can be heard and loved in the pure, agendaless way one  loves music and writing before one develops that thing called "taste." "She  Came in through the Bathroom Window" is the best song on the finest album by  the greatest group of all time, a song that in a little under two minutes  establishes for once and all that rock'n'roll is, above all else, supposed  to be fun.

  It may be the best song on the finest album by the greatest rock group of 
  all time. Does this that make it the best song of all time? Unlikely, as 
  it is usually not corralled among the great, classic rock'n'roll songs. It 
  does not even place very highly in the heats through which Fab Four fanatics 
  typically run their pet tunes in search of the one Beatles song to rule them 
  all. I have never even heard it on the radio. In all the Beatles books I 
  have read, no author devotes more than a few paragraphs to its composition 
  and recording, whereas a disaster such as "Revolution #9" is worried over as 
  avidly as an ancient scroll. About all one can say authoritatively is this: 
  "She Came in through the Bathroom Window" is cut 13 on  Abbey Road ; in it, 
  one can hear a tambourine; and it clocks in at just a little over 1:57.
  The finishing panel of a truly odd triptych &#8212; "Mean Mr Mustard," "Polythene 
  Pam," and itself &#8212; "She Came in through the Bathroom Window" feels 
  unnaturally welded onto the songs that precede it. "Mustard" and "Pam" are 
  two of the dispatches an increasingly gnomic John Lennon saw fit to transmit 
  to earth from planet Heroin; by all evidence, he did not care to finish 
  either song, which do not end so much as simply collide into the next track. 
  In this way the placement of "She Came in through the Bathroom Window" 
  initially comes off as a last resort: "Where would you have us stick this 
  little two-minute jobby, Paul?" That it works as well as it does is 
  remarkable. But then we are discussing the second half of  Abbey Road , quite 
  possibly the best, most genre- and mood-busting twenty-two and a half 
  minutes of rock music ever recorded. Each track is awesome &#8212; even "Mean Mr 
  Mustard" and "Polythene Pam" in their own weird way &#8212; because the whole they 
  form is awesome. The conundrum is arguing this on the merits of each

  McCartney wrote is pretty &#8212; but is that it?  Abbey Road  really only works when

  "She Came in through the Bathroom Window" as a great song, perhaps the 
  great song.
  Let us start again. "She Came in through the Bathroom Window," like "The 
  End," is one of  Abbey Road 's sparsely planted straight-up rockers &#8212; yet 
  another rebuke to John Lennon's famous mocking query to McCartney during the 
   White Album  sessions, when the latter was noodling around with slight 
  ditties such as "Honey Pie" and "Mother Nature's Son." "Don't you," Lennon 
  asked, "write rock'n'roll songs anymore?" At the time McCartney was

  in through the bathroom window / Protected by a silver spoon ... She said 
  she'd always been a dancer / She worked at fifteen clubs a day ... Sunday's 
  on the phone to Monday / Tuesday's on the phone to me." Who is she? Bathroom 
  window? Where? Silver spoon? Dancers? Tuesday's on the what now? No one
