- Stan Conley
- A Marshville basher.

- Uses the phrase "hick town" a lot, but not in the friendly, self-deprecating way the rest of us do. Either work on your sarcasm, Stan, or get the hell out. No one's forcing you to live here.

- Bob Hendricks
- On 9/11, while a lot of us were watching the TV in Harvey's Bar, Bob remarked that he went to New York City once, as a kid.
- |
  

- Everyone was paying too much attention to the TV to hear him, and he shut his mouth quick when he realized what he said.
- |
  

- But I heard him.
- |
  

- And I haven't forgotten.
- |
  

- Andy Shaw
- Went to the community college over in Springdale for a semester and a half before flunking out and taking a job at the hardware store.
- |
  

- Probably considers himself one of the cultural elite.

- Christopher Redding
- Gets mad when people call him Chris.

- Frank Anderson
- "FRANK: Hey, do you mind if I borrow your shovel?"
- "ME: Help yourself."
- |
  

- It's in the garage.
- "FRANK: Thanks."
- Frank has not returned this shovel, and this shovel is a good shovel and I want it in my garage.

- Burt Summers
- Quit playing bocce; said the shoes hurt his shins.
- |
  

- He could still come to the court and cheer us on, but instead he stays home and reads.

- Books!

- Mike Morgan
- Too close for comfort.

  A Marshville basher. Uses the phrase "hick town" a lot, but not in the friendly, self-deprecating way the rest of us do. Either work on your sarcasm, Stan, or get the hell out. No one's forcing you to live here.
