  4. Pest control.
  When dealing with the worst kind of pest, chocolate is really the only appropriate Bundt cake option. It will take some time for you to decide on this as a last resort. First, notice that your hydrangeas have been uprooted. Put out traps for gophers, to no avail.

  6. A pain-free crown of thorns.
  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees. (Note: Though you may be tempted to make a moist yellow cake, do not do so. Angel food is required.) Blend flour, butter, eggs, sugar, baking powder. Do not forget the vanilla. Do not forget to grease Bundt pan. Do not forget how much you have suffered, day in and day out, waxing floors and folding fitted sheets to perfection, unappreciated by anyone save the cat. Stab toothpicks in cake to determine readiness.
  Once cake is done, cool on a wire rack. On a clean table or countertop, prepare other ingredients. Lay out one small rubber trash basket, one can gold spray paint, two feet of barbed wire, one roll of bendable copper wire. Place barbed wire inside trash basket to avoid getting paint on your furniture. Holding paint can at a slight angle, aim paint inside trash basket and thoroughly coat barbed wire with paint. (Note: Do this in a well-ventilated area if you do not wish to see visions. If you do wish to see visions, do this in a small, cramped closet).
  As you wait for the barbed wire to dry, test cake for coolness. Put cooled cake inside trash basket, and repeat spray paint instructions. Wait for cake to dry. Sit on floor with your back pressed against the rose geranium wallpaper. Talk to the cat. When both barbed wire and cake are dry, take a moment to enjoy the beautiful gilded art you have created. See it shine. Feel almost weepy at its splendid beauty. Next, coil barbed wire carefully around the cake. You should be able to wrap the barbed wire around the top of the cake three times. When you have achieved a perfect circular shape, carefully bind it with the copper wire and firmly press wire into cake. Check to see that wire is firmly planted.
  Once you are certain the wire will not move, place bottom of cake on your head. Admire yourself in the mirror. You may wish to apply Vaseline to your eyelids for a discreet glow. You may wish to wear a flowing white gown or bathrobe. Experiment with lighting. (Note: When wearing her own Bundt cake, Martha prefers dramatic backlighting.) Open the door and greet your husband and children as they walk up the polished slate stone footpath. Stretch out your arms and gaze heavenward. Do not react to their surprised murmurs. You are not distracted by the troubles of this world.
