- "\"Hello."
- |
  

- I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has not accepted Joe the Plumber's friend request on Facebook.
- |
  

- We know he's logged on, because we saw he changed his status on Monday.
- |
  

- On Tuesday, he joined the group Art Historians Are Saucy.
- |
  

- But he still won't accept Joe the Plumber's friend request.
- |
  

- He knows it's Joe.
- |
  

- Joe uses the screen shot of the two of them together as his profile picture.
- |
  

- That's not a uniter.
- |
  

- That's the same old liberal-elite politics as usual.
- |
  

- "\"Hello."
- |
  

- I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama talks during movies.
- |
  

- During a recent screening of  The Dark Knight , Barack Obama irritated several pro-America patrons when he echoed the famous 'Why so serious?
- |
  

- Michelle, who hasn't always been proud of being an American, much like the Joker.
- |
  

- He'll raise his voice over Heath Ledger's.
- |
  

- And he'll raise your taxes.
- |
  

- That's why I'm so serious, my friends, about your vote on November 4."
- |
  

- "\"Hello."
- |
  

- I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama doesn't use his turn signal when he merges onto a freeway.
- |
  

- I mean, seriously, who the hell does this guy think he is?
- |
  

- He just goes.
- |
  

- It's not even like he attempts to fit in.
- |
  

- And I'm not talking lone-wolf maverick style, either.
- |
  

- I mean, this is the kind of driving that gets people killed.
- |
  

- Much like the bombs of Bill Ayers that could have killed countless Americans.
- |
  

- That's not change, my friends.
- |
  

- That's the same old Washington politics as usual.
- |
  

- "\"Hello."
- |
  

- "I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama always Super-Sizes at McDonald's but then orders\x97get this\x97a Diet Coke."
- |
  

- Who do you think you're kidding, Barack?
- |
  

- Cutting calories in one part of your meal doesn't cut the calories for all of it.
- |
  

- Just like your tax plan.
- |
  

- Washington's spending has gotten obese with earmarks, and one Diet Coke isn't going to fix it.
- |
  

- Barack the wealth spender is washing down his Big Macs with some 'pinko' Kool-Aid.
- |
  

- Not the leader America needs.
- |
  

- "\"Hello."
- |
  

- I'm calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama won't stop repeating those stupid Chuck Norris facts.
- |
  

- For example, before the third debate, Barack opened a bag of Lay's potato chips.
- |
  

- My friends, I knew what was coming.
- |
  

- I've been tested.
- |
  

- It was either a Chuck Norris joke or a  Seinfeld  double dip.
- |
  

- John McCain gets it.
- |
  

- Chuck Norris can only eat one.
- |
  

- But don't be fooled.
- |
  

- Barack Obama was just pandering to the Florida vote.
- |
  

- But you need to know that Barack Obama was for the cancellation of  Walker, Texas Ranger  before he was against it.
- |
  

- And he also hates  Everybody Loves Raymond .
- |
  

- That's not reaching across the aisle.
- |
  

- That's changing the channel on small-town American values.
- |
  

- Not on John McCain's dial.
