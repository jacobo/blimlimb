- Dear Niall,
- You are lovely.
- |
  

- Welcome to the family.
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- Ann is very mentally ill.
- |
  

- She is under heavy medication for her dissociative personality disorder, commonly referred to as multiple personality disorder.
- |
  

- She is unaware she suffers from this.
- |
  

- She thinks the drugs she takes are vitamins.
- |
  

- Please make sure she takes them every morning.
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- Ann is not allergic to horses.
- |
  

- We told her that because she kept bugging us for a pony when she was a kid.
- |
  

- "Please don't tell her we lied to her\x97she'd be crushed."
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- We've never told Ann there is no Santa.
- |
  

- Please play along and take her to Santa's Grotto at the mall to have her picture done, and I'll reimburse you for the photo.
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- When Ann was 14 she didn't go to a summer camp.
- |
  

- She went to a special camp for heavy children.
- |
  

- She never noticed, and we never told her.
- |
  

- Her feelings are very delicate.
- |
  

- Please don't point out to her what the name Camp Tubby implies.
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- Ann's childhood pet, Rocky, does not live on a ranch near Ocala.
- |
  

- He choked to death on a chicken bone she fed to him at a family picnic.
- |
  

- Please do not tell her the truth.
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- The cards Ann receives at Christmas from her childhood friends are actually written by me and her Aunt Beatrice.
- |
  

- She didn't have any friends, outside of her imaginary friends.
- |
  

- We told her when she started seventh grade that they all moved to a large house just outside Ocala, and they've written her Christmas cards since then.
- |
  

- Dear Niall,
- I may be a woman of small stature who lives in a retirement community, but if you hurt my daughter, my entire bowling team will see that you suffer.
