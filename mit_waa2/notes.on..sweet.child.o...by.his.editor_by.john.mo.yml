- "\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\""

- Delivered to Axl Rose

- His Editor.
- |
  

- Hi, Axl,
- Just got your manuscript and demo for the song "Sweet Child O' ( sic ) Mine.
- "\" I think we need to talk."
- |
  

- As your editor, I am responsible for making your songs as cogent as possible, for helping them reach the high editorial standards your public has come to expect.
- |
  

- With this one, I am certainly earning my keep.
- |
  

- After several attempts to reach you by phone, I am sending along my notes.
- |
  

- Please make appropriate fixes as soon as possible, at which point I can send them to copyediting and proofreading in time for your upcoming studio session.
- "She's got a smile that, it seems to me \x97Why equivocate?"
- |
  

- You weaken your point by framing this as a mere personal observation instead of a fact.
- "Reminds me of childhood memories \x97Redundant."
- |
  

- You either have a memory or you're reminded of something.
- |
  

- You're not reminded of a memory.
- |
  

- Heavy-metal fans won't stand for such writing, my friend.
- "Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky \x97I asked around the office and no one is sure a blue sky is \"fresh."
- "\" You could have a blue sky at the end of a long, sweaty day and there would be nothing fresh about it."
- |
  

- And she reminds you of a time when things were fresh?
- |
  

- Fond reminiscences of freshness are no foundation for love.
- |
  

- Fix.
- "Now and then when I see her face it takes me away to that special place \x97Again, you're weakening your own argument."
- |
  

- Why does the sight of her face transport you only periodically?
- |
  

- And is it just her smile or her entire face that does this to you?
- |
  

- Because you've already said both.
- |
  

- Consistency, Axl!
- "And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry \x97Why would you do that?"
- |
  

- Because you miss the freshness you described earlier?
- |
  

- I think the whole "fresh" thing is really tripping you up. Also, crying? Wimpy.
- OK, on to the second verse.
- "She's got eyes of the bluest skies \x97See, this is just getting worse."
- |
  

- Now her eyes are made of sky?
- |
  

- Nice imagery, but you just got done saying her smile reminded you of memories of sky.
- |
  

- Is this verse actually supposed to be a second draft of the first verse?
- |
  

- Am I just confused on formatting?
- |
  

- Help!
- "As if they thought of rain \x97Axl, eyes can't think of rain."
- |
  

- And even if they could, which they can't, why would bluest skies think of rain?
- |
  

- Perhaps less imagery of thinking eyes made of sky and more direct exploration of your feelings?
- "I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain \x97Well, hell."
- |
  

- I guess in your special Axl World anything is possible.
- |
  

- Eyes can be made of sky, ponder the weather, and exhibit pain in amounts that can be weighed.
- "Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place where as a child I'd hide \x97Delete."
- |
  

- Fix.
- |
  

- Do something.
- |
  

- You'd hide in a place that reminded you of hair?
- |
  

- Never show me such phrases again.
- "And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by \x97Whew."
- |
  

- "OK, listen to me now: Thunder can't quietly do anything."
- |
  

- It's thunder.
- |
  

- And, more importantly, do you really want to come across as a wuss who's constantly on the verge of weeping and skittering into hair caves to escape from rain?
- |
  

- Is this a song about love or climatic anxiety?
- |
  

- You need to work these things out.
- Finally, Axl, I think we might have had a misunderstanding regarding my previous notes.
- |
  

- When I wrote in colored pencil "Where do we go now?
- "\" I wasn't offering that as a lyric."
- |
  

- I was simply observing that, in narrative terms, the song needed to progress in some way.
- |
  

- You love the girl, she's helping you work through some issues, whatever.
- |
  

- So where do we go  now ?
- |
  

- But instead of providing a satisfactory conclusion, you simply took my note and repeated it over and over again before ultimately just stating the title of the song.
- |
  

- This is unacceptable.
- |
  

- Don't ask us, the listeners, where we go.
- |
  

- That's up to you as the writer!
- |
  

- Tell us  where we go now!
- Again, let's try to fix these things soon and get "Sweet Child of Mine" ("My Sweet Child"?
- |
  

- Because, frankly, if it should ever hit the street in its current form, the song would be a colossal failure.
- Talk soon!

  Hi, Axl,\n\
  Just got your manuscript and demo for the song \"Sweet Child O' ( sic ) Mine.\" I think we need to talk. As your editor, I am responsible for making your songs as cogent as possible, for helping them reach the high editorial standards your public has come to expect.
