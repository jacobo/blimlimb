- As anyone who has stood in front of a high-speed fan while someone dumped a bucket of manure into the blades can tell you, shit sticks.
- In observing the 2008 campaign, I've noticed there's a certain staleness to the current crop of negative advertisements.

- Hillary Clinton recently recycled Walter Mondale's 1984 "Red Phone" ad in order to imply that Barack Obama's a heavy sleeper who might let a crisis call go to voicemail. So, as a public, nonpartisan service, I'll be creating a series of ready-to-produce scripts for negative political advertising that seek to freshen up the genre.
- For illustration purposes, I'll be using a hypothetical opponent with a nondescript name, Herman Q. Asscrack.

- Haven't you grabbed enough of my money with your tax-and-spend votes in Congress already?

- At least use our hard-earned money to pay off the national debt or strengthen our military readiness!

- The entire background remains frozen.

- "CANDIDATE: ( Oozing gravitas."

- Unlike my opponent, I've pledged not to use your tax dollars to build giant golden statues of myself.

- CANDIDATE  turns to address the camera.
