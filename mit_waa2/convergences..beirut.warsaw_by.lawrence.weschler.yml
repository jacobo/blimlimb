  What to make of this disconcerting juxtaposition, last week's cover of  Time  magazine, laying bare the agony of Beirut under Israeli bombardment, up against the poster for Roman Polanski's film account of the improbable survival of a Warsaw Jew in an earlier city and country laid waste, in that case by the Nazis?\n\

  Of course, though, these two particular twinned images raise a more disquieting echo as well. For how is it, one can't help but wonder, that, given their own recent history (of all histories!), the Jews of Israel don't simply recoil at the sense of themselves as furies raining unbridled destruction down on distant cities packed to the gills with panic-stricken civilian refugees, or, conversely, how is it that they (of all people!) can't seem to empathize with the aching situation of a neighboring people crammed into sweltering and hopeless ghettos ... etc. etc. etc.\n\
  I am by no means the first to marvel, somewhat despairingly, along such lines. Nor is the Middle East, cursed as it is, the only place where such sorts of painful conjunctions have played themselves out. One need only think of the Athenians and their seemingly outclassed polis, heroic victors nevertheless over the Persian Empire at Marathon and then again at Salamis (as celebrated in Herodotus's thrilling accounts), who within a few generations, toward the end of the Peloponnesian War (as Thucydides relates, with conspicuous allusions to Herodotus), had turned themselves into a mighty empire, hellbent on conquest, lashing themselves into the presently catastrophic campaign against tiny, seemingly outclassed Syracuse.
