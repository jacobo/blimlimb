- |
  

- Nurse weighed me.
- |
  

- I gained again.

- Then led me to the examination room and shut the door.
- |
  

- For some reason, she did not say, "Let's see if I can help with your erectile dysfunction.

- I'm sorry, you must have the wrong chart.
- "\" And she therefore didn't have the opportunity to toss the chart aside, remove her glasses, let down her hair, and say, \""
- Well, let's not worry about the chart," before locking the door and telling me to slide out of my clothes.
- Needless to say, I'm very disappointed.
- |
  

- Doctor did explain that hemorrhoid is too small to rubber-band and warned that cutting it out risks leakage for life.
- |
  

- He prescribed Proctosol.
- |
  

- It works like a charm.
- March 4, 2007
- Terry from butcher shop called!
- |
  

- Turns out he's just shy.
- |
  

- Doing dinner this week, though he was adamant about no steakhouses.
- March 12, 2007
- Cops showed up at my house after nosy neighbors complained about the large piles of citrus-smelling, glued-together squid all over my front lawn.
- |
  

- "\"Where are the female officers?"
- |
  

- I want to be frisked by female officers!
- "\" I yelled as I was hauled away for no reason."
