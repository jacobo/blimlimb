  (Busy music and a kaleidoscope of colorful graphics, which ultimately
  part to reveal an ecstatic audience consisting largely of middle-aged
  women, with some middle-aged men and college students thrown in.)
  HOST
  (standing in the audience, holding a fuzzy-headed, slightly oversized
  microphone)
  Hello, and welcome back to our show. Our topic today is: "People Who
  Enjoy Being Verbally Abused By Talk-Show Audiences."  Now, before we
  went
  to the break, we were talking to Steve.
  (CUT TO: Steve. He is around 35, about 40 pounds overweight, and wearing
  
  an unflattering sweater.)
  HOST
  Now, Steve: Since you were a teenager, you've fantasized about being
  told
  off by a sassy woman holding a microphone. Is that right?
  STEVE
  (ashamed)
  Yes. That's right. It's ruined many of my relationships: I can't relate
  to women unless they have a microphone in their hand and are making
  disparaging comments about me, preferably in front of a large crowd.
  Some
  women tried to accommodate me for a while -- we'd attend open-mike
  nights,
  high-school football games, companies' annual meetings -- any place
  where
  there was an audience and a mike, but after a while, none of them would
  be able to take it anymore.
  HOST
  Well, we have someone here who wants to comment on that.
  SASSY LADY
  Yeah, I just wanted to say that you're sick. (Audience cheers.) What
  kind
  of a man does that to a woman? You need to get yourself some help.
  HOST
  Steve?
  STEVE
  (Looks pleased. Then ashamed. Then pleased.)
  HOST
  We have someone else here who'd like to make a comment. Yes, sir?
  AUTHORIAL VOICE
  Yeah, I think that this is pretty much a one-joke story.
  HOST
  True enough.
  AUTHORIAL VOICE
  So, you know, perhaps it could end now.
  HOST
  Seems fair enough to me.
  (STEVE, HOST, SASSY LADY begin filing toward the exits of the studio,
  along with the rest of the audience.)
  AUTHORIAL VOICE
  You know, we don't all have to get up and leave. The illusion that any
  of
  us actually exist -- which was pretty shaky to begin with -- has by now
  been fairly well destroyed. The story can now just end abruptly at any
  moment.
  HOST
  True enough. It could just end, cutting either one of us off in mid sent
  --
  --ence.
  AUTHORIAL VOICE
  Hm. That's odd. I thought it was going to end just then.
  HOST
  Yeah. Me too.
  (They stand together, uncomfortably, awaiting the end of the story. A
  few
  minutes pass. Then centuries pass. Then a few more minutes. They turn
  into marvelous fire-breathing dragons, then into baby chicks. They turn
  one another inside out. They invent time travel, and prevent the
