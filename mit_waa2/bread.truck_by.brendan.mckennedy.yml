- We started to notice that every time we left the Steak 'n' Shake on Old Fort Parkway, the same truck was driving by.
- |
  

- It was a "Bunny Bread" truck. Painted on the side was the head of a bunny rabbit, blue and yellow. The bunny was saying, "Be funny!
- |
  

- Eat Bunny!
- "\" The bunny really liked his little rhyme, smiling a crazed blue and yellow bunny smile."
- No matter what time we left - midnight, one a.m.
- |
  

- Bunny Bread was getting delivered right ahead of us.
- |
  

- I've never seen Bunny Bread in a store.
- |
  

- I got the idea to follow the truck, to see where all this Bunny Bread was getting delivered, but it was never the right time.
- It might have been bound for Knoxville, and I wasn't prepared to drive that far.
- One night we got on the road right behind the Bunny Bread truck and followed it a mile or so to the intersection with Murfreesboro Road.
- |
  

- We got stopped along the truck's right side at the traffic signal.
- |
  

- The blue and yellow rabbit looked right down into our car.
- |
  

- "\"Be funny!"
- |
  

- Eat Bunny!
- "\" it said."
- I wondered if the driver noticed us like we noticed him.
- |
  

- I wondered if he thought it was strange that he was always delivering Bunny Bread when we were leaving the Steak 'n' Shake.
- Then another Bunny Bread truck pulled up to the turn lane on Murfreesboro Road, perpendicular on our right-hand side.
- |
  

- There was no one else on the road.
- |
  

- Just two Bunny Bread trucks and, in between, our little Ford Escort, all waiting for the traffic lights to change.
- The Bunny Bread trucks flashed their high-beams at each other.
- I felt like the witness to a strange conspiracy.
- Their blue and yellow bunnies told each other to be funny and eat bunny.
- |
  

- They were like two children waiting for a prank to ripen, acknowledging the guilt between them with conspicuous blue and yellow grins.
- |
  

- The teacher opens his thermos and it is filled with worms.
- My life is full of such vague oddities, like a thermos filled with worms.
- |
  

- My life is full of blue and yellow bunnies.
