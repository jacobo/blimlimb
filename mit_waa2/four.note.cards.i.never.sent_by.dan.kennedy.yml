- Congratulations on the new arrival.
- |
  

- "Just wait until you get to the point I'm at: I basically wake up, pour myself a drink, go out to the patio, light a cigarette, and try to figure out which kids in the pool are mine and from what marriage."

- On a good day, I remember not to jump in with my smokes in my pocket.
- |
  

- It was great seeing you when we were in town.
- |
  

- When we got home we followed your lead and made friends with a black woman from the condo right across from ours and now we're the multi-cultural toast of Vista Del Sol.
- |
  

- We're also meditating and we've enrolled in a Thai cooking class.
- |
  

- Keep it real, you guys.
- |
  

- See you again soon.
- |
  

- Congratulations on the promotion.
- |
  

- That's got to be a sweet feeling.
- |
  

- Fat checks, cognac, and imported cigarettes at eleven in the morning.
- |
  

- Never mind all the sweet ladies lounging around your houses asking you for a little breakfast money and maybe cab fare home.
- |
  

- You cross date lines hung over and never know what time it is.
- |
  

- Oh, man, I want to get a little piece of what you have.
- |
  

- I don't know if I deserve it, but I want it so bad I can taste it.
- |
  

- Let me know if you quit.
- |
  

- Congratulations on tying the knot.
- |
  

- You two are both incredible people and I can't imagine two better.
- |
  

- I don't know if I'm saying this right.
- |
  

- I think you're both hot.
- |
  

- I mean, I'm not gay or anything.
- |
  

- I DIG BOTH OF YOU.
- |
  

- God, I don't know, maybe I'm bisexual?
- |
  

- I never really thought about it.
- |
  

- I'm not sure what this all means for the three of us, but, you guys, I want you to know it's from my heart.
- |
  

- Okay.
- |
  

- Congratulations and best of luck.

  Congratulations on the new arrival...
  Just wait until you get to the point I'm at: I basically wake up, pour myself a drink, go out to the patio, light a cigarette, and try to figure out which kids in the pool are mine and from what marriage. On a good day, I remember not to jump in with my smokes in my pocket.

  You two are both incredible people and I can't imagine two better... well... better-looking people when it comes down to it. I don't know if I'm saying this right... but I think you're both hot. I mean, I'm not gay or anything... but it's like I DIG BOTH OF YOU. God, I don't know, maybe I'm bisexual? I never really thought about it. I'm not sure what this all means for the three of us, but, you guys, I want you to know it's from my heart. Okay... anyway. Congratulations and best of luck.
