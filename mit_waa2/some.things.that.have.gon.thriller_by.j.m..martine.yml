- I also have yet to name, so he is understandably upset, RLR is, and is about to storm into a bunker full of nutso homicidal soldiers, his eyes red with rage, loaded up to here with guns and, I don't know, grenades and stuff, and a little man in a red suit pops in out of the forest.

  I've written 1,500 pages, most of them dealing with
  Rick L. Ruffian's (RLR) past and also some interwoven
  backstory about his arch-nemesis, whose name&nbsp;&#151; for
  purposes of this draft&nbsp;&#151; is Arch-Nemesis (AN). AN's
  name will of course be changed when I come up with an
  actual Eastern European name. There is also some
  exciting stuff involving a submarine, a B-52 bomber,
  and a hot-air air balloon (150 pp).
  It has been tremendous, writing this thing. But some
  things have gone wrong.
  Like you have RLR fighting as a teenager in the Korean
  war (because he is so eager to fight for his country
  that he will forge his birth certificate, which he can
  only do by going to Chinatown and learning forgery
  from an ancient master, who teaches him Kung Fu in the
  bargain, so not only does he learn how to forge but he
  also learns how to kick ass, and how cool is that? (78
  1/2 pages))&nbsp;&#151; so like he's in the middle of the war
  and he has just lost his best friend, who, I also have
  yet to name, so he is understandably upset, RLR is,
  and is about to storm into a bunker full of nutso
  homicidal soldiers, his eyes red with rage, loaded up
  to here with guns and, I don't know, grenades and
  stuff, and a little man in a red suit pops in out of
  the forest.
  So you can understand RLR's confusion. Because what is
  this short man doing in a forest? He's dancing! And
  he's holding an object of seemingly great importance,
  though it's like impossible to tell what it is. And
  they have a conversation about chewing gum (10 pages)
  and the little man, before vanishing into the depths
  of the forest, he imparts some kind of secret wisdom
  to RLR by whispering in his ear, after which RLR
  proceeds to kick ass.
  Potential Problems: The short man&nbsp;&#151; what is he
  doing in the novel? Why did I not introduce him
  earlier, at the carnival in Grenada? What  kind  of
  chewing gum?
  Also, RLR spends some months on an abandoned oil
  tanker near Greenland and develops an almost erotic
  relationship with a killer whale. It's not like they
  fool around. But I wrote some pretty suggestive
  passages ("The long smooth body of the beast dipped up
  and down in the Artic waters. Up and down. Up up up,
  then down. Ruffian thought about taking his clothes
  off.") and I do give some overly lascivious
  descriptions of Orca mating rituals (130 pp).
  Potential Problems: Reader's reaction. Specifically:
  PETA, Brigitte Bardot.
  And there is also a duel with AN when they are in
  their early teens. But they accidentally shoot a pair
  of bluebirds&nbsp;&#151;  RLR's bullet hits the father bluebird
  and AN's the mother bluebird&nbsp;&#151; so AN and RLR have to
  raise the nest of hatchlings themselves, and some
  comical stuff ensues  (94 pp) because they still want
  to kill each other and have their guns ready all
  throughout, but they have to take care of the
  hatchlings or they'll die, right? So they go to a pet
  store to buy bird seed while still technically
  involved in the duel, and they like go through all
  this Odd Couple stuff packing heat.
  Potential Problems: Is AN really the nurturing type?
  Will the reader "buy it"? What do bluebirds eat,
  anyway? Worms? Also: PETA. And Tony Randall.
  Yes: some revisions need to be made . But I am hopeful
  as to the resolution, which I am outlining right now,
  which is that RLR and AN face off in this facility
  that manufactures ICBMs, and it's in some small
  Eastern European country, which is where AN is from,
  right? And so he (RLR) mentions something about some
  stereotypical Russian item (Borscht? Vodka?), as in
  "I'm going to shove this Russian Item up your criminal
  ass," and AN says, "Dude, that's pretty culturally
  insensitive [not that AN would say Dude&nbsp;&#151; but that's
  the general vibe]&nbsp;&#151; we don't even eat/drink that
  here, in this small Eastern European country with its
  rich history and, you know, culture."  It goes on from
  there.
  PPs: Do small Eastern European contries really have
  rich histories/cultures? Also: What about S.A.L.T.?
  Plus: The sword-fighting scene on the very tip of the
  ICBM&nbsp;&#151; too phallic? What happened to the baby
  bluebirds?
  I am also writing a Romance novel, though it seems to
  want to turn into a Time Travel adventure involving
  action film director Tony Scott, and also another
  killer whale. The name of the killer whale is Jenny.
  So far I've got 2,300 pages.
