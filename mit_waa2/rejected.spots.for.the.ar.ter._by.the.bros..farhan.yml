- It takes some tact, as people don't like to give out their personal info.

- She throws the  YOUNG WOMAN  a stethoscope.

- "VET: Now remember, people's animals are like members of their family."
- |
  

- So it's important that we stress to them the gentle methods and safety precautions we employ while the pets are here in our supervision.
- |
  

- Know what I mean?
- |
  

- Cut to the same  YOUNG WOMAN  at Abu Ghraib, smashing a prisoner in the face with the butt of her rifle, hogtying naked prisoners, posing in front of a naked dogpile of blindfolded prisoners with a "thumbs up" as a cigarette dangles from her lower lip. Cut back to the  VET 's office, where the  YOUNG WOMAN  responds. )
- "YOUNG WOMAN: Yes, ma'am."

- Can we offer you a Diet Dr. Pepper or some nacho-cheese combos?

- No? Very good, then.
- |
  

- Right this way.
- |
  

- So listen, there are times when it can be very exciting around here.
- |
  

- A 400-pound cement gargoyle jumps at our applicant, but is restrained by a chain attached to the wall.
- |
  

- DR.
- |
  

- "SPENGLER: See what I mean?"
- |
  

- Anyhow, most people think the ghost-busting business has been down since the late '80s.
- |
  

- Not true.
- |
  

- They may not come in the form of hell-bent 10-story-tall marshmallows anymore, but take my word for it, there are still plenty of ghosts out there in need of a good busting, especially in season.
- |
  

- Needless to say, I'm not afraid of any of 'em .
- |
  

- DR.
- |
  

- SPENGLER  chuckles, but his joke falls on deaf ears.
- |
  

- The two share an awkward pause.
- |
  

- DR.
- |
  

- "SPENGLER: But seriously, at times, when you head out to the site, you got your proton gun all charged up and set on \"Annihilate,\" but there are just no good-natured ghosts or endearing poltergeists to be found. You're going to want to fire that sucker, believe me, but you have to show restraint. It can be a bit of a cock tease\x97you know what I'm saying?"
- |
  

- Cut to footage of our applicant holding a U.S.
- |
  

- Army M21 assault rifle in an Iraqi warehouse full of harmless farm equipment, an old beat-up foosball table missing a yellow goalie, and, most notably, no weapons of mass destruction or weapon-producing agents.
- |
  

- The  COLONEL  scratches his head in confusion, then helplessly resurveys the room to no avail.
- |
  

- Cut back to Ghostbusters home office, where the young man responds.
- |
  

- "COLONEL KICK ASS: Believe me, Dr. Spengler, I know the feeling."
- |
  

- Just out of curiosity, what kind of name is Egon?
