- JEFF AND AUDREY CRENSHAW are tickled BLOOD RED over the birth of their daughter, PENNY.

- After an initial meeting between Jeff (guitar, vo-killz) and AUDREY (reference librarian, hobbyist cook) and several years LIVING IN BLACKEST SIN followed by GODLESS, NONSECULAR MARRIAGE, a decision was made to INTENSIFY THE MAYHEM by producing SCREAMING, POSSIBLY COLICKY OFFSPRING.

- Jeff's SPASTIC AND THRASHING COITAL ASSAULT around Christmas of 2004 was a GORE-IFIC success, and, shortly thereafter, BLOOD, SINEW, AND BONE began to form in Audrey's HOPELESSLY FERTILE WOMB.

- Audrey's BRUTAL AND TORTUROUS labor lasted a HELLISH 18 hours and produced INHUMAN, ATONAL, ANIMAL-LIKE HOWLS OF ANGUISHED PAIN.

- The PIERCED FLESH OF HER BACK BLED slightly as THE NEEDLE DUG INTO HER SPINE, delivering her epidural, lessening the DEMONIC BLITZKRIEG OF VENOMOUS, PRIMAL LABOR PAIN.

- With a SICKENING, BONE-SEPARATING POP, Penny's GLISTENING GREEN AND BLOOD-SPATTERED head was finally visible as her ONSLAUGHT OF BLISTERINGLY LOUD, AGONIZED SHRIEKS filled the delivery room sometime in the WITCHING HOURS of September 16, 2005.

- At birth, Penny was a KRUSHING 8 pounds, 11 ounces, and 21 inches of WRITHING FLESH.

- Thanks to all who brought casseroles, love, and support.
