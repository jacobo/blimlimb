- Others appreciate how your inappropriate comments give them a feeling of solidarity with one another.
- People who do not know you well sometimes consider you "aloof" until they realize you are simply boring.

- But when you broke the lid of that ceramic thing at Pottery Barn last week and just walked away, the guy working there totally saw you.
- You have an optimistic "glass-half-filled" outlook on life. This often causes you moments of humiliation before attractive barmaids merely seeking a good tip.
- You don't like leaving things half finished, preferring instead to see  Full House  episodes through to completion before taking on something else.
- You prefer to handle disagreements with others by breaking down into sobs until they edge away, embarrassed that a grown male would act like that.
- You tend to be drawn to women who look vaguely like Anita Halloran from junior high.

- Unfortunately, unlike Anita, none of them are going to go out with you as part of a dare from their friends.
- Your ideal mate will be someone who appreciates your youthful salary and relaxed, easygoing approach to hygiene.
- People secretly mock the pretentious way you pronounce "penchant.
- You sometimes run like a girl when you're jogging.
- You're going to die on August 7, 2038.
