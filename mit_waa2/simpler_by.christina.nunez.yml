  You've eliminated the junk mail, cleaned out the
  closet. Banished the dust mites, shaved your pet
  hairless. But what about the emotional and
  intellectual lint in your soul? Here's a guide to
  streamlining your inner life.
  FIRST , collect all those scraps of paper and business
  cards you've collected over the years. Transfer all of
  the contacts to one book (Banana Republic leatherbound
  address book, $58) or PalmPilot (J&R Computer World, $295). While compiling your
  book, select the one friend who represents the
  happiest person you know. This should be the person
  who is the best listener, the least trouble, and the
  most sympathetic to everything you say. Write down the
  name and contact info for this person on fine card
  stock (Kate's Paperie, $12). This is the friend you are
  going to keep. Tuck away the other names, neatly bound in
  your new address file, in a hard-to-reach
  drawer (Gothic Cabinet Craft, $375).
  PHOTOS  can be restorative trips down memory lane, but
  usually they are stabbing reminders of a
  soul-wrenching past. Collect all of your snapshots and
  take a good, hard look (Modo tortoiseshell reading glasses, $250): Which is the best picture of
  you? Which is your coolest-looking friend? Which
  represents the most physically appealing person you
  have ever dated? Cherish these three pictures (cut
  yourself out of the latter two, obviously, if your
  likeness is less flattering than in the solo shot) in
  a simple, stylish frame such as Calvin Klein's
  silver-plated brass frames (available at
  Bloomingdale's, $21.99). Throw the other pictures away
  or save in a box (Coach Legacy photo box, small, $135)
  for Reflecting (see below).
  NATURE  always puts life's smaller worries into
  perspective, but sometimes requires an excessive
  amount of effort. Eradicate the anguish of watching
  your plants die slowly from neglect or bad karma by
  replacing them all with a handful of twigs&#151;any
  sprigs gathered from a local plant will do, or you can
  purchase twigs at your local art supply store. Arrange
  one or two artfully in an aesthetically soothing vase
  (Waterford Millennium Vase, $495) as a reminder of
  Mother Earth's beauty. Or replace your synthetic rug
  with a natural fiber, such as a Tahiti Seagrass Rug
  (Kensington Collection, $129).
  KIDS  are often more trouble than they're worth. If you
  must have them, try to keep them confined to an area
  you don't fuss over too much. Simple plastic covers (Coleman medium-weight tarpaulin, $29.95)
  should keep clean-up easy. Don't forget to cut air
  holes!
  PERIODICALLY  take a moment to reflect on the past: It
  helps to light an aromatic candle (Illuminations
  Energy & Love Aromatherapy Gift Basket*, $69.95),
  breathe deeply while staring into the flame, and watch
  it burn brighter as it catches a ticket stub,
  photograph, lock of hair, birth certificate or some
  other memento.
  CHANTING  is another excellent way to reinforce calm,
  and you'll find that many messages posted around you
  are mantras waiting to be discovered. "For paying
  customers only," "One flush is not enough," "Track
  fires cause delays"&#151;countless phrases reveal a new,
  spiritual significance when examined through repetition. Works
  especially well with Reflecting.
  AVOID  Danas and Billys. Also avoid people who do not
  speak English very well, and salespeople at Benetton
  or J. Crew. Pinpointing the sources of stressful
  interactions is the first step toward cleansing them
  from your life.
  REMEMBER : It is always, always about you.
