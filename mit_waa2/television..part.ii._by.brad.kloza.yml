  Commercial. "What is within reason to you?" a voice asks. The camera is
  panning very fast along the surface of the sea. "Is riding a waterfall
  down the face of a Mayan temple through shark-filled waters within
  reason?" A woman shoots down a water slide set in a temple-like facade,
  into a clear tube that goes beneath the water. In the water, there is a
  shark.
  "Is dancing beneath a dome of golden seashells within reason?" The camera
  spins in a huge ballroom with a 100-foot ceiling capped by a lit dome with
  seashells engraved in it.
  "Is unearthing the royal towers of a lost city that has risen from the sea
  within reason?" Pretty fish underwater. A shot from shallow water
  revealing the blurry image of a grand palace ashore.
  "This year, will you expand your definition of what is within reason to
  include... Atlantis?" Long shot of a hotel. "Atlantis. Once upon
   our 
  time."
