- "NYT: So, Steve, any thoughts about who you're going to turn to next?"
- "SG: Not any that I'm willing to share with you."
- "NYT: Aw, c'mon Steve."
- |
  

- Just a little hint?
- "SG: No."
- "NYT: Okay."
- |
  

- That's fine, that's fine.
- |
  

- Fair enough.
- |
  

- Long pause.
- |
  

- So, let's switch gears for a little bit.
- |
  

- What about the future?
- |
  

- Do you think there'll ever be any cars that can fly?
- |
  

- You know, in ten, twenty years?
- "SG: I'm really not at liberty to say."
- "NYT: Hm."
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- Well, let's continue with the future theme.
- |
  

- What about meals in a pill?
- |
  

- Seems to me like we've been waiting a long time for those, and they still haven't arrived.
- "SG: I have no comment on that."
- "NYT: (Pause, dejected."
- |
  

- Then eagerly:) You know what would be really cool?
- |
  

- Transporter beams.
- |
  

- Like on "Star Trek.
- "\" You think that'll happen within our lifetime?"
- SG:.
- |
  

- I can't confirm or deny anything about that.
- "NYT: All right then, I understand."
- |
  

- I'll stop with the future stuff.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "But you've got to just let me ask this one thing: Back when I was a kid, everybody thought that, in the year 2000, we'd all wear shiny metallic unitards."
- |
  

- That doesn't seem to have happened.
- |
  

- You think it ever will?
- "SG: Look, I really don't think it's appropriate for us to speculate about the future at this time."
- "NYT: Oh."
- |
  

- Looks crestfallen.
- |
  

- "SG: Listen."
- |
  

- "I'll tell you what: Can we go off the record for a minute here?"
- "NYT: (Perks up."
- |
  

- Sure!
- "SG: Now, you promise, you're not going to run any of this?"
- "NYT: Promise."
- "SG: Between you and me, the unitard thing is going to happen."
- "NYT: No kidding?"
- "SG: Yup."
- |
  

- My sources in the garment industry tell me they're no more than three years away.
- |
  

- Four years, tops.
- "NYT: (Impressed."
- |
  

- Damn.
- "SG: Also -- and this is still off the record -- the flying cars ain't gonna happen."
- "NYT: Why's that?"
- "SG: Well, it's not so much a matter of engineering -- they could build them today if they wanted to -- as it is a matter of simple economics."
- |
  

- The amount of fuel one of those things consumes is totally out of proportion to any sort of economic benefit it would generate.
- |
  

- Also, let's face it, even if they *were* economically feasible, legislating the traffic byways of flying cars would be a nightmare -- would they simply fly above the roads?
- |
  

- Could a stalker hover above your backyard if he wanted to?
- |
  

- And you've got to figure that the amount of crashes, at least in the early years, would expose manufacturers to litigation that would make thalidomide look like a walk in the park.
- "NYT: Hm."
- |
  

- I guess I never thought of it that way.
- "SG: Of course you didn't."
- |
  

- No one ever does.
- |
  

- But listen, staying off the record?
- "NYT: (Nods eagerly."
- |
  

- "SG: The hovercar may not happen, but personal jetpacks are nearly here."
- "NYT: Really?"
- "SG: As a novelty device, I mean."
- |
  

- To rent at beaches and boardwalks, in highly controlled environments.
- |
  

- Not that anyone would want to use them for commuting, anyway, what with them being so uncomfortable and cumbersome.
- "NYT: Heh."
- |
  

- Who knew?
- "SG: Also, we're just a few innovations away from having robot pets."
- |
  

- And the U.S.
- |
  

- The people who live there, they would subsist on kelp.
- |
  

- Pauses, then:) Of course, this is all off the record.
- "NYT: Of course."

  NYT: So, Steve, any thoughts about who you're going to turn to next?
  SG: Not any that I'm willing to share with you.
  NYT: Aw, c'mon Steve. Just a little hint?
  SG: No.
  NYT: Okay. That's fine, that's fine. Fair enough. (Long pause.) So,
  let's switch
  gears for a little bit. What about the future? Do you think there'll
  ever be any
  cars that can fly? You know, in ten, twenty years?
  SG: I'm really not at liberty to say.
  NYT: Hm. (Pause.) Well, let's continue with the future theme. What about
  meals
  in a pill? Seems to me like we've been waiting a long time for those,
  and they
  still haven't arrived.
  SG: I have no comment on that.
  NYT: (Pause, dejected. Then eagerly:) You know what would be really
  cool?
  Transporter beams. Like on "Star Trek." You think that'll happen within
  our
  lifetime?
  SG:. I can't confirm or deny anything about that.
  NYT: All right then, I understand. I'll stop with the future stuff.
  (Pause.
  Pause.) But you've got to just let me ask this one thing: Back when I

  the U.S.
  government is secretly experimenting with underwater cities, using giant
  bubbles
  made out of the latest space-age polymers. The people who live there,
  they would
  subsist on kelp. (Pauses, then:) Of course, this is all off the record.
  NYT: Of course.
