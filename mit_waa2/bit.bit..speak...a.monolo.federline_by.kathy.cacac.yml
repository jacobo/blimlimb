- I shake with intensity, not fear.
- My genes have cast me as a bit player in the canine biological pageant, yet I have fought my way to the spotlight.

- Against all odds, the Chihuahua has reserved its spot amid the Hollywood elite, and I am undoubtedly king.
- "Still, all I can think about as my 15 minutes of fame\x97though it's an hour and 45 minutes in dog fame\x97tick by is whether the cell phone she uses 23 hours a day is rendering me impotent."
- Mercifully, they've left me intact.

- They think it's funny when I have a tender moment with the wing chair in the living room.
- |
  

- I'm a man!
- |
  

- Allow me my manliness.
- |
  

- I may shake in her arms, but when I make love to their chair there is nothing in the world but the steel of my manliness and my love for a soft behemoth in a world 20 times my size.
- People envy my position in her heart and in her bosom.
- |
  

- They look to my eyes to read the secrets of her anatomy.
- |
  

- Are they soft?
- |
  

- Are they warm?
- |
  

- Are they real?
- |
  

- There's never a hint of sadness for my atrophied legs.
- |
  

- She carries me everywhere.
- |
  

- If I'm not clutched to her breast, I'm trying to find a place to wedge myself against the empty Red Bull cans and crumpled hundreds in her purse.
- "I will tell you this: They are as real as the sun."
- |
  

- They are the orbs in my sky, the round shapes on the horizon that mark my dawn, my dusk.
