- INT.
- |
  

- "THE BOYS' HOUSE\x97DAY"
- |
  

- SLATER  enters the living room of the perpetually dark three-bedroom house he sublets with  ZACK  and  SCREECH .
- |
  

- He wears flared warm-up pants, a neon spandex tank top, and horn-rimmed glasses, and his hair is tied in a ponytail.
- |
  

- "SLATER: Did you do the Milton reading for our Early Modern seminar, preppy?"
- |
  

- ZACK  sits on a futon under framed posters of T.S.
- |
  

- Eliot, John Cheever, and Bret Easton Ellis.
- |
  

- "ZACK: Just because I'm writing my dissertation on the anxiety of influence of  Tender Is the Night  on Richard Yates's midcareer short fiction doesn't mean I'm a preppy, you medievalist."
- "SLATER: Yeah\x97and Screech isn't a dweeb for studying the intersection of science and the gothic novel during the 18th century and its relation to Pynchonesque paranoia."
- |
  

- SCREECH  crawls out from under a mountain of library books, simultaneously reading an academic book on leeches and a heavily dog-eared copy of  Gravity's Rainbow .
- |
  

- "SCREECH: Hey, is someone talking about me?"
- |
  

- A loud, impatient knock at the door.
- |
  

- "ZACK: Here's an Austinian performative utterance: \"Come in!"
- "SCREECH: Technically, \"I am coming in\" would be the performative utterance, or illocutionary act."
- |
  

- SLATER  smacks  SCREECH  on the head.
- |
  

- "SLATER: \"I am hitting you."
- "\" How's that for an illocutionary act?"
- "SCREECH: According to the  Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms , pretty accurate ."
- |
  

- JESSIE  opens the door.
- |
  

- She's clad in a black leather jacket, her hair is cut short and jagged and is dyed blue, and she's chain-smoking Marlboros.
- |
  

- "JESSIE: ( Excitedly."
- |
  

- I'm so stressed; I have two papers due tomorrow; I need some whiskey.
- "ZACK: Jessie, you're not back on those caffeine pills, are you?"
- "JESSIE: No, why?"
- "ZACK: I want to give a few to Nerdstrom; I need him to be sharp: he's writing my application to the Fitzgerald conference in Maryland for me, in exchange for being introduced to some girls in the sculpture program at the next Graduate Council mixer."
- "JESSIE: Ugh, Fitzgerald."
- |
  

- You boys and your reverence for dead white males.
- |
  

- What chauvinist pigs.
- "SLATER: Oink, oink, mama."
- |
  

- And I mean that in the most Orwellian  and  neo-Freudian senses.
- "ZACK: As Henri Bergson might say, \"Time-out!"
- "\" Can you two ever have a conversation without it devolving into a dispute over phallologocentrism?"
- |
  

- LISA  pokes her head in the window, struggling to get through with her Afro.
- |
  

- "LISA:  Salaam alaikum , brothers and sister."
- |
  

- "My Shakespeare study group meets in an hour\x97what can I say about othering and the male gaze in  Othello ?"
- "SCREECH: Well, Stephen Greenblatt argues that homosocial tensions in the Globe Theatre may have contributed to\x97"
- "ZACK: No, you homophone\x97the male G-A-Z-E, not G-A-Y-S."
- |
  

- KELLY  joins the group.
- |
  

- Her ripped T-shirt reads " FREE MUMIA .
- "\" )"
- "KELLY: Are you guys busy?"
- "JESSIE: \"Guys\"?"
- "KELLY: Sorry."
- |
  

- "I could use your opinions on the title for my colloquium presentation: \"Disco Balls and Lyricless Synthesizer Music: A Situationist Critique of the Prom in Post-Vietnam Literature."
- "ZACK: Who cares?"
- |
  

- "It's happy hour at the Max\x97let's toast to Bacchus like the Lost Generation 2.0 we are."
- "SLATER: I hope we don't run into Department Chair Belding there."
- "JESSIE: That guy is so creepy\x97I still can't believe he joined an accelerated Ph."
- D.

- Stansbury, followed us all out to Berkeley, and somehow politically maneuvered to become head of the English Department.
- "LISA: He's such an imperialist oppressor\x97a Kipling without conscience."
- |
  

- And no fashion sense at all with that tired, leather-patched corduroy jacket from 1973.
- "KELLY: He always hits on me by reciting the same Marvell poem and asking if I want to work with him on an independent study\x97gross!"
- "SCREECH: Compared to him, I'm a regular Dom Juan!"
- "SLATER: Yeah, what a knavish, elf-witted coxcomb."
- |
  

- They repair to the Max.
- |
  

- After several pitchers of PBR,  ZACK  sleeps with  KELLY  [the audience oohs] and asks her not to tell anyone,  SLATER  and  JESSIE  get in a fight over gender essentialism before sleeping together [the audience oohs again], and  SCREECH  unsuccessfully attempts to woo  LISA  with his postcolonial reading of  The Tempest  before dropping out and returning to Bayside High to teach ninth-grade English.
