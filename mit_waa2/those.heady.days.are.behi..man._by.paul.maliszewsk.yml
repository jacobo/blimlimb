  Many will recall and few are soon to forget the events of the year 1976.
  I, for instance, remember well the original bicentennial days. We were a
  
  nation joined at the hip and all holding each other's hands,
  collectively
  speaking, all for the purpose of recognizing and celebrating the 200th
  anniversary of this nation, by which I mean this country, that is, the
  United States of America, which 200 years before had, as you know,
  formed
  itself, with the help of the forefathers, who carried in their minds
  (and
  hearts) the words of our constitution, which still rings true today,
  mostly, I mean more or less.
  The bicentennial bug bit simply everyone that year. Flags flew from the
  porches and rooftops and eaves and rain gutters and window frames and
  shutters of every home. Men and women affixed flags to their cars and
  trucks. Everywhere you looked there was a new outbreak of patriotism
  breaking out. Tiny flags appeared on desks. Still tinier flags sprouted
  from the lapels of coats of old men who favored the aftershave known as
  Old Spice. If you name me something -- something like a T-shirt or a hat
  or
  a bumper sticker--chances are good -- scratch that, chances are very
  very
  good--that that something was decorated with flags and offered for sale
  in
  1976. Festooned with flags as the old adage goes. Or is it emblazoned? I
  
  forget which. It may not be an old adage is the thing.
  All across the nation, school kids trained for then entered presidential
  
  trivia contests. The competition was quite competitive. One of my
  favorite
  books that year, by which I mean it was a book I read, was *Facts about
  These Fabulous Fifty States*, which seems related somehow, when I think
  about it, but maybe I'm wrong, who knows.
  I knew a guy who could fluently pronounce the names of every vice
  president forwards and backwards both.
  For eleven months of 1976 I was seven years old. For a little more than
  two-thirds of the year, my brother was four. We got ourselves some flag
  tattoos on our arms, the upper part, on the outside? Up near the
  shoulder
  region? In any case, they're on the arms that are on the same sides as
  our
  right hands. All the parents of all the kids were giving the kids these
  tattoos. That's what I remember. I'm not really sure why. I do know I
  had

  armpits. (These would be from sweat, the yellow moons.) Then I wore
  another, second shirt over my flag T-shirt, like a long-sleeve one? Over

  not the aforementioned yellow moons.
  On my school bus, which I rode both to and from school, all the kids
  talked about presidents from the days of yore. Some kids carried slam
  books in which friends confessed to paper private thoughts about the
  various presidents past and present. Meanwhile, back on the bus, it was
  all Who was the smartest president of all time? Who was the strongest?
  If
  George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant got into two separate time
  machines
  and traveled to this year (I'm writing this as if I'm speaking from the
  past as if it's the present, so, if it helps, substitute "1976" for
  "this
  year"), or if Washington hopped in his time machine, stopped to pick
  Grant
  up in his day and age, and then journeyed on to 1976, if they then
  teamed
  up, Grant and Washington, could they whoop the asses of Buchanan and
  Taft
  or what? I consistently voted undecided. Taft was massive. Wasn't Taft
  the
  massive one?
  One girl on the bus, she loved Abe Lincoln. To show her devotion, she
  wrote, "I love Abe Lincoln, the 16th President, also known as the Great
  Emancipator" all over her notebooks and folders until they were just
  about
  covered with writing, and then she carefully and painstakingly traced
  over
  the letters comprising the words, "I love Abe Lincoln, the 16th
  President,
  also known as the Great Emancipator" so many times and with such furious
  
  and energetic vigor that she bore "I love Abe"-shaped holes right
  through
  her notebooks and folders. Either that or her pen would explode right
  there all over the place and that would be the end of that.
  Someone said to me that the Abe Lincoln girl carved his name into her
  leg,
  which maybe explains why all of a sudden she was riding a different bus,
  
  and a seat opened up.
  The winners -- I'm speaking again of those contests, the presidential
  trivia
  ones? Back when I was talking about that stuff? -- the winners took
  places
  of honor and esteem in any number of parades. I should say parades
  occurred only about every single day of the week. Parades with fireworks
  
  and parades with Shriners on motorized tricycles with those
  pop-a-wheelie
  wheels installed on the back. Parades pretty much around the clock. As
  well as parades with music and lights and the smell of hotdogs in the
  air.
  (Also cotton candy.) Even those who didn't win the contests got to march
  
  in quite a few parades, because the ranks needed filling in and the
  numbers required strengthening and because that seemed fair.
  But those heady days are behind us now, sadly. I've said before I
  suspect
  we're not likely to witness celebrating of that magnitude in our
  lifetimes
  again, because I just don't think we will, ever.
  The movie, I'll give the movie four stars out of five, though parents of
  
  children under four would be wise to exercise all appropriate caution
  due
  to several realistically depicted surgery scenes.
