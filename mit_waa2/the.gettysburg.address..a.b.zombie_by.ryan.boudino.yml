- Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, yeeeeeahhhhh.
- Now we are engaged in a great bloodbath civil war, yeaahhh, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure, yeeeeaaahhh.
- |
  

- We are met on a great battle-field of that war, motherfucker.
- |
  

- We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.
- |
  

- It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this, freakshow, baby, yeah.
- But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate&#8212;we can not consecrate&#8212;we can not hallow&#8212;this ground, yeaaahh.
- |
  

- The brave men, living and undead, who fucking struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.
- |
  

- The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here, which was fuckin' die baby yeeeaaahh.
- |
  

- It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced, yeeeaaah.
- |
  

- It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, yeaah yeaaahhh&#8212;that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion&#8212;that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, yeaaaaaah&#8212;that this nation, under Satan, shall have a new birth of freedom&#8212;and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth, motherfucker yeah.
