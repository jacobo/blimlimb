- PROLOGUE
- Polly sat on the very top of the mountain of boxes, looking down at the battlefield where her living room used to be.
- |
  

- Now the carpet, the divan and Grandma Pendleton's favorite Louis XIV chair were hidden beneath broken bottles, rotting fruit wedges, and cardboard cartons soaked with liquor.
- |
  

- How is it that I am so alone, she thought, with such a mess on my hands?
- |
  

- CHAPTER ONE
- The whole family had been excited when the first case arrived in the mail&#151;unlabeled, unexpected.
- |
  

- The heft and muted clank of glass were a mystery to be solved, and all the children gathered their bright eyes around the box.
- |
  

- Johnny brought the scissors.
- Amanda thought it was a king-sized ashtray.
- |
  

- Polly thought she must have ordered something from a catalog and forgotten.
- |
  

- Johnny wished for a lot of toy robots, and Boots crossed his fingers for a color TV.
- |
  

- CHAPTER TWO
- Nobody cheered when they saw the two dozen one-pint bottles of vanilla extract.
- |
  

- The children were disappointed&#151;not sad&#151;but when Polly saw their bemused smiles she hopped to her feet.
- "\"Let's bake some cookies,\""
- |
  

- When the second case came a week later, Polly made ice cream.
- |
  

- CHAPTER THREE
- Polly baked cakes both white and yellow.
- |
  

- Polly made fudge and frosting and everything in between.
- |
  

- A month went by.
- |
  

- Polly purged her pantry of the less desirable canned goods and put away her ninety-five bottles of gourmet vanilla.
- |
  

- Johnny and Boots and Amanda were getting very fat.
- |
  

- CHAPTER FOUR
- At one a.m.
- |
  

- Polly kicked aside the empty boxes and opened the pantry door.
- |
  

- The flour and spices lay on the floor.
- |
  

- On the shelves Polly counted one hundred eighty-six bottles of vanilla.
- |
  

- She got a glass and a bottle of club soda.
- |
  

- CHAPTER FIVE
- Polly was unconscious at the kitchen table again when the children returned from school.
- "\"Hello, Mommy."
- Startled, she spilled the glass which was still in her hand.
- |
  

- "\"Well then,\""
- |
  

- "\"Welcome back to the fold."
- "\"Is there any snacks?"
- "\"No, I haven't been to the store."
- "\"Do you want to bake cookies?"
- Polly lifted her head and looked her children up and down.
- |
  

- "\"Do you fat little monsters really need more cookies?"
- "\"  She lurched to her feet, grabbed a bottle of vanilla and left the room."
- |
  

- CHAPTER SIX
- Polly ran out of club soda but she didn't buy any more.
- |
  

- CHAPTER SEVEN
- Was it a year now?
- |
  

- Was it more?
- |
  

- The boxes kept coming week after week and finally she stopped opening them.
- |
  

- Try as she might Polly couldn't keep pace.
- |
  

- CHAPTER EIGHT
- Three o'clock Wednesday and the doorbell rang.
- |
  

- Polly rolled out of bed, still wearing her bathrobe from the day before.
- |
  

- She knew who it was, ringing her doorbell at three o'clock every Wednesday.
- Polly took the box and climbed up the mountain in the living room.
- |
  

- She put the box at the top, tore open the central seam and pulled out a bottle.
- |
  

- She sat down heavily, and with purpose.
