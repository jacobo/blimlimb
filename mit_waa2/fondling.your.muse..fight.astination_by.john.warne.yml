- Failed to produce at a satisfactory pace for a week straight?

- Hire a local tough to deliver a good kneecapping.
- |
  

- Make sure it's scheduled during nonwriting hours, and that the blow isn't so severe as to require extended hospitalization, which would take away from writing time.
- |
  

- And if, for example, you're under contract to complete a writing-advice book and you still have a third of it to go with only three weeks until the deadline, chain yourself (literally) to the chair with your feet immersed in a bucket of acid (not too caustic, just strong enough for a tingling burn).

- Believe me, you'll have never typed faster in your life.
- I just hope it's fast enough.
