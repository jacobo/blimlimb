  Dear Josh,
  You haven't written in some time, so I thought I'd drop a line to let
  you
  know that I spied your poems at the on-line journal,
  www.doppelganger.com.
  Was the one about "the sky's dark heart" about me?  It seemed like it
  was.
  I'm glad to see that you're still pursuing your writing, even though no
  one
  reads poems, or journals, or on-line journals.  The real money is still
  in
  books.  There are many kinds of books, as you no doubt know.  But
  specifically, I'm talking about novels, by which I mean thrillers.  Have
  you
  thought about writing one of those?  If so, I'd suggest that you first
  concentrate on composing a good story.
  A "story" is something an author creates in order to generate interest
  in
  his novel from movie producers.  For this reason, it is critical that
  the
  story can be described very quickly, preferably in one sentence of no
  more
  than 16 words. For example:
  "John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald meet in hell and team up to
  assassinate Satan."
  This story follows the time-honored structure of all stories: exposition
  
  ("John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald"); complication and
  foreshadowing
  ("meet in hell and"); rising action ("team up to"); and climax
  ("assassinate
  Satan").  There was a time that a denouement or a moment of reflection
  would
  follow the climax.  This is no longer necessary.
  The smart author, after considering his story, will ask this question:
  is it
  good?  So it is often a good idea to brainstorm a number of stories and
  test
  them against a focus group.  This can be done easily.  For example, the
  above-mentioned story was submitted via e-mail to a number of
  disinterested
  parties, along with two alternative stories:
  "John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald meet in hell and team up to
  assassinate God."
  "John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald meet in hell and team up to
  assassinate all the dead presidents."
  The parties were asked a simple question: which is the best story?  And
  because some of the parties were writers, they were reminded that all
  three
  stories remain in perpetuity the exclusive intellectual property of the
  sender, and that the parties would not be compensated for their input.
  It
  is important to note this at all times, because writers are greedy and
  thieving and sly.
  The results were surprising.  Only 22% agreed that "Satan" should be the
  
  object of assassination.  36% preferred "God."  And 42% picked
  "presidents."
  The numbers speak for themselves, but it is important to balance them
  with
  common sense.  One respondent pointed out that God could not be
  assassinated
  for, as well all know, God is dead.  Absolutely correct.  And of course,
  the
  answer could not be "presidents," because then the story would consist
  of
  more than 16 words&#151;in this case, a completely unmanageable 19!
  Some respondents suggested even more story alternatives, including the
  idea
  that because neither Booth nor Oswald were actually assassins&#151;rather,
  patsies in the machinations of shadowy conspiracies among bankers and
  ex-military officers and mean women&#151;they should simply be portrayed as
  bungling goofballs who are helplessly in over their heads (ie. a "buddy
  comedy").  Such elaborations upon your original story idea should be
  discarded: they were not requested, conspiracy stories are now
  hopelessly
  dated, and they violate your artistic vision.  It's not surprising in
  this
  case that the more creative respondents were writers, and they will be
  promptly sued.
  So it turns out that the correct response is:
  "John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald meet in hell and team up to
  assassinate Satan."
  This is true...
  a) because you may now write your hero as a tough-talking,
  does-things-his-own-way, recently-fallen angel (think Mel Gibson for the
  
  movie, or  Harvey Keitel?) who must earn his ticket back to heaven by
  stopping Booth and Oswald, even though he hates Satan and wouldn't mind
  if
  they succeeded&#151;this adds "depth" to your story, which some like if it
  doesn'
  t get in the way of a good story; and...
  b) because it was your first idea.  You'll find that your first idea is
  almost without exception the best, and the opinions of others should
  really
  only be courted to make them feel useful.
  Now that you have the story in place, the novel practically writes
  itself.
  Although you do technically need a writer to pose for photos and appear
  at
  signings.  Which is why I'm writing you, Josh.  Kindly submit your first
  
  draft chapter outline and character breakdown for "Sic Semper Satan" by
  the
  end of next week.  Please note that you will not be compensated for this
  
  work, and that the entire contents of this letter remain my personal and
  
  inviolable intellectual property.  I look forward to reading your work!
  That is all.
  Your cousin,
  John Hodgman
