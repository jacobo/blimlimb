- As I mentioned at lunch last week, I'm honored that you'd ask me to speak at the wedding, and have given some thought to the themes we spoke about and the input Eve had with regard to keeping it to around three minutes.

- I know you suggested telling a funny story or two from our fishing trips over the years, and I may end up touching on those a bit, but kind of don't want to turn it into fish stories that would bore everybody.

- Pennywhistle
- Electric razor, but the old barbershop kind with the long cord so it doesn't need extension cord
- Hospital gown
- First Steppenwolf album on vinyl (the one with "The Ostrich"; I'm pretty sure that's the first one) and old record player that can be played through DJ's speakers. It's important that the turntable is next to me and I can control it.

- Are your parents religious in the proper/uptight sense at this age?

- The thing I do with the Bibles is really cool, I guarantee you, but don't want to have to listen to them yammer on about what's appropriate and inappropriate all night after I come offstage and just want to cool down and be alone.
- Also, "legally," I'm supposed to find out if venue has a "pyrotechnics Class A  AND CLASS B " license, but don't want to put a damper on things with this kind of bullshit if they say no, so asking if you happened to notice on your walk through.

- It would've been posted by main entrance (by state law).

  Hey, WB\x97\n\
  As I mentioned at lunch last week, I'm honored that you'd ask me to speak at the wedding, and have given some thought to the themes we spoke about and the input Eve had with regard to keeping it to around three minutes. I know you suggested telling a funny story or two from our fishing trips over the years, and I may end up touching on those a bit, but kind of don't want to turn it into fish stories that would bore everybody. \n\
  I will also give some thought to Eve's suggestion that I speak a little bit about how funny it was that neither of us could figure out how to get the damn coffee table put back together when you two moved into the new place. Over the last week or so, I've been spending evenings going through notes and ideas about what I'm going to be saying on the big day, but have a few questions about venue. (See below.) More importantly, do you know where I can procure the following?\n\
