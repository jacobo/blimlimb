- What started as a basically innocent college prank has gotten seriously out of hand, and, at the urging of the small group of people who know the truth, I have decided to come forward and admit it.
- I am Michiko Kakutani.
- Many people will have a hard time accepting the idea that a basically undistinguished middle-aged white man living in Hartford, Connecticut, is actually the brilliant, acerbic, reclusive, rarely photographed lynx-like New York Times book critic and Pulitzer winner.
- But I am.
- The recent disclosure that Riley Weston changed her name and adjusted her age from 32 to 19 in order to continue writing and acting in network television persuaded me that America is ready to hear my story.
- Also, I'm tired of being the skunk at the American literary garden party.

- Do you know what it took out of me to grab a whip and a chair, to go into a steel cage and get this whole Toni Morrison tiger under control?
- It's not as if I've been able to call in to my regular job at the insurance company and say, "Look, I've been up all night poking holes in the windy, specious, New Age utopian blather of some author you probably never heard of in my capacity as Michiko Kakutani.

- The whole thing started at Yale in the winter of 1972 when my roommates and I made up the name as an all-purpose coinage.
- "We'd answer the phone: \"Kevin?"

- No, he's not here.
- |
  

- This is his roommate Michiko Kakutani.
- "We'd use it as a catch-all for any nameless broken part of our stereo: \"Aha!"

- The problem's with the michiko kakutani.
- We'd use it, I'm embarrassed to say, as a metaphor for onanism.
- "\"What'd you do last night?"
- "\"Had a big date with Michiko Kakutani."
- In my junior year, my friend Scott had a job in the registrar's office, so we enrolled Michiko Kaktunai in a bunch of classes.

- I got her through Constitutional Law.

- Steve took African Art for her.

- Fred got her an A in Biology.
- We also got her into a seminar on Marxist Themes in the Work of the Lake Poets, because it seemed like something she'd like, but then nobody could stand the thought of going, so she took an incomplete.

- I gave her life.
- One night Fred asked me if I was coming out with him and Peter for late night hot tuna grinders.
- "\"I'd like to, but Michiko Kakutani has had a long day."

- "\"Colin,\""

- Fred began gingerly, "there is no Michiko Kakutani.
- I blew up.
- "\"There is!"

- She's got more guts and brains than all of you jerks put together.

- And one of these days, she's going to expose American culture for the simpering, self-referential, pretentious fraud that it is!

- I caused a lot of trouble when I characterized Zora Neale Hurston's work as "an overrated hodgepodge exalted by three generations of self-hating, guilt-ridden white men," but I got an A.

- The reader is wrong.

- Readers, I have noted, are frequently wrong.
- I did not begin leading a secret personal life as Michiko Kakutani, nor did I find it more and more difficult to do the writing required for Michiko Kakutani's life without dressing up as her.

- I have not dressed up as her more than 50 times in my life, and, to be brutally frank, one reason I've come forward now is that I'm 44 and my body is thickening, my metabolism slowing, and getting ready to be Michiko Kakutani now requires three weeks of obsessive exercise, diuretics and amphetamines.

  What started as a basically innocent college prank has gotten
  seriously out of hand, and, at the urging of the small group of people
  who know the truth, I have decided to come forward and admit it.
  I am Michiko Kakutani.
  Many people will have a hard time accepting the idea that a
  basically undistinguished middle-aged white man living in Hartford,
  Connecticut, is actually the brilliant, acerbic, reclusive, rarely
  photographed lynx-like New York Times book critic and Pulitzer winner.
  But I am.
  The recent disclosure that Riley Weston changed her name and
  adjusted her age from 32 to 19 in order to continue writing and acting
  in network television persuaded me that America is ready to hear my
  story.
  Also, I'm tired of being the skunk at the American literary
  garden party. Do you know what it took out of me to grab a whip and a
  chair, to go into a steel cage and get this whole Toni Morrison tiger
  under control?
  It's not as if I've been able to call in to my regular job at
  the insurance company and say, "Look, I've been up all night poking
  holes in the windy, specious, New Age utopian blather of some author you
  probably never heard of in my capacity as Michiko Kakutani. I'm going to
  be in a little late."
  The whole thing started at Yale in the winter of 1972 when my
  roommates and I made up the name as an all-purpose coinage.
  We'd answer the phone: "Kevin? No, he's not here. This is his
  roommate Michiko Kakutani."
  We'd use it as a catch-all for any nameless broken part of our
  stereo: "Aha! The problem's with the michiko kakutani."
  We'd use it, I'm embarrassed to say, as a metaphor for onanism.
  "What'd you do last night?"
  "Had a big date with Michiko Kakutani."
