  So what's a nice guy like me doing with the Unabomber for a pen pal? If,
  as Kaczynski himself once asked me, I objected to his diagnosis, why not
  just write a paper for some professional journal and be done with it?
  Why cultivate a relationship with him? These questions should come up
  with any journalistic foray into another person's life, but because
  Kaczynski is a killer, they require answers.
  One answer is that we had some common interests: we'd both lived in
  cabins without modern conveniences, shaken our fists at airplanes, and
  read Jacques Ellul. That's what I explained in my first letter to
  Kaczynski. But there was something else we had in common, something I'd
  left unsaid: Both of us wanted to get published.
  Is this too glib? Perhaps, but surely there's no author or aspiring
  author who didn't recognize Kaczynski's wish to be heard and resonate
  with its desperation. No over-the-transom prayers or letters to agents
  or walls plastered with terse rejections. He got what hardly anyone
  gets, let alone someone who lives in the woods: a virtual power lunch
  with Katharine Graham and Arthur Sulzberger. It's a comment on many
  things other than Ted Kaczynski's character that a person goes to such
  great lengths to achieve such ends.
  But more was at work here than a grudging respect, something more
  personal: he'd run some serious interference for me, clearing an opening
  at exactly the time I was figuring out how the game was played. Just
  before his trial began, and before I sent my first letter to Kaczynski,
  my own book proposal, submitted in the normal way, had been rejected.
  The book was going to be called either Is Your Bathroom Breeding Drug
  Users? or Oxygen Was My Gateway Drug. My plan was to report on the
  cultural side of the drug war, all those Just Say No posters, D.A.R.E.
  classrooms, and drug-free workplace initiatives deployed in the battle
  to convince the citizenry that it's in their best interests to stay off
  drugs other than nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, and Prozac. I was going to
  go behind enemy lines, as it were, talk about how this war machine
  looked to one of its targets. A major publishing house agreed to
  consider it.
  My agent delivered the news. "They think it's a really good idea. But
  the first thing someone is going to do in a bookstore is look at the
