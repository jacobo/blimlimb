- All,
- As you know, the date when we must be out of our offices is fast approaching.
- |
  

- "Here are a few helpful reminders in preparation for the changeover:"
- |
  

- As of this morning, the red phone is again routed to the Kremlin, not Domino's.
- |
  

- Please use a regular phone to place your lunch order.
- |
  

- The Monday Night Football Room has been converted back into the War Room.
- |
  

- That  is why the president is crying.
- |
  

- If Mr. Cheney has killed one or more members of your family, kindly recall that we gave you a Wii in exchange for your continued silence.
- |
  

- All staff is requested to sweep the residential rooms for hidden Bacardi bottles.
- |
  

- Please give these bottles to the president, as he would like to throw them away personally.
- |
  

- So as to appear frugal, we will be burning $100 bills instead of $1,000 bills in the fireplaces.
- |
  

- "Going forward, if you experience problems with the Xerox machine, please summon a technician\x97 not  a demon."
- |
  

- When the first lady is in her werewolf state, please do not let her out of her cage.
- |
  

- If Obama staff are in the White House prior to the transition, please refrain from eating babies in front of them.
- |
  

- Please remove skulls, scalps, and human bones from common areas.
