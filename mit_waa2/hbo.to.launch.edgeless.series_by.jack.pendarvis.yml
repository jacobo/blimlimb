- "NEW YORK\x97Production has begun on 12 episodes of  The Woman With Mild Psychic Powers , a new HBO half-hour sitcom that is already creating a buzz due to its lack of a cutting edge."
- |
  

- Playing against HBO's reputation for groundbreaking and award-winning entertainment, Carolyn Strauss, president of HBO Entertainment, today announced plans for the series.
- "\"It is exactly like other things you have seen before,\""
- |
  

- Strauss.
- |
  

- "\"That's what's so different about it."
- Executive producer Tom Havelock agrees.
- |
  

- "\"If anything,  The Woman With Mild Psychic Powers  is on the opposite edge from the one that cuts,\""
- |
  

- "\"It's on the blunt edge, the one you keep toward yourself while cutting, so as not to suffer an injury of some kind."
- The Woman With Mild Psychic Powers  follows the adventures, mix-ups, and romantic entanglements of Sara Smalls, a woman with mild psychic powers.
- |
  

- According to Havelock, the first season offers no surprises for the viewer.
- Havelock describes the show as a "light" comedy that does not skewer anything. "Skewers are sharp and dangerous," he said.
- |
  

- "\"I would rather not be anywhere near one."
- |
  

- That goes for my kitchen, and that goes for my comedy.
- |
  

- What I want to do is give the audience an outside look at popular culture.
- |
  

- Very, very far outside, where it's nice and safe.
- |
  

- Like a bear in a zoo.
- |
  

- And not one of those modern zoos where you're right up close to the bears.
- |
  

- I'm not even sure there will be any references to popular culture, especially biting ones.
- |
  

- Who wants to be bitten?
- |
  

- It hurts, and can cause an infection.
- |
  

- Did you know a person's mouth is dirtier than a dog's?
- |
  

- Or a bear's?
- "\"It's wonderful to be with these kind of people!"
- "\" exulted series star Lori Planchette."
- |
  

- "\"The kind of people who are not afraid not to take chances."
- |
  

- That's so rare in this business.
- Strauss recalled the meeting at which the show was first pitched.
- |
  

- "\"Tom asked me to imagine a field of ground that has been utterly broken."
- |
  

- Then, he said, what if we came across a small patch of ground that was not broken?
- |
  

- And what if, rather than breaking it, we put up sort of a barrier around it and made sure that no one stepped on it or disturbed it in any way?
- |
  

- And then he said, 'That's what I want to do with this show.
- |
  

- I got a chill.
- |
  

- And I still have that same chill today.
- |
  

- I firmly believe that by daring not to break ground, we will be able to do something completely precedented.
- |
  

- And I think people are ready for that.
- As for the torrents of cursing that most average citizens indulge in constantly during their day-to-day lives, HBO has given Havelock and his crew the freedom to hold back on such dialogue.
- |
  

- The result?
- |
  

- Characters in  The Woman With Mild Psychic Powers  speak in a stylized way that falls quite shy of the limits, certainly not within pushing range.
- |
  

- The envelope, also, remains unpushed in this respect.
- The same bridled attitude applies to the sexual activity that real people sometimes enjoy in the privacy of their own homes.
- "\"Having my clothes on is integral to the spirit of the series,\""
- |
  

- Planchette.
- |
  

- "\"On any other show maybe I wouldn't have done it, but Tom is a genius."
- Havelock admires Planchette just as much.
- |
  

- "\"Lori brings something so old, so usual, to her part."
- |
  

- Considering some of the things she's done in the past, it's pretty amazing how much like those things this is.
- "\"There are zero celebrity cameos,\""
- |
  

- "\"and that includes big-name stars of the '80s and '90s outrageously spoofing their own images, so watch out for that not to happen."
- |
  

- And there's an incredible list of taboos we're planning to ignore completely.
- |
  

- Everything from abortion to terrorism to gay marriage will not be dealt with in a slyly subversive manner.
- |
  

- Most of all, we are going to avoid the temptation to cleverly blur the line between fiction and reality.
- |
  

- That would just be confusing for people.
- With its average writing, competent acting, and under-the-top moderation,  The Woman With Mild Psychic Powers  aims squarely for the middle .
- |
  

- In the series pilot, Sara almost mashes her thumb in a car door but pulls it out at the last second.
- |
  

- The series is slated to debut Monday nights on HBO's fall schedule, following back-to-back episodes of  The Surfing Hobo Chronicles .
