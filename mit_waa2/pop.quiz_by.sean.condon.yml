- Madonna)
- I'm not sure.
- |
  

- Is it Rosanna Arquette?
- |
  

- Or one of her sisters?
- |
  

- It kind of looks like Rosanna, but why would she be hanging out  here?
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
- |
  

- Baha Men)
- That little monster Timmy from next door.
- |

- Who's That Girl?
- |
  

- Eurythmics)
- I think it's Rosanna Arquette.
- |
  

- Or Patricia.
- |
  

- Is there another Arquette sister?
- |
  

- Because if there is, maybe it's her.
- Why Do Fools Fall in Love?
- |
  

- Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers)
- Well, it's easier for them than for we intellectuals.
- |
  

- They have lower standards about pretty much everything.
- |
  

- Food, lovers, cigarettes, everything.
- |
  

- I pity fools, I really do.
- Where Have All the Flowers Gone?
- |
  

- Pete Seeger)

- |
  

- Bellamy Brothers)
- If I told you that while I do indeed have lovely contours the skin on my back is quite horribly scarred, would you still want me to hold my beautiful body against you?
- |
  

- Unless you meant would I resent you for giving me a compliment, in which case I apologize, and just forget that stuff about the scars.
- What Are You Doing Sunday?
- |
  

- Tony Orlando)
- Church.
- |
  

- If I don't have a hangover.
- |
  

- But I'll probably have a hangover.
- Will You Be Staying After Sunday?
- |
  

- Peppermint Rainbow)
- If I don't go to church or have a hangover, I'm getting the first bus back to the city.
- |
  

- Your parents are driving me fucking nuts.
- |
  

- But I'll probably have a hangover.
- How Is Julie?
- |
  

- The Lettermen)
- She's well.
- |
  

- She got that job at Morgan Stanley she was hoping for, and her and Jim have set a date, finally, and everything seems to be going really well for both of them.
- |
  

- Although just between you and me, I think Jim's still tomcatting with his secretary.
- |
  

- Don't tell Julie, though, it'd kill her.
- |
  

- Oh, I almost forgot, she said to say hi.
- Why Didn't Rosemary?
- |
  

- Deep Purple)
- Hey, what sort of question is that?
- |
  

- Why should she have?
- |
  

- I suppose you would have?
- Do You Love As Good As You Look?
- |
  

- Bellamy Brothers)
- You  again?
- What Will Mary Say?
- |
  

- Johnny Mathis)
- We'll break it to her gently and hope she'll be mature about it.
- |
  

- But my guess is she'll scream something along of the lines of "You bastards, how could you?
- "\" You know her weakness for clich&eacute;s when she's hysterical."
- |
  

- God, this is gonna be awful.
- |
  

- Let's tell her tomorrow.
- Why?
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Ray Smith)
- Do we have to keep going over this, Ray?
- |
  

- If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times.
- |
  

- Because.
- |
  

- And this has nothing to do with me and Johnny and Mary, by the way, so don't get all paranoid.
- Why Can't I Be You?
- |
  

- The Cure)
- Well, the position's filled.
- |
  

- Besides, you're very good at being you.
- |
  

- Not many guys can get away with lipstick the way you do.
- What Have I Done To Deserve This?
- |
  

- Pet Shop Boys & Dusty Springfield)
- You denied your sexuality for too long, Dusty.
- Can I Touch You.
- |
  

- There?
- |
  

- Michael Bolton)
- Not as long as you.
- |
  

- "\"My Secret Passion: The Arias."
- "\" And that haircut you used to have is still kind of hard to forgive."
- |
  

- So the answer's no.
- Ain't That A Bitch?
- |
  

- Johnny "Guitar" Watson)
- No, I think it's a male.
- D'You Know What I Mean?
- |
  

- Oasis)
- Actually, now that you mention it, what exactly is a wonderwall?
- D'Ya Think I'm Sexy?
- |
  

- Rod Stewart)
- Oh, come off it!
- |
  

- Are you with the Bellamy Brothers?
- Are You Experienced?
- |
  

- Jimi Hendrix)
- Not in the area you specifically require, but I'm a fast learner.
- |
  

- I know people say that about themselves all the time, but I really am.
- How Do You Talk To An Angel?
- |
  

- Heights)
- Very slowly.
- |
  

- Most of them are kind of stupid.
- Who Can It Be Now?
- |
  

- Men At Work)
- Probably the UPS guy.
- |
  

- They said they'd be here between noon and six.
- |
  

- What's it now&nbsp;&#151; around four?
- Are You Lonesome Tonight?
- |
  

- Elvis Presley)
- I'm lonely most nights, E. I just can't seem to make friends here.
- |
  

- I shouldn't have left Ingrid back in Plaistow but, God, her parents were really driving me crazy.
- |
  

- I hit the bottle pretty hard for a while because it was the only way I could stand to be around them.
- |
  

- It's just so difficult to meet people&nbsp;&#151;  normal  people&nbsp;&#151; in this city.
- |
  

- Most nights I just sit at home watching TV or thinking about stuff.
- |
  

- Sometimes I call a friend back in Plaistow and see what's up.
- Where Did it all Go Wrong?
- |
  

- Oasis)
- I'd say almost immediately after "What's the Story Morning Glory?
- "\" I realize that's an obvious answer, and quite glib, but it's true."
- Will You Marry Me?
- |
  

- Paula Abdul)
- Well, I probably would if it wasn't for the fact that you were once married to Emilio Estevez and I just can't stand that guy.
- |
  

- I'd be thinking about you and him all the time.
- Would I Lie To You?
- |
  

- Eurythmics)
- Let's see.
- |
  

- You've lied to me on numerous occasions before, so I wouldn't be surprised.
- |
  

- That story about Rosanna Arquette being at the club that night with you and Madonna was just bullshit, and that's a perfect example of the way you lie to me.
- |
  

- Probably to everyone.
