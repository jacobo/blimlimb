- Utah, 1885.
- |
  

- ALBERT , a Mormon, is sitting on his porch, drinking lemonade.
- |
  

- In the distance, his wife is picking flowers.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- There goes my fair Edwina.
- She's a perfect mate and mother.
- I love my wife so much
- I think I'll take another.
- |
  

- ALBERT 's friend  GEORGE  appears, also holding a glass of lemonade.
- |
  

- GEORGE
- Marriage is a sacred bond,
- Of which perhaps you are too fond.
- And are you not oversupplied
- When you acquire a second bride?
- ALBERT
- Two heads are better than one,
- Just like two cows and two desserts.
- And four legs are better than two,
- Sheathed in matching ankle skirts.
- |
  

- A young boy named  WARREN  is hiding in the bushes.
- |
  

- WARREN
- Fight, fight,
- Blood and bone!
- I hope somebody
- Throws a stone.
- |
  

- ALBERT  and  GEORGE  do not throw a stone.
- |
  

- They sip their lemonade.
- |
  

- GEORGE
- I disagree
- Respectfully.
- ALBERT
- I understand.
- |
  

- Go live your life.
- Go be a husband to one wife.
- |
  

- ALBERT  and  GEORGE  sip their lemonade again.
- |
  

- WARREN
- Oh, come on!
- What the eff?
- A peaceful resolution?
- Am I deaf?
- I don't hear violence,
- Rage, or retribution!
- |
  

- ALBERT  and  GEORGE  embrace and part ways.
- |
  

- WARRREN  grumbles.
- |
  

- Fade out.
- |
  

- Fade in.
- |
  

- In present-day Utah,  ALBERT , a direct descendant of the earlier  ALBERT , is still practicing polygamy.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- Nothing in this world
- Beats holy matrimony,
- But if I said one was enough
- I'd be full of baloney.
- Oh,
- When you want your laundry done,
- Call Wife One.
- |
  

- Just call Wife One.
- |
  

- Hungry for a bowl of stew?
- Call Wife Two.
- |
  

- Just call Wife Two.
- |
  

- Wife Three might be at the store.
- If you need to talk, just call Wife Four.
- And if Wife Five just got her kicks
- And feels tired, call Wife Six.
- WIFE SIX
- Would my husband desire
- To presently retire
- To our lovely marriage bed?
- I reward the man I've wed.
- WIFE THREE
- I am back from the store,
- Where I bought some new clothes.
- "My skirt might be too short:"
- An inch of my calf shows.
- |
  

- Life moves along nicely.
- |
  

- One day,  ALBERT  encounters  WARREN JEFFS , a direct descendant of the original  WARREN  and another member of the polygamous community.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- "Hey, Warren\x97"
- How's it hanging?
- WARREN JEFFS
- This is my chance
- For some haranguing.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS  tries to convince  ALBERT  that his brand of polygamy is misguided.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS
- I read our good book,
- And, on more than one page,
- It said in plain language
- Wives should be underage.
- I met your fourth wife and I started to gag.
- "What is she\x9719?"
- |
  

- That's foul!
- |
  

- That old hag!
- A wife who's over 18 is gross.
- A wife should be 14 at most.
- |
  

- ALBERT  defends his fourth wife's honor and objects to  WARREN JEFFS 's general philosophy.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- I have read of an ancient
- Rift in our sect,
- Where two beliefs
- Did disconnect.
- You have your ways
- And I have mine.
- We both can live
- In the divine.
- WARREN JEFFS
- "Listen to me:"
- I'm a big shot, you see,
- In this place of multiple marriage.
- "I'm not just a resident\x97"
- I'm prophet and president.
- So don't you dare disparage
- My views
- If I choose
- To marry them tender,
- Wide-eyed, and slender.
- ALBERT
- I prefer to plural-marry adults.
- I'm more comfortable with the results.
- WARREN JEFFS
- I am a direct descendant
- Of both Smith (Joseph) and Christ (Jesus).
- Young girls are resplendent.
- They were put on earth to please us.
- Twelve or thirteen's not too early.
- Go and ask the Lord above.
- He made them able to conceive
- And to receive every inch of my love.
- I won't rest until the day comes when
- Nubile girls hook up with older men.
- Like Dick Cheney and his third wife, Miley Cyrus,
- We'll soon overcome this monogamous virus!
- |
  

- Angry that  ALBERT  will not listen,  WARREN JEFFS  consolidates power in the community and then sends  ALBERT  and his family into exile.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS
- I'll give you the week
- To clear out of this town.
- I think that's awfully big of me.
- ALBERT
- I'm going to seek
- A place to bunk down
- And practice my polygamy.
- |
  

- ALBERT  takes his extended family down to Eldorado, Texas.
- |
  

- GEORGE , a Texan who happens to be a direct descendant of the original  GEORGE , is sitting on his porch drinking lemonade.
- |
  

- GEORGE
- We don't have much news round here.
- It's been a very quiet year.
- Killer bees stung an old man.
- |
  

- He died.
- A guy in town bought some wood and tried
- To build himself a private sauna.
- He didn't finish, and I don't think he's gonna.
- |
  

- GEORGE  sees the trucks coming.
- |
  

- He puts down his glass of lemonade.
- |
  

- GEORGE
- What in the blazes?
- This dust cloud amazes
- Me and fills me with fear.
- We don't have much news round here,
- But now there's a giant human tornado
- Headed right toward Eldorado.
- |
  

- The trucks pull up.
- |
  

- ALBERT  steps out.
- |
  

- GEORGE  steps forward.
- |
  

- GEORGE
- From the cut of your clothes
- And the boxes you're carrying,
- You look like those freaks
- Who just can't stop marrying.
- ALBERT
- We're not stupid.
- We're not dense.
- We understand our
- Sect's offense.
- But don't judge us harshly
- Without giving us a chance.
- After that, we'll accept
- Why you've taken your stance.
- |
  

- ALBERT  takes  GEORGE  to the compound.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- The setting is rural.
- The marriage is plural.
- Think of us as an
- Independent nation.
- There are nuclear families
- And nuclear proliferation.
- "WIVES 1\x9610"
- We do precisely what we're told.
- The golden rule is compliance.
- How is it any different from
- The Uniats or Christian Science?
- "WIVES 11\x9620"
- We love our kids, and others', too.
- Family means everything to us.
- And yet we're treated like felons.
- Frankly, we don't understand the fuss.
- "WIVES 21\x9630"
- Our smiles are broad, our hearts are cheered,
- Our consciences have long since cleared,
- And nothing ever goes astray,
- Except, of course, on Mother's Day.
- |
  

- GEORGE  and  ALBERT  retire to  ALBERT 's porch, each with a glass of lemonade.
- |
  

- They talk.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- I go about my business.
- I keep a level head.
- I say my prayers each night
- Before I go to bed.
- And then I kiss my wives,
- Each and every one.
- It takes about an hour
- Before I'm finally done.
- I'm not bragging.
- |
  

- "I'm just saying:"
- My life is full of loving and praying
- And working and playing and laughing and breeding,
- Here in this little West Texas Eden.
- GEORGE
- Well, golly gee,
- I've come to see
- That life is not so one-dimensional.
- For my part,
- I think I'll start
- By embracing the unconventional.
- |
  

- GEORGE  returns to Eldorado.
- |
  

- For a little while, everyone is happy.
- |
  

- Birds land in flower boxes.
- |
  

- The sun shines brightly.
- |
  

- Back in Utah,  WARREN JEFFS , who has been convicted of sexual conduct with a minor and jailed, remains furious at  ALBERT .
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS
- I was born to rule,
- I was made to lead,
- But that jackass Albert
- Didn't heed
- My word when I spoke.
- He thought me a joke.
- Now he'll learn
- How it feels to burn.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS  calls the police in Texas and reports that there are underage girls being kept captive and sexually abused at  ALBERT 's compound.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS
- "Hello, hello\x97my voice is high."
- Come rescue me, please, and come quick.
- I'm being forced to have sex and stuff.
- The guy in charge is really sick.
- His name is Albert.
- |
  

- He's so mean.
- Did I mention that I'm just 16?
- |
  

- Police are dispatched to the compound.
- |
  

- ALBERT
- Officer, what can I help you with?
- Would you like to learn more about Joseph Smith?
- |
  

- One of  ALBERT 's wives walks by and smiles at the  OFFICER .
- |
  

- OFFICER
- She looks like Laura Ingalls Wilder.
- Now let's find out who defiled her.
- ALBERT
- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- I'm confused.
- No one here has been abused,
- Or harmed, in fact, in any way.
- This whole thing fills me with dismay.
- It's just me and the missis and the missis,
- Living here in wedded blisses.
- OFFICER
- People in this community
- Do not possess immunity
- From the nation's laws.
- |
  

- They exist
- Even for polygamists,
- And so, although you may protest,
- It's time now to make an arrest.
- |
  

- ALBERT  is arrested.
- |
  

- Four hundred and sixteen children from the compound are seized.
- |
  

- The girl who made the call is never located.
- |
  

- ALBERT  lingers in prison as the compound's tangled custody case is resolved.
- |
  

- He is pardoned by President Romney and released from jail.
- |
  

- He returns to find his community shattered and dispersed.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS , who has also been pardoned by President Romney, is sitting in a chair in the middle of the compound.
- |
  

- There is an empty glass of lemonade beside him.
- |
  

- WARREN JEFFS
- You should have listened
- When I talked that day.
- You shouldn't have just walked away.
- You could have avoided
- The strain, the stress,
- The holy hell,
- The unholy mess.
- ALBERT
- Go ahead.
- You broke me.
- I'm all ears.
- WARREN JEFFS
- "Not now\x97"
- I'm dreaming of
- Jamie-Lynn Spears.
- |
  

- ALBERT  picks up a stone and hits  WARREN JEFFS  on the head.
