- The B-2 Stealth Bomber
- Packing 40,000 pounds of bombs and an extensive array of countermeasures, the B-2 should be a concern for the contemporary health nut.

- Although the major technological advances were developed to sneak past radar systems, the B-2 is equipped with sophisticated control systems that minimize any noise generated by the engine and exhaust systems.

- Just because you don't hear anything doesn't mean you're safe.
- Due to the potential for panic generated by the Stealth bomber, many states have already outlawed standing in public places, pointing (to nothing), and saying, "Look, a Stealth bomber.

- Causing panic will not help any of us.
- If you care about your own welfare, most experts recommend getting your own  B-2 bomber.

- The early symptoms of reification include a sense of fatigue, digestive problems, and extreme mood swings.

- The worker who has a career of 50 to 60 years will find the disease to be almost certainly fatal.

- The ninja is trained from childhood, after the elders have determined the potential candidate possesses outstanding physical gifts.
- Testing for sufficient physical rigor involves trials such as the nonstop 50-mile run.

- In order to keep a sufficient pace, the ninja applicant is to run at a speed sufficient to keep a mat from slipping off his chest.
- Once the strongest applicants are selected, usually by the age of 4, they are given 15 years of intense physical, mental, and spiritual training.
- Now when we say silent, we mean silent.

- Training for the ninja involves mastering such skills as walking on twigs without breaking a single one and moving in on an opponent while carrying an armful of bells.
- |
  

- Even if you are always looking over your shoulder, which is advised, the mature ninja  will  be able to catch you off-guard.
- What can you do to stay proactive?
- |
  

- "Experts have three recommendations, each of which is accompanied by the standard ninja-precaution caveat: It probably won't work."
- First, hire a decoy.
- |
  

- A good decoy will make your daily existence safer by performing activities such as taking the direct route to your workplace while you take a new, secretive route each day.
- |
  

- If you are unable to afford a decoy, a mannequin designed to resemble you will do in a pinch, at least for things like "sleeping" in bed while you hide in the closet. But what, exactly, are you saving your money for?
- Second, move.
- |
  

- The ninjas know where you live.
- |
  

- You may buy some time if you move out of town, as in yesterday.
- Third, run!
- |
  

- It is too late.
- |
  

- The decoy resembles you no more.
- |
  

- The ninjas have found where you live.
- |
  

- Perhaps you could set a place mat on your chest and run so fast that it doesn't move an inch because of your bullet-train-grade velocity.
- |
  

- There is a slight possibility that your ninja isn't going to be able to keep up, once you pass the 50-mile point.
- |
  

- Good luck with that.
- Already on the run?
- |
  

- Excellent.
- |
  

- Stay healthy.
