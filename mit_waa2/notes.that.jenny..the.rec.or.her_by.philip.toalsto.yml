- Everything looks great!
- |
  

- Just wanted to let you know how much we appreciate all the work you do!
- |
  

- Thanx &#151; Jen
- |
  

- There are some dead bugs on the stairs.
- |
  

- If you would clean them up it would be SO [underlined three times] appreciated!
- |
  

- Thanx--Jen
- |
  

- Could you be sure to clean up around my keyboard?
- |
  

- I have noticed some eraser dust there.
- |
  

- Thanx!
- |
  

- About this eraser dust.
- |
  

- It appears there have been instances of this all around town this week &#151; there are rumors that some nut has been going from office to office with a big sack of eraser dust, leaving it all around people's keyboards as a sort of sick joke.
- |
  

- Have you guys considered installing security cameras?
- |
  

- Something to think about.
- |
  

- Thank you &#151; Phil
- |
  

- One of the light bulbs in the hallway has burnt out &#151; could you replace it tonight?
- |
  

- Thanx so much!
- |
  

- There are still dead bugs on the stairs.
- |
  

- I have to go up and down those stairs every day &#151; if you could be sure to clean them up every week it would be SO MUCH [underlined three times] appreciated!
- |
  

- Thanx!
- |
  

- I have seen these "bugs" you're referring to. It is a good thing you have not stepped on any because it is my suspicion that these are actually bug-shaped land mines &#151; which is the reason I have been avoiding them. I will call in the land mine squad tonight. We'll see what they can do. No promises.
- |
  

- The trashcan in the darkroom needs to be dumped out &#151; it hasn't been emptied in over a week.
- |
  

- Thanx!
- |
  

- I noticed strange sounds coming from the freezer in the basement, as if the freezer were angry or in great pain.
- |
  

- I didn't bother to check it out, figuring that maybe the freezer was punished today.
- |
  

- You can see why I wouldn't want to get involved or make the freezer feel awkward.
- |
  

- Maybe the freezer is with child?
- |
  

- This occurred to me as another possibility, although I didn't want to risk interfering with the processes of nature.
- |
  

- Mankind has done enough already, don't you think?
- |
  

- Has the freezer been examined recently?
- |
  

- You really should have your freezer examined regularly.
- |
  

- Could you please be sure to dust around the credit card machine and printers?
- |
  

- I had to dust them today.
- |
  

- Thanx!
- |
  

- About the dust &#151; I have decided that probably the best way to deal with this dust problem would be to periodically set the office on fire.
- |
  

- Let me know if this sounds like a reasonable solution.
- |
  

- Dr. Meskie will be coming in tomorrow to use the downstairs for his classes.
- |
  

- Can you be sure to clean up down there?
- |
  

- Thanx!
- |
  

- TWO smiley faces]
- |
  

- Yes, I visited with Dr. Meskie about this yesterday.
- |
  

- We were just talking, you know, buddy-buddy like, and he told me he'd like it if I tossed a few old Kleenexes around the room to make the place a little more homey.
- |
  

- I told him I'd have to clear it with you first.
- |
  

- So &#151; does it sound okay to you if I throw a few old Kleenexes around the room?
- |
  

- P.S.
- |
  

- My mom says you need more plants in the waiting area.
- |
  

- Thanx!
