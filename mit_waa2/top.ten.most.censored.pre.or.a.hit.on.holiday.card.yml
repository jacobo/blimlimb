  INTERFAITH HUMOR A HIT ON HOLIDAY CARDS

  CLEVELAND, Dec. 3 /PRNewswire/ -- In a world where religious differences
  
  sometimes divide us, it's nice to know we can occasionally find humor in
  
  our common bonds of humanity. American Greetings is offering a new
  series
  of L'Chayim Hanukkah cards that express this spirit of brotherhood in a
  lighthearted way.
  According to Terry Kovach, American Greetings product manager, funny
  Hanukkah cards with interfaith symbols and messages have become very
  popular. "We first test-marketed a few in 1996, and consumers absolutely
  
  loved them," Kovach said. "In fact, they were among the top-selling
  Hanukkah cards in our test stores. They were such a hit that we added
  new
  designs in 1997, and again this year."
  One such card from American Greetings pictures a cartoon drawing of a
  rabbi and a Santa on the front. The two bearded men are sharing a copy
  of
  the newspaper as they ride the bus. The card's message is simple, but
  eloquent: "Shalom. Peace. Happy Hanukkah."
  Another card shows a fireplace with a Menorah displayed prominently on
  the
  mantle. A dog is sitting in front of the fireplace with a piece of
  Santa's
  red suit in his mouth. The playful message inside says, "Happy Hanukkah
  from your faithful dog."
  For Jewish folks who are committed to preserving nature, American
  Greetings even offers an "environmentally correct" Hanukkah card. The
  tongue-in-cheek message inside notes that it's made from recycled
  Christmas trees.
  Why is interfaith humor so popular? Kovach said there are a couple of
  reasons. "Hanukkah and Christmas fall close together during the calendar
  
  year, so there is a natural opportunity to have some fun with the
  secular
  traditions of the two holidays," she explained.
  "Also, in today's multicultural world, our circle of friends typically
  includes people of all faiths, and sometimes there are even different
  religions within a family. Humor offers a gentle way to 'bridge the gap'
  
  while acknowledging our differences."
  Kovach admitted the humorous cards are not for everyone. "American
  Greetings also offers a large variety of religious and traditional cards
  
  for both Hanukkah and Christmas," she said. For those who prefer the
  high
  tech approach, the company also offers electronic holiday greetings that
  
  can be sent from computer to computer via email. Their web site is at

  American Greetings is the world's largest publicly owned creator,
  manufacturer and distributor of greeting cards and special occasion
  products.
