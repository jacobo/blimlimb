- I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it.
- He gets put out if you walk by the color red, too.
- |
  

- Doesn't necessarily have to be in a field.
- |
  

- Could be anywhere.
- If you walk by orange?
- |
  

- Like, at HoJo's?
- |
  

- He gets irked.
- |
  

- "No, wait\x97more like nettled."
- |
  

- He'll be peevish, I guarantee that.
- Yellow, you better be like, "Oh, wow, yellow," or He'll get all cranky with you.
- Don't go ignoring green, whatever you do.
- |
  

- Man , does He get hot under the collar if you ignore green.
- Blue?
- |
  

- Choleric, I swear.
- Overlook indigo and He goes right through the roof.
- |
  

- I mean it, He'll rip the top of your head right off.
- If you walk by the color violet, He goes fucking ballistic.
