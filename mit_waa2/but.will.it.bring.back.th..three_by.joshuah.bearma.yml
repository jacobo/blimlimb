  Part Three:
  In Which We Wax Philosophical
  and Employ Various Literary References
  The first time scientists had to consider whether their efforts would
  destroy us all was in 1942, when the Manhattan Project was designing the
  first atomic weapons. At a meeting in Berkeley, California, Edward
  Teller suggested to his colleagues that the proposed weapons might
  ignite a chain reaction that would ignite the Earth's atmosphere and
  oceans.
  Teller determined that there was no such danger, but the nuclear age has
  not helped public perceptions of scientists. The various historical
  archetypes of scientists remain familiar: the alchemist obsessed with
  arcane truth; the unfeeling scientist divorced from humanity; and the
  Frankenstein figure, whose experiment spins out of control and destroys
  its creator. For its detractors, RHIC combines all three. "They are into
  new territory," said Walter Wagner, "trying to discover the secrets of
  the universe, without studying the consequences enough." Wagner sees
  RHIC as an example of the hubris involved in the pursuit of science:
  "Where do these guys come off, deciding they have the power and
  authority to risk all of humanity, simply to satisfy their own personal
  yen for knowledge?"
  RHIC is probably not a doomsday machine, but Wagner's sentiments echo
  our ambivalent relationship with science. We are compelled to pursue
  knowledge, but suspicious of its products. This is the paradox at the
  center of the parable of the Fall, the defining myth of Judeo-Christian
  tradition. In the Old Testament, that whole unpleasant business with the
  tree of knowledge was humanity's first irresistible impulse and
  foundational failure. And Church doctrine traditionally used the Fall of
  Man as a warning against independent thought, particularly
  investigations of the natural world.
  The conflict is personified in the Faust character, whose diabolical
  deal grows out of a desire for scientific enlightenment. ("That I may
  know what the world contains in its innermost being," as Goethe's Faust
  proclaims.) Faust is consumed&#151;figuratively and literally&#151;by his
  intellectual curiosity. Like his biblical, mythological and other
  forebears, Faust's longing for knowledge is his downfall. Similarly,
  RHIC, with its simultaneous opportunities for greater understanding and
  total annihilation, could be seen as the culmination of Faust's paradox.
  Perhaps RHIC is the telos of the drive for knowledge: At the moment we
  unlock the mysteries of the universe, we will be obliterated for our
  troubles.
  Jaffe, for one, doesn't think so. He even turns the argument on its
  head, suggesting that the Faust myth is less a statement of the human
  condition than the longings of anthropocentrism. "I think part of the
  Faustian, Promethean image is wishful thinking," he muses. "People would
  really like to think that they are gods; that we are toying with deep
  and arcane truths; and that we are involved in a much more significant
  dialogue with our creators than we really are. The people who are afraid
  of what might happen at RHIC are actually attributing too central a role
  in the universe to human beings."
  But what if the Faustian bargain is a cosmological principle? Carl
  Sagan, among others, suggested that the nature of consciousness entails
  its own self-destruction. The reason we don't see any evidence of
  extra-terrestrial life, he proposed in Cosmos, is that it doesn't take
  long for intelligent societies to develop the technology to destroy
  themselves. Sagan was thinking primarily of nuclear weapons, but his
  theory could be augmented to take RHIC into account: aliens are few and
  far between because intelligent life inevitably starts investigating the
  origins of the universe and obliterates itself with black holes and
  ravenous strangelets.
  "That makes for good science fiction," says Jaffe, "and it is also much
  more reassuring than the thought that civilizations have short lifetimes
  because they exhaust their resources and overpopulate their planets,
  which is surely going to happen here eventually."
  If knowledge does put us at risk, say physicists like Jaffe, Hut and
  Hallman, it is the biological sciences or daily technologies that
  threaten our terrestrial environment. "We were kicked out of paradise
  because of our yearning for knowledge," agrees Hut. "But the best
  application of this idea is in the dangers we know are happening:
  overpopulation, environmental devastation, and loss of species. These
  are the things that threaten life on Earth. It is less dramatic, but
  more real, than the chance of destroying the universe."
  
  Jaffe notes that the people who get agitated about "the impossibly small
  probability" of an accident at RHIC are not concerned about the more
  tangible terrestrial dangers to humankind. "We are burning up all the
  carbon reserves on the planet in a span of about 150 years," he said.
  "If you want to worry about something, there's something to worry
  about."
  For now, fears about RHIC are overblown. But they may resurface as
  technology improves. Hut and Rees's reasoning about these experiments'
  safety only holds as long as particle accelerators don't exceed the
  energies of cosmic ray collisions. And depending on who you talk to,
  that might be never or maybe not so far off. (Rees himself worries
  publicly about this very problem in his 1998 book, Before the
  Beginning.) When that day comes, there will be no comparative basis for
  any kind of empirical safety factor, and at that point, we may come to a
  real Faustian threshold, weighing the benefits of additional knowledge
  against the risks of endangering ourselves.
  It all comes down to how much faith you have in human nature. Tim
  Hallman believes that humankind is not only able to manage the moral,
  ethical and intellectual dilemmas associated with the pursuit of
  scientific knowledge, but we are improved by them. Robert Jaffe,
  although optimistic, thinks we may not make it that far. Einstein, whose
  theories got us in this mess in the first place, put it
  characteristically sharply: "Only two things are infinite: the Universe
  and human stupidity&#151;and I'm not sure about the Universe."
