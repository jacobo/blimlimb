- As the players talk,  BARRY BONDS  rises from his underground crypt in San Francisco to read from a prepared statement.

- BARRY BONDS
- Once upon a time there was a man named Aaron.
- Once upon a time before there was a man named Ruth.
- "The first one makes some sense\x97there are lots of men named Aaron."
- The second one, I am assured, is strange but still the truth.
- I raise the issue of these men for one specific reason.
- Both of them are very great but not as great as me.
- One hit seven fourteen, the other seven fifty-five.
- I'll end up with eight hundred.

- You just wait and see.
- Oh .
- |
  

- Some still doubt
- I can hit them out
- Without the help of drugs.
- Have you seen me swing?
- I am everything.
- Those pinhead racist thugs.
- I insist
- When I top the list
- Of the best to play this game,
- The clear that I took
- Shouldn't keep me from the record book.
- Children far and wide should know my name.
- |
  

- Back at the hearings.
- |
  

- MARK McGWIRE
- That song was just so touching.
- Sportswriters sure are jerks.
- They follow you, they hound you .
- |
  

- Here come the waterworks.
- CONGRESSMAN
- We have done our part
- In preserving baseball's purity.
- But let's wrap this up right now
- And fix Social Security.

- Most of the players decline to make final statements.
- |
  

- JOSE CANSECO
- From the dead-ball era to the small-ball era,
- Baseball's been resilient.

- I know that seems like a big word
- But I'm really rather brilliant.
- |
  

- "I even wrote a slogan that sums up what I think:"
- "\"Performance enhancement"
- Is professional advancement.
- Doesn't matter if we're talking needle, cream, or drink.
- "Drugs are drugs: they have no place in the game."
- We can't permit cocaine and marijuana,

- MARK McGWIRE
- I'm skinny.
- I'm scrawny.
- I'd rather be brawny.
- But bulking up takes so much work and time.
- If only I could
- Cut corners, I would.
- There's dignity in a victimless crime.
