- "\" Friendly has not been able to see or touch the gaming device since  noon Monday, when the batteries were thrown out the window by  Carnavale's best buddy Jodi White."

- White claims she never saw the  device and that the battery toss was a dare that had nothing to do  with any punishment Friendly is receiving from Vicki.

- Friendly knows he can't tattle either because currently his report card is filled  with more "

- "COMMENT:  \"The 'Q' looks like a 'Z' or a '2."

- I was supposed to be held back last year, so I obviously need some instruction.
- |
  

- It was my plea for help.
- |
  

- I was crying out.
- |
  

- No one listened, and they just reacted violently, and now I can't even console myself with video games.

- Oh, Cuba loves Reader's Digest.
- |
  

- Leave a bunch there.
- |
  

- Listen, Reader's Digest is BOR-ING, pal.
- |
  

- It's only  about 3,000 miles to the right of what we're trying to do down here.
- |
  

- It's propaganda, Garcia.
- |
  

- You think 'cause you got kind of a cute  nose, you can sneak that crap down here?
- |
  

- And what?
- |
  

- Maybe a maid reads it?

- We have to draw a line in the sand that the  Knowles can cross.
- |
  

- I mean can't cross.

- Or if they do cross it, why,  there should be a tariff.
- |
  

- A steep one that would make them think  twice about fraud and line-crossing.
