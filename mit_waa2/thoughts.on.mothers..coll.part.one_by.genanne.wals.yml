  My mother made us popsicles out of orange juice and tongue depressors. She was a doctor, but that's as much as I remember about her work, the tongue depressors.
  Judy, 34, teacher
  She made me a marshmallow fluff sandwich on Wonder Bread every day for lunch. Sometimes there was peanut butter, too, but my favorite was plain marshmallow fluff. Other kids thought that was so cool.
  Jen, 29, bartender
  She stopped cooking when she went back to school.... She did her homework at the kitchen table and kept talking about the feminist dialectic and the oppression of meatloaf. We ate a lot of frozen pizza those years.
  Dave, 37, lawn mower salesman
  Her hands smelled like garlic when she tucked me in at night. It was embarrassing because it smelled so... ethnic. She didn't know about rubbing your hands with lemon to get rid of the smell. I realized when I was about thirteen that I was a much better housewife than her. It was a calling. There are things I knew, instinctively, that no one taught me. How to make a juicy pot roast, for example. That's why I've come so far, you see.
  Betty, 80, chef/homemaker
  She said breastfeeding was for cows. How selfish is that? When I have kids, believe me, I'm gonna breastfeed.

  She wore those panty hose that come in the plastic eggs.
  John, 33, commodities trader
  The smell of Chantilly still makes me think of her in dress-up clothes. We weren't rich, but she had one really nice outfit for each occasion... she was always the best dressed, when it mattered.
  Sarah, 44, bus driver
  She never explained to me how our feet got this way. Even when I was a little kid, I had to wear high heels. The other girls were always jealous, you know, because we always had the latest fashions, not to mention great cars and a swimming pool.

  Barbie, 42, fashion icon
  She wore bellbottoms before any of the other mothers.
  Iris, 37, on disability
  I never saw her without her lipstick. Lancome Coral Mist. And she used a particular type of pressed powder that left a really faint white dust on my cheek when she kissed me goodbye in the morning.
  Marge, 56, editor
  She had party wigs... wore them when her and her boyfriends went out. A Cher-style long straight one, and a bunch of shorter, curly jobs in different colors. I didn't realize how bizarre that was until I was, I guess, in college, and I met my first serious girlfriend. One night I asked her where all her wigs were and she was like what are you talking about?

  Laura, 36, database engineer
  The oracle warned me, but how could I have known? She was beautiful, though older, and I thought my true life was about to begin. Instead it was all lust and lies... an incestuous abomination. Now she is dead by her own hand, and darkness has fallen.
  Oedipus, ancient, outcast
  I found her diaphragm shoved in the back of the bathroom cabinet, and borrowed it for my first big date. We're Catholic, you know.

  Betrayal
  I don't think she loved me. I know it, actually. I'm not bitter; I've worked through it.
  Ben, 46, lawyer
  Only two months after my father died, she married his brother. Now everyone is lying to me, and I can make no sense of it. It's frailty... moral frailty.
  Hamlet, 20-something, unemployed aristocrat
  She threw me out when I told her I was gay. Said I would burn in hell. I really don't like to talk about it.
  Andrea, 25, grad student
  At night I'd sneak into the dining room, where she kept her purse, and steal small bills. I was saving up to buy a bus ticket. I had to get the hell outta dodge. One night she was paying bills and she started crying, stressed about never having enough money. I didn't say a word.
