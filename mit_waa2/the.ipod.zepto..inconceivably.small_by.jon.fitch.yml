- Congratulations on purchasing your new iPod Zepto.
- Capable of holding 12 million songs and only one-tenth the size of the head of a needle, the iPod Zepto is a revolution in sound.
- |
  

- Once filled with music, the iPod Zepto will play for over 68 years without playing the same song twice.
- Enclosed with your iPod Zepto are a USB 4.0 cable, an iTunes 12.
- |
  

- An optional follicle-mounting strap is available.
- |
  

- Getting started
- Insert the iTunes starter disk into your computer and then connect the iPod Zepto using the USB 4.0 cable.
- |
  

- The iPod Zepto will automatically synchronize your music, create genre-specific playlists, identify songs of interest similar to your current favorites, create a Myers-Briggs personality profile based on your musical tastes, and write your New Year's resolutions.
- Charging the battery
- For best results, the first time you use your iPod Zepto, let it charge for three hours or until the battery icon shows that it's completely charged.
- |
  

- "Once charged, the battery\x97an amazing 9 microns in length\x97will last for a full 12 minutes."
- Troubleshooting
- "Q: The iPod Zepto box was empty."
- "A: It's not empty."
- |
  

- Look closely at the period-sized dot in the middle of the box.
- |
  

- Now, find the red rectangular square in the center of the dot.
- |
  

- This is the outer packaging of your iPod Zepto.
- |
  

- In a sterile, wind-free environment, carefully open the outer packaging and remove the clear-plastic inner wrapping.
- |
  

- Finally, using the enclosed high-magnification lens, unwrap the plastic and look for a white case.
- |
  

- Inside the white case is your iPod Zepto.
- "Q: My iPod Zepto stopped playing and now it keeps eating flakes of dead skin that have settled on my furniture."
- "A: That's a dust mite."
- |
  

- Unplug the headphones from wherever you've inserted them in the mite and try to locate your iPod Zepto.
- "Q: The engraving on the back of the iPod Zepto I ordered was supposed to say \"We love you, Cody,\" but instead it says \"We love Cod!"
- "A: Due to the incredibly small size of the iPod Zepto, personalized engravings had to be condensed."
- |
  

- We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
- "Q: Sometimes I'm thinking about a song and then my iPod Zepto plays it."
- |
  

- Is the iPod Zepto telepathic?
- "A: Ha ha."
- |
  

- No, although with the iPod Zepto's new IntellectShuffle feature, sometimes it may seem that way.
- |
  

- IntellectShuffle incorporates data from your PDA, cell phone, credit-card statements, browser history, medical records, and school transcripts, along with an intensive background check, to help choose the "random" playlist sequence.
- "Q: Every time I sneeze I hear the Beastie Boys' \"Sure Shot."
- "A: You've inhaled your iPod Zepto."
- |
  

- Consult a qualified otolaryngologist.
- "Q: My iPod Zepto has turned evil and is holding my family hostage."
- "A: A patch to the IntellectShuffle feature will address the evil-Zepto issue."
- |
  

- "The main things to remember in the meantime are: (1) don't talk in a condescending tone to your evil iPod Zepto, (2) don't meet any of your evil iPod Zepto's demands, and (3) don't, under any circumstances, urinate."
- "Q: I'm having difficulty synchronizing my iPod Zepto with my iPacemaker."
- "A: Connect the iPod Zepto with the USB 4.0 cable and hit the reset button."
- |
  

- The iPod Zepto and iPacemaker should automatically synch.
- |
  

- You should now be able to activate the Beats Per Minute feature, thereby synchronizing your pulse to your playlist selection.
- "Q: It will take seven hours until the evil iPod Zepto patch downloads."
- |
  

- WHAT'S THE FREAKING DEAL ABOUT URINATING?
- "A: While we can't elaborate, we can tell you that an evil iPod Zepto sometimes mimics the Amazonian candir\xFA fish."
- "Q: I hate having to recharge my iPod Zepto every 12 minutes."
- |
  

- Is there any way to extend the battery life?
- "A: Yes, if you keep your iPod Zepto's power button in the off position, the battery will last significantly longer."
- "Q: The engraving on the back of my iPod Zepto was supposed to say \"Happy birthday, Mary,\" but instead it says \"We love Cod!"
- "A: Well, who doesn't love cod?"
- What's next?
- "Look for the iPod Yocto\x97 the world's first subatomic media player \x97coming soon."
