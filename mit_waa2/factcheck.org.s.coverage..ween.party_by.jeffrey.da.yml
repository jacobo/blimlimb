  Summary\n\
  Though some discussions at the party maintained civility and truthfulness, there were numerous examples of false recollections, accusations, and declarations, especially by Seth Evans after midnight:\n\
  Neil Uhlenhake claimed that his December 21, 2003, night of sex with Sarah Nelson \"blew her world.\" But in every major report issued about that night\x97including several attempts by Nelson the next day to clarify what had happened in her bedroom\x97it is clear that Uhlenhake actually was quick to finish and also had a moment of sickness that ended with Nelson having to throw away her beige down comforter and sleep with her roommate's blankets for the following week.\n\
  Update: Nelson's roommate, Amy Bicker, wrote on her blog in June of 2006 that \"Neil is one of the biggest liars I have ever known. I went into the room not 20 minutes after Neil had stumbled out with his glasses all atwitter and there was this green mucus all over the place.

  Seth Evans, talking to host Elliott Blaufuss, said, \"Do you remember that time I totally beat the shit out of Jon Walsh in fourth grade?\" This has been a calculated and continual argument made by Evans even though most major media outlets have verified its invalidity.
