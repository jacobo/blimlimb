  When winter arrives, people in Latin America with the means, or at least the
  appropriate visa, can flee from the cold southern cone toward the equator,
  where it has not snowed in about 30 million years, and the beaches are
  astonishingly perfect, long strands of white sand dipping luxuriously into
  teal water filled with bright, small fish.
  At the election desk we have those visas, and we have concerns about the
  cold. So after careful consideration, the election desk will now be based in
  Grenada. Subsequent election coverage, already scattered, will resume from
  there if any news presents itself, following a careful move of equipment and
  supplies projected to last three months, and to involve hammocks.
  There are other reasons to leave Chile. The most persuasive is the arrival,
  to a nearby town, of a chupacabra. This animal, known also as the Mexican
  vampire goat, was not been known to appear south of Guatemala until three
  weeks ago. Then farmers discovered a flock of sheep slaughtered in a
  stockhouse in Calama, a desert community only a few days north of Santiago.
  A predator had torn open the animals' necks with fierce brutality and
  drained the bodies of blood, but, suspiciously, left the meat behind.
  Northern Chile is a logical place for a chupacabra attack. It is like
  Nevada, but larger. There is nothing there but copper mines, people with
