- Dear McSweeney's,
- I must say that the idea of a "Mark O'Donnell Week" is simply sensational. Although my dad has the same name&nbsp;-- which is cool also. However it should be Mark O'Donnell Week for ALL Mark O'Donnells because all Mark O'Donnells deserve just as much as the one the holiday was named after&nbsp;-- just because they did not make it as big as the main M.

- Dear McSweeney's,
- What happened was this.
- |
  

- The printer (dot matrix, not daisy-wheel) gets jammed and then I have to send away to Indo-fucking-nesia for a new ink cartridge, only it turns out they no longer make ink cartridges at the place I have to call, they like only make fly-wheel casters (for fly-fishermen I guess - have you ever gone fly-fishing?
- |
  

- I ask for the customer service representative, they put me into some voicemail chamber of horrors that keeps kicking me into and out of something that I later learn is called subroutine Zelda, in which muzakked versions of recent rap and hip-hop tracks play backwards, giving the listener (me) the distinct impression that he is sussing into some undiscovered Pink Floyd tunes recorded around the time that Syd Barrett went totally ape-shit nuts.
- |
  

- And so but I finally talk with some guy in (get this) Madagascar, which is apparently where they take care of most of the customer service complaints in the world (look it up - IBM, Microsoft, Nike - they all have banks and banks of customer-service phones run entirely by prisoners in and around  Antananarivo) and so this guy tells me that while they no longer support  printers of the type I own, they do offer a service whereby a guy will come over to my house and rip out any and all jammed pieces of paper, will rebuild the ink cartridge by hand (presumably using time-honored methods  known only to Antananarivians and their ancestors, or was it the Malagasy?
- |
  

- I have no idea what tradition that might turn out to be at this point).
- |
  

- So I agree.
- |
  

- And this guy (turn out to be Norse - who knew?
- |
  

- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER with a bunch of tools that I'm pretty sure are for leatherworking, but OK, he's gonna fix my printer and so I go to watch the Lakers game in the living room and pretty soon I smell smoke (and not the kind you're thinking).
- |
  

- So I jump the fuck back there and the guy is nowhere to be found, and my bed is on fire, and my printer has been taken and replaced by an elaborate cardboard cutout of a printer, done in really detailed trompe l'oeil style s.t.
- |
  

- I can't even tell it's gone except that it changed model numbers from HP 870C to HP 870Cse.
- |
  

- And so then I'm down a printer and the Lakers lose and I find in the smoldering wreck that was once my bed a bizarro burnt offering that looks like the skull of a lemur or something (native only to Madagascar, if memory serves) and at this point I decide it might be better to scrap the entire letter I had already written (35 pages in verse) and start again on my computer at work.
- |
  

- So I hope you aren't offended.

  Animal sex stories involving my grandmother, Part 1

  My grandmother on my mother's side, the one who used to chase me around

  her
  'Granny', has a patio just off her living room with a sliding glass
  door.
  She likes to leave the curtains open so she can watch the birds.
  One day there was a huge grasshopper clinging to the outside screen. I
  got
  closer and saw it was actually two grasshoppers, twisted around each
  other,
  shaking. Grandma and I watched in unashamed fascination. Eventually all
  the
  shaking made them fall to the sidewalk. Then grandma's cat Smokey
  sauntered
  over and ate them.
  Grandma said, "Well. They had their fun and now they're gone."

  Dear McSweeney's,
  What happened was this.  The printer (dot matrix, not daisy-wheel) gets
  jammed and then I have to send away to Indo-fucking-nesia for a new ink
  cartridge, only it turns out they no longer make ink cartridges at the
  place
  I have to call, they like only make fly-wheel casters (for fly-fishermen
  I
  guess - have you ever gone fly-fishing? fucking waste of time) and when
  I
  ask for the customer service representative, they put me into some
  voicemail
  chamber of horrors that keeps kicking me into and out of something that
  I
  later learn is called subroutine Zelda, in which muzakked versions of
  recent
  rap and hip-hop tracks play backwards, giving the listener (me) the
  distinct
  impression that he is sussing into some undiscovered Pink Floyd tunes
  recorded around the time that Syd Barrett went totally ape-shit nuts.
  And
  so but I finally talk with some guy in (get this) Madagascar, which is
  apparently where they take care of most of the customer service
  complaints
  in the world (look it up - IBM, Microsoft, Nike - they all have banks
  and
  banks of customer-service phones run entirely by prisoners in and around
  
  Antananarivo) and so this guy tells me that while they no longer support
  
  printers of the type I own, they do offer a service whereby a guy will
  come
  over to my house and rip out any and all jammed pieces of paper, will
  rebuild the ink cartridge by hand (presumably using time-honored methods
  
  known only to Antananarivians and their ancestors, or was it the
  Malagasy?
  who the fuck knows...), and will make me a traditional home-style meal (as
  you
  can probably guess, I have no idea what tradition that might turn out to
  be
  at this point).  So I agree.  And this guy (turn out to be Norse - who
  knew?) shows up at my house like FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER with a bunch of
  tools
  that I'm pretty sure are for leatherworking, but OK, he's gonna fix my
  printer and so I go to watch the Lakers game in the living room and
  pretty
  soon I smell smoke (and not the kind you're thinking).  So I jump the
  fuck
  back there and the guy is nowhere to be found, and my bed is on fire,
  and my
  printer has been taken and replaced by an elaborate cardboard cutout of
  a
  printer, done in really detailed trompe l'oeil style s.t. I can't even
  tell
  it's gone except that it changed model numbers from HP 870C to HP
  870Cse.
  And so then I'm down a printer and the Lakers lose and I find in the
  smoldering wreck that was once my bed a bizarro burnt offering that
  looks
  like the skull of a lemur or something (native only to Madagascar, if
  memory
  serves) and at this point I decide it might be better to scrap the

  Dear McSweeney's:
  I'd like to add to Christina Dixcy's letter about Scrotum-like town
  names.  There is a Scotrun in northeastern Pennsylvania, between my
  parents' house in New Jersey and my own home in central New York, the
  exit sign for which my wife and son and I often pass in our car.  While
  driving this route one day with our friend Ed Skoog, we discussed the
  similarity of this town name to the word "scrotum," and Ed shared the
  following facts: that 1) there was a town near his home town in Kansas
  called Seaman (I may be wrong on the spelling here), and 2) Ed's high
  school's athletic team name was the Trojans.  According to Ed, the
  local
  newspaper made good use of the coincidence, indulging in headlines like
  "TROJANS BLOCK SEAMAN" and "SEAMAN PENETRATES TROJAN DEFENSE."
  If you doubt me, ask Ed.  He is the only Ed Skoog in America, we think.
