- No. 5
- My wife, Connie
- I wanted to seed Connie higher, but she nagged me about clearing the table after dinner 19 too many times this week.
- |
  

- Enough already.
- |
  

- I have an ingrown thumbnail.
- |
  

- Doesn't she know how incapacitating that is?
- |
  

- It makes playing video games difficult, and that depresses the hell out of me.
- |
  

- I don't see what's so important about clearing the table right after dinner, anyway.
- |
  

- It's not like anybody is going to steal the dishes.
- |
  

- Instead of nagging me, Connie should be thanking me for putting her in the top five this week.
- |
  

- If it weren't for the hot sex and the cupcake making, she'd be sitting at the ninth spot, just behind the goldfish.
- No. 4
- My great-aunt Vivian
- Great-Aunt Vivian returns to the rankings after a long absence.
- |
  

- She had been off the radar ever since she failed to put money in the last birthday card she sent me.
- |
  

- But this week I received a birthday card with a check for $50 in it.
- |
  

- It wasn't even my birthday.
- |
  

- I guess she's getting old and forgetful.
- |
  

- Here's hoping she acts old and forgetful every month.
- |
  

- "I used the money to buy myself a new video game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas."
- |
  

- It's fantastic.
- |
  

- Even with an ingrown thumbnail.
- No. 3
- My youngest son, Helmet
- Helmet had a pretty solid week.
- |
  

- He took long naps and never soiled his diaper under my watch.
- |
  

- Helmet is sort of a special case when it comes to the power rankings, because he has to overcome having a dumb name.
- |
  

- Why we named him that is beyond me.
- |
  

- It sounded cool and hip at the time, but now I cringe every time I hear it.
- |
  

- It doesn't help that he has a gigantic head.
- |
  

- His head is enormous.
- |
  

- It's like a giant helmet.
- |
  

- He's forever teetering.
- No. 2
- My eldest son, Rory
- Rory managed to wrestle control of the No. 2 spot this week.
- |
  

- I sent him and Helmet to the backyard and told them whoever lasted longest without crying would be ranked No. 2 for the week.
- |
  

- Then I went inside to eat cupcakes.
- |
  

- Forty-one seconds later, Rory threw Helmet's teddy bear in the water feature and we had ourselves a winner.
- |
  

- Didn't think it would be over that fast; I barely had time to finish a cupcake.
- |
  

- Sure, some might say that it wasn't a fair contest, given that Rory is a good two and a half years older than Helmet, but a win is a win.
- |
  

- So what if Helmet doesn't speak yet and has a dumb name and an enormous head?
- |
  

- Rory won fair and square.
- |
  

- He's a fine boy.
- |
  

- I can't wait till he's old enough to clear the table after dinner.
- No. 1
- Me
- No surprise, really.
- |
  

- For the 1,759th week in a row, I've proven myself to be the most powerful member of my family.
- |
  

- "Among the nearly half-dozen remarkable things I did this week was making it past the first level in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and putting the condiments away after dinner on Thursday night despite having an ingrown thumbnail that everybody keeps failing to comprehend the magnitude of."
- |
  

- I also would like to point out that I finally finished reading that article in  Parents  magazine about "positive parenting" that Connie has wanted me to read so desperately. It didn't really hold my interest, but I read the thing during the commercials on  Fear Factor . I hope she's satisfied. Anyway, all this hard work adds up to me topping my family's power rankings once again. Given how I've been No. 1 for so long now, you'd think my family would show me some appreciation, but all I get from them is silence after I announce the weekly rankings from the intercom in my home-entertainment room. Sometimes it seems as if they're not even bothering to listen to me. It's not like my coming in first place is a foregone conclusion or anything. Sure, I'm a superstar when it comes to the power rankings, and it's clear it'll take something just short of a miracle to supplant me, but I wish they'd stop acting like such wussies about it. The way they sulk around the house, you'd think they all had ingrown thumbnails. They can be so weak sometimes.
