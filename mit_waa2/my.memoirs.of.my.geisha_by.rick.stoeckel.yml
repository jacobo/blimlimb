- The day my geisha arrives on my doorstep I feel, in a word, geishariffic!
- |
  

- At least twice a day my geisha performs this eloquent, high-risk choreographed dance for me.
- |
  

- She jumps around, twirls, and throws herself to the floor in beautiful, exquisite movements.
- |
  

- I tell her she can stop when I see her getting a little tired.
- |
  

- She knows I will be disappointed if she does stop, though.
- |
  

- I want more.
- |
  

- She continues dancing for about an hour or so.
- |
  

- My geisha loves to unwind from her long, hard day of entertaining me by drawing me a warm, soothing bath, adding salts and mixing in exotic fragrances.
- |
  

- She improvises a song about my hairy little potbelly.
- |
  

- I've always been self-conscious about that feature on my body, but hearing it put into song makes me feel special.
- Gas prices are high, and my geisha knows that!
- |
  

- She gives me rides to work on the handlebars of her bicycle, which I have nicknamed the geishcycle.
- |
  

- She loves it when I weave her name into objects.
- |
  

- When she sneezes, I tell her, "Geisha you!
- "\" It sounds a little like \""
- God bless you.
- "\" It isn't super-clever, but she smiles."
- |
  

- I can tell when she is in a good mood because she peddles faster.
- "\"Geisha, where is my hot tea?"
- "\" I scream during my lunch break."
- |
  

- She comes running through the crowded cafeteria, hot tea in her hands.
- |
  

- Her grace astounds me as she avoids bumping into a single one of my co-workers, spinning and prancing around them like an acrobatic deer.
- |
  

- She spills not a drop of tea.
- |
  

- I can't help but think what a lucky man I am to have found such a wonderful, beautiful geisha.
- |
  

- Uh-oh!
- |
  

- No cinnamon in this tea.
- |
  

- "\"Geisha,\""
- |
  

- I say, "you take this tea back right away!
- "\" She is so sweet the way she bows and apologizes profusely."
- |
  

- I can't stay mad at her for too long.
- My geisha knows that if she wants to be a part of my life, then she needs to accept that game consoles are a major passion of mine.
- |
  

- My geisha helps me by memorizing secret codes and studying maps from strategy books.
- |
  

- She has become a reservoir of fantastic game tips, tricks, and hints.
- |
  

- "When I beat Luigi's Mansion for the Nintendo GameCube, my geisha did a celebratory Sarugaku dance: incredibly elegant, inspiring, and dangerous."
- I enjoyed her performance almost as much as the game's ending, where Mario and Luigi jump up and down once they are reunited.
- |
  

- Tons of Japanese names scroll down the screen as the game designers are given credit.
- |
  

- I ask my geisha if she recognizes any of the names.
- |
  

- She giggles and begs me to please take a shower.
- |
  

- I guess 24 consecutive hours of Luigi's Mansion will ripen a person.
- |
  

- That's another wonderful thing about my geisha; she has an incredible sense of smell!
- The other day, the both of us go hang out with a buddy of mine and his girlfriend.
- |
  

- We are all having a good discussion.
- |
  

- Suddenly, without warning, my geisha breaks into song.
- |
  

- For 20 minutes, all attention is on her crooning.
- |
  

- My buddy tries to intervene with a joke, but my geisha cuts him this look that seems to say, "Geisha don't think so!
- "\" She seamlessly transitions from her Japanese lullaby into an oration on the proper way to boil rice."
- |
  

- My friends have to leave before she concludes.
- |
  

- "Too bad they missed the best part: my geisha goes into the kitchen and actually boils rice for me!"
- |
  

- Delicious!
- My geisha demands that I take off my shoes before I enter the house.
- |
  

- I have to put on slippers.
- |
  

- It is part of her crazy geisha custom.
- |
  

- I tell her it is an American custom that when you enter a bedroom, you have to take off all your clothes.
- |
  

- This has had the unfortunate drawback of her never stepping foot inside my bedroom.
- What is better than a geisha?
- |
  

- Two geishas!
- |
  

- From the moment the knock sounds and my second geisha walks through my condominium door, they are at each other's throats.
- |
  

- I feel like I have a front-row seat to a live  Matrix  battle.
- |
  

- There is flipping and dance fighting.
- |
  

- I learn that geishas do not like competition from other geishas.
- |
  

- I learn that there can be too much of a geisha thing.
- |
