- STELLA
- It was a hot afternoon - perfect for a swim - but I'd promised Stella I'd meet her at the train station.
- |
  

- Around two o'clock I took my bicycle and started out.
- |
  

- When I arrived at the train station, Stella wasn't there.
- |
  

- Then I realized I wasn't at the train station, but in a hut made of tongue depressors and pieces of gum.
- |
  

- Still, where was she?
- |
  

- THE BEST YAHOO EVER
- The best yahoo I ever had was with Yahoo.
- |
  

- We did it yahoo yahoo yahoo yahoo yahoo yahoo and it lasted for yahoo.
- |
  

- It was great and I remember it vividly.
- |
  

- DREAM
- I dreamed I split into my good and evil selves and found that without the evil part I dithered too much to command The Enterprise.
- |
  

- FLY
- Why should a fly infuriate you when you're trying to fall asleep, even if it's clicking castanets and wearing a beanie with a propeller?
- |
  

- THE GIFT OF COAL
- Give a lover an expensive diamond ring and that lover will probably lose it in a cocktail lounge when they're getting drunk with their sexy co-worker.
- |
  

- But give a lover a lump of coal and they can carry it around all day and squeeze it very tightly in their hand and eventually it might turn into a diamond, although it should still have a nice setting.
- |
  

- WHERE WE FOUND YOU
- |
  

- CARP
- My brother raised some carp in a fish pond in our back yard.
- |
  

- One time, as a joke, my friend and I were really high and we leaned out my bedroom window and shot all the carp with a rifle.
- |
  

- Then we threw the fish in the street and my brother ran over them in his car when pulling into the driveway.
- |
  

- The thing was he failed to see the humor in the situation.
- |
  

- Hey, Randy, loosen up!
- |
  

- GREAT EXPECTATIONS
- Sorry if you thought this would be interesting.
- |
  

- It's not.
