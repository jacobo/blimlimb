  Millions of people around the world watched, pizza in hand, resulting in\n\
  an 11.4 percent increase in sales compared to a normal day for Domino's\n\
  Pizza.\"\n\
  But we wanted to know more. We wanted to know the following:\n\
  On May 14, the day that Frank Sinatra, a known Italian, died, did\n\
  Americans eat more pizza, or less?\n\
  On August 7, the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were\n\

  We present them here, to you:\n\
  + The death of Ol' Blue Eyes, Mr. Francis Albert Sinatra, on May 14\n\
  whetted our appetite for another Italian-American specialty. Sales for\n\
  Domino's bubbled up 12.1 percent over normal Thursdays. Sinatra is a\n\
  known Italian.\n\
  + Americans lose their appetite when it comes to international\n\
  terrorism. Weekday sales dipped 6 percent on August 7, when the U.S.\n\
  embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed. We had another bad\n\
  day two weeks later, on August 20, when U.S. forces retaliated against\n\
  Khartoum; Domino's sales wilted 2 percent off the norm.\n\
  + Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London made us feel conflicted, as Spain\n\
  imposed its law, perhaps not quite legally, upon the deposed dictator\n\
  from Santiago. While we gave the matter some thought on that day,\n\
  October 17, we phoned Domino's \x96- and sales shot up 5.8 percent over\n\
