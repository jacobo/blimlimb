  INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT
  (CARRIE  is typing on her MacBook Air. )
  CARRIE: ( V.O. ) Every year, thousands of women move to New York hoping to find two things: love and the crystal skull. After 20 years, I had finally found love with the man of my dreams, but he still hadn't asked me the big question. The one every New York woman wants to hear: "Will you find the crystal skull with me?" I had to wonder: Was it all just a myth? Or could a New York woman really ever have it all: work, love, and a skull given to us from an alien planet?
