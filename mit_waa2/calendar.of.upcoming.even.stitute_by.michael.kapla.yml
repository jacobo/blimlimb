- Sean Oggie is an ordinary person just like you, with special unrecognized talents (just like you).
- |
  

- "Actor, dancer, writer, game designer, architect, slide guitarist, and post-digital entrepreneur, Sean is a self-taught life coach and emotional visionary who, having experienced his share of hard knocks, discovered how to turn them into   hardknockade  \x99. His seminars and techniques have earned him devoted followers around the country, and he is planning to expand into the corporate realm in 2009."
- "Here is our exciting calendar for spring 2008:"
- Sing the Song of You
- "LOS ANGELES, MARCH 10\x9611"
- Music is fundamental to our well-being.
- |
  

- Through heightened listening, toning, singing, and guided meditation, participants will access the life-enhancing powers of their own melodic nature and abilities.
- |
  

- Sean Oggie will reunite with his high-school band, Meat Sauce Roar, adding his associate-in-training, Porf, on percussion.
- |
  

- The intrinsic power of rhythm to heal (or, if not to heal, to give voice to some pretty righteous bile) will be demonstrated during the world-premiere performance of Sean's online alt-rock songspiel,  Erica, Alas .
- Limited to 12 participants.
- |
  

- Sleeping bags not provided.
- "Parents and Children:"
- The Great Reversal
- MARCH 22
- It may be  the  most challenging dynamic facing our generation today.
- |
  

- Children grow up to become adults, only to still be treated like children.
- |
  

- Simply because of cash-flow issues.
- |
  

- Sean Oggie will sit down with his father, Dr. Paul Oggie, and try to "unpack" old grievances, resolve misunderstandings, and borrow $1,500 to cover the shortfall of recent East Coast workshops. This is a teleconference event only, and will be available on exclusive webcam. A question-and-answer session via speakerphone will take place immediately afterward.
- No space limitations.
- |
  

- What Men Want,
- What Women Want
- "LOS ANGELES, APRIL 4\x966"

- |
  

- Porf will lead a drumming circle.
- Limited to 18 participants, 9 per gender.
- |

- Unfulfilled expectations carry equal parts pain and release.

- |

- |
  

- Attendees will participate in a reading of Sean's screenplay about vampires in an underground parking structure.
- Limited to 10 participants.
- |
  

- Building Blocks
- "NORTH HOLLYWOOD, APRIL 22\x9623"
- Manual labor is good for the heart, good for the soul.
- |
  

- Many spiritual leaders have pointed this out, most recently the character of God in  Evan Almighty .
- |
  

- In this workshop, we will work around Dr. Oggie's house, examining and reshaping the arc of our lives while tearing out the old redwood deck and building a new one.
- |
  

- This promises to be a magical weekend, steeped in human metaphor.
- |
  

- The program will neatly divide into three sessions.
- |
  

- "DEMOLITION : What is it in ourselves and our past that we are ready to smash once and for all and leave to be hauled away?"
- |
  

- "FRAMING : Where are we headed next?"
- |

- |
  

- Should this make Sean feel humbled?
- |
  

- Motivated?
- |
  

- Envious?
- |
  

- Why does society encourage us to compare ourselves with blood kin instead of, say, the losers in front of the Fosters Freeze?
- |

- Limited to 6 participants.

- The Soul of Debt
