- Welcome.
- Whether you stay with us for a single night or for an extended, indefinite period, you'll find that our entire staff is dedicated to making your visit highly propitious and, ultimately, redemptive.
- |
  

- To ensure that your visit is as enjoyable as the prevailing circumstances allow, we invite you to look over the many guest services listed on the following pages.
- The Management
- Hyatt Regency Purgatory
- |
  

- "ATM \x97An automatic-teller machine is located in the lobby."
- |
  

- For your convenience, it is attended at all hours and in perpetuity by the bank executive who came up with the idea of ATM fees.
- "Automobile Rental \x97Should you wish to explore the sights and attractions of Purgatory by car, you may rent one at the front desk."
- |
  

- The Buick Lucerne is the official car of Purgatory.
- "Business-Office Services \x97With the latest technology, equipment, and resources, we can make you photocopies, provide a Windows-based PC with Microsoft Office, supply wireless Internet access, produce color laser prints, even arrange secretarial services."
- |
  

- If we may gently remind you, however, you are dead and, therefore, no longer have anything to prove.
- "Caf\xE9 Limbo \x97Specializing in taste-neutral cuisine, Caf\xE9 Limbo prides itself on reminding diners of one of the pleasures of the flesh without giving any pleasure to the flesh."
- |
  

- A sumptuous Sunday brunch buffet of over 50 hot and cold items is never available to guests, due to the restaurant being closed on the Sabbath.
- |
  

- "The caf\xE9 (on the mezzanine, across from the Pope Innocent III Chapel) is also closed on all holy days, saints' days, and feast days."
- "Checkout Time \x97TBD."
- |
  

- By God.
- |
  

- "Concierge \x97Our Assistance Express\xAE staff is thoroughly committed to and entirely capable of making your visit as bearable as, but not one iota more bearable than, permitted by divine law."
- |
  

- All associates have an extensive knowledge of Purgatory, its many points of interest and myriad activities.
- |
  

- They can arrange everything from concert tickets (Jim Morrison, Karen Carpenter, Joey Ramone, and John Denver, to name just a few; plus, coming this fall, Amy Winehouse) to Jetpack Adventures for "pre-angelic" flying lessons. Or get directions to one of the million-plus bingo halls the transitional realm has to offer.
- "Convention Services \x97Whether you're here with three buddies from an alcohol-related car accident, several hundred passengers from a plane crash, or the population of a major metropolis destroyed by meteor, the Hyatt Regency Purgatory can accommodate your group's needs."
- |
  

- Ask the manager on duty for additional information.
- "Express Checkout \x97For guests who arrive at the property in possession of Indulgences, the HeavenExpress\xAE kiosk (located in the lobby, near the Pope Boniface IX Chapel) offers a swift, efficient, and immediate checkout experience."
- |
  

- Simply follow the touch-screen instructions and insert the requested number of Indulgences at the prompt.
- "Fitness Center \x97Guests who discover that existing as pure energy has given them energy to burn will find a variety of spiritual workout equipment in the fitness center (on the second floor, next to the Pope Clement VI Chapel)."
- "Ice \x97Ice machines can be found on every floor."
- |
  

- Guests are welcome to help themselves to as much ice as desired, except when enduring mandatory periods of purifying fire.
- "Newspapers \x97A complimentary copy of  USA Today  will be delivered to your room each weekday."
- |
  

- "Note: Though some guests may tell you that reading  USA Today  every morning is \"hell,\" we can assure you that it is not  actually  Hell.)"
- "On-Request Items \x97Should the need arise, our front desk can provide you with a variety of practical, everyday items for your personal use, including: rosaries, scapulars, prayer mats, prayer shawls, prayer cards, prayer books, Old and New Testaments,  Humanae Vitae , hymnals, crosses/crucifixes, saint statuettes, saint medals, communion wafers and sacramental wine, holy water, hair shirts, votive candles, and antiseptic footwash."
- "Pool \x97Open 24 hours."
- |
  

- Though it's unheated, some guests may find that immersion in the pool's holy water sears their corrupt flesh.
- "Room Service \x97Room service is available 24 hours a day, though use of this service is considered slothful and may extend your stay."
- "Telephone Instructions:"
- |
  

- To call another hotel guest, dial the guest's room number.
- |
  

- When prompted, pray to be connected.
- |
  

- Should your prayer go unanswered, hang up and pray for guidance.
- |
  

- For all calls within the Purgatory area code, touch 9 plus the phone number, then, using the alphanumeric keypad, carefully key in the text of three Hail Marys and two Our Fathers.
- |
  

- Long-distance calls to either permanent afterlife location may be placed through the hotel's Ethereal Switchboard.
- |
  

- Be advised, however, that denizens of Hell are rarely released from their torments to take calls and in Heaven there are no phones.
- "Wake-up Call \x97If we may be frank: The time for wake-up calls is over."
- |
  

- If you'd heeded any of the several provided to you in the physical world, you wouldn't be here.
- |
  

- From all of us at the Hyatt Regency Purgatory, we wish you the briefest of stays.
- |
  

- And we kindly beseech you to put in a good word for us upon reaching your final destination.
