  As an employee of a check-cashing outlet near Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., my
  nephew was familiar with the recklessness with which many young recruits
  would spend their pay.  Late one Saturday evening, a soldier attempted to
  cash a check while a raucous group of his buddies waited inside the
  entrance to the store.  When my nephew asked him where they were headed
  that night, the soldier mentioned the name of a local gentleman's club.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," my nephew replied, handing him a card from a stack that he had been
  paid to distribute. "Why don't you try J. P. Britches' tonight?  It's a new
  place, and I'm sure you'll get more for your money there." &#151;&nbsp;Contributed by
