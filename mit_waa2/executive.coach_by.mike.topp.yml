  Sitting at a meeting at work, your thoughts wander and you find yourself drawing... drawing little pictures and designs. Doodling is an expression of your unconscious mind, and often doodles express subconscious thoughts and desires. Some psychiatrists even use doodles to help analyze their patients.
  If you find yourself doodling, maybe your doodles are one of these:
