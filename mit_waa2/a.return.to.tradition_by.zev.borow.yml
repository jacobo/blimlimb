  SETUP:
  Last month, aided by rifles, power boats, and shiny, top-of-the-line
  harpoon guns, members of the Makah Indian tribe of Washington State
  conducted the first legal whale-hunt in American waters in 75 years,
  resurrecting one of the tribe's great seafaring traditions. Now, a month
  later, several other groups and individuals are calling for restrictions
  to be removed on activities integral to their own proud traditions.
  LAFFS:
  A group of Rome-based legislators is asking those currently residing in
  the nations of Europe, North Africa, and the majority of the Middle East
  to pay Romans a monthly stipend. "Everyone remembers the Roman empire,
  right?" the group's leader, Anthony R. Thomaso, said recently. "Well,
  there was a little tradition back then about other countries paying
  Rome, usually on a monthly basis, some kind of tribute: cattle, spices,
  the finest silks... All we're asking now is that this tradition be
  reinstated. Except this time we'd like cash, dollars actually. Or
  scooters. Fast ones, with horns. How else will our children know what it
  means to be Roman?"
  "Do you know what a beating human heart feels like just after you've
  ripped it out of some loser's chest?" asked Scintillo Xranxes in the
  hopes of convincing Mexican authorities to allow him and three families
  descended from Mayan chieftains to rip the still-beating hearts out of
  the losers of a planned re-enactment of a pre-Columbian Mayan ball game,
  the losers of which would, historically, have their hearts ripped out by
  chieftains. "If the government does not show some compassion in this
  matter," he went on to say, "my young son might never know what it feels
  like to rip the still-beating heart out of the chest of the loser of an
  athletic contest."
  A group of high-level current and former United States intelligence
  operatives representing a range of government and military agencies have
  hired a Washington lobbying firm to push for legislation reviving the
  tradition of "U.S. intelligence operatives secretly engineering border
  wars and coup de etats, and generally being thought of as slightly evil,
  but cool and dangerous, as opposed to slightly evil, poorly attired, and
  not good with maps."  The operatives would like Congressional approval
  for two chances to topple the elected government of Antigua.
  Unconfirmed reports have been leaking out of Vatican City that the
  Catholic Church would like to see the various international constraints
  regarding killing heretics "relaxed" so that the Church's long-dormant
  tradition of killing non-believers and other generally blasphemous
  individuals might live again, if only for a few weeks a year. A Vatican
  spokesperson would neither confirm nor deny the reports, stating only:
  "There are many historical traditions we would like to see revived, and
  I'd be lying to you if I said killing heretics wasn't one of them."
