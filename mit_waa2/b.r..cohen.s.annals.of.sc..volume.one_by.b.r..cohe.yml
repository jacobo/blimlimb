- Lavoisier, Priestley, and Oxygen, Or, The Tyranny of Purity
- You're thinking oxygen is good.
- |
  

- It tastes good.
- |
  

- It is clear, clean, pure.
- |
  

- You're thinking it is infinite, eternal, ubiquitous.
- |
  

- You're thinking earth's atmosphere here, of course, but I follow you.
- |
  

- You're also thinking Lavoisier v. Priestley, the fight for the discovery of that most lovable element (with all due affection to carbon).
- |
  

- You're also attuned to a certain cynical expectation by now, that what you thought you thought is not really what you think.
- |
  

- Can't anything get discovered without controversy anymore?
- |
  

- You're thinking this, I can tell.
- |
  

- You're up on phlogiston, true?
- |
  

- Because if you're not, then we're done here.
- |
  

- Because if you don't want to come to terms with the fact that, for the chemical community, explaining why things burned before the 1780s was an exercise in measuring the phlogiston in a substance &#8212; the thing that made it burn &#8212; then where can this relationship go?
- |
  

- If you're thinking, I thought Lavoisier was a haberdasher, Priestley a milliner, or an actor in a teen nighttime soap opera, then we're talking past each other.
- |
  

- Because no.
- |
  

- One was French.
- |
  

- One was English.
- |
  

- One was on his way to decapitation, Dr. Guillotine style.
- |
  

- One was on the boat to America, get-out-of-dodge-because-I'm-a- religious-radical style.
- |
  

- But in those glory days of the 1780s, before it all got trumped up, before the amber glow of a million bottled fireflies faded out, before, well, just before it all became so commercial, in those glory days, coming up with the idea of oxygen, an idea so crazy it took a revolution to pound it out, was all there was, man.
- |
  

- Lavoisier was charming; Priestley, beautiful.
- |
  

- They both wanted it, the title of discoverer of oxygen.
- |
  

- In the end, think of oxygen as a language, not an element.
- |
  

- There's nothing twee in that.
- |
  

- Sometimes answers aren't what we're looking for.
