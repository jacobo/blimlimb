- Sterna paradisaea , or the Arctic tern, is a seabird that breeds in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.
- |
  

- Also, a species the chairman of a respected university zoology department might be sent away on sabbatical to study for four months to clear his head after an emotional breakdown.
- Breeding Grounds
- No roads.
- |
  

- No electricity.
- |
  

- To study this creature, one is airdropped by helicopter, along with an all-terrain vehicle, a tent, and four months' worth of freeze-dried food.
- Reproduction
- Arctic terns mate for life, unlike wives of zoology-department chairs.
- |
  

- At no time was a female tern observed in a foreign nest, especially not one belonging to another zoology professor or, say, a fraternity-house "kegger" nest. All the female terns stayed in their own damn nests, incubating their own damn eggs, just as evolution intended.
- Courtship
- Within the Arctic-tern colony, courtship involves an intimate dance of strutting, with heightened tail and low extended wings.
- |
  

- Which is different from how it works on a university campus, where it involves 17 years of nurturing a false marriage, ignorant as the female sleeps her way through the zoology department, followed by the English department, followed by the university rowing team and various members of the golf-course grounds crew.
- Communication
- Terns emit continuous high-pitched shrieks.
- |
  

- There are a quarter-million terns in a colony emitting these jarring cackles, so an observer might lie awake all night wondering how things had come to this.
- Migration
- "Arctic terns scatter when an observer\x97on a three-day bender drinking homemade swill and hallucinating on berries picked from local flora\x97drives through their flock in an all-terrain vehicle."
- |
  

- The terns tend to squawk in one cacophonous pitch as the observer hollers Fleetwood Mac lyrics, swerving back and forth through their nesting grounds, praying for a sinkhole or ditch that would halt the vehicle suddenly and snap his neck.
- Aggression
- Arctic terns are a selfish species.
- |
  

- Although a colony can lay up to 1 million eggs, they defend to the death each one.
- |
  

- Should an observer, tired of eating freeze-dried food for seven weeks, attempt to obtain a solitary egg for his breakfast, he would be chased by the flock back to his tent.
- Feeding
- Arctic terns feed on small marine invertebrates.
- |
  

- Each morning, the colony heads to sea.
- |
  

- This presents an ideal opportunity to observe the nests and collect breakfast.
- Survival of the Fittest
- An observer is better off simply targeting the hatchlings and the old, weak, and injured adults.
- |
  

- Arctic tern, mostly dark meat, is an excellent source of protein.
- |
  

- Once the feathers are removed, the meat can be used for tern Stroganoff, tern burgers, and mac-a-terni and cheese.
- Retail Use
- A Norwegian hunting party noticed several tern pelts drying in the tent, along with a tern smoking jacket I had crafted.
- |
  

- They offered $10 per pelt.
- |
  

- Apparently, the Arctic terns are the lifeblood of the Norwegian hat-making industry.
- |
  

- Over a dinner of tern schnitzel, a business agreement was forged, making me a tern-pelt supplier.
- Behavior
- As a species, Arctic terns are suspicious by nature.
- |
  

- Should a couple thousand of their brethren come up missing, the colony will single out the one observer wearing a tern smoking jacket and stare at him for long periods.
- |
  

- Incredibly long periods.
- |
  

- A quarter-million birds.
- |
  

- Just staring.
- |
  

- All day.
- Physiology
- Arctic terns have no sense of humor.
- |
  

- When an observer, crazed from living among fowl for 14 weeks, begins yelling humorous sayings at them, they just continue to stare.

- "\" As the World Terns !"
