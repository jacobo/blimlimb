- At the root of the "Jackass" project is an impulse to deny the superego and approach the universe, with all its hard edges and shark-infested waters, as an enormous, undifferentiated playpen. That, and the impulse to watch a 400-pound woman belly-flop on top of a midget.

- Dear Theo,
- Jackass Number Two  premiered today, and imagine my delight upon reading the astute, uplifting review by Nathan Lee of the  New York Times  (highlighted clipping enclosed).

- Could it be that someone in this vast, indifferent universe truly understands the bittersweet post-Freudian struggle that I have so long expressed in my work?
- |
  

- Yes, the diminutive gentleman whom Lee mentions is technically a dwarf, but no matter; the important thing is that my voice is being heard!
- |
  

- And to think that just yesterday Steve-O called my proposal to stuff my entire head in an elephant's rectum "contrived.
- "\" (I had not even gotten to the part in which I retrace Hannibal's route across the Alps."
- |
  

- I believe Steve-O's heart may no longer be in the work, Theo.
- |
  

- Last week, before sliding naked down a log flume flanked with razor wire, he smeared his body with shaving cream to "
- |
  

- "\" (his words)."
- |
  

- Where is the artistic purity?

- September 2006
- Dear Theo,
- Distracted today.
- |
  

- Although juggling porcupines normally would command my undivided concentration, I cannot help but analyze the implications of the "midget" reference. As Wee Man confirmed, "midget" is an antiquated term for a proportional dwarf; clearly our dwarf was anything but proportional, so why the contradiction?
- |
  

- By using carnival terminology, is Mr. Lee suggesting that my work merely recapitulates, rather than deconstructs, the 19th-century freak show?
- |
  

- "Does he mean to subliminally impose a formalist aesthetic on my self-consciously asymmetric mise en sc\xE8ne?"
- |
  

- Did the camera angle unintentionally create the illusion of proportion?
- |
  

- If so, the irony is not lost on me, but does this not change the entire meaning of the sequence, and, by extension, the film?
- |
  

- Perhaps I should have used a quadriplegic.
- Johnny

- September 2006
- Dear Theo,
- I am in love!
- |
  

- It happened during a promotional stunt in the Caribbean.
- |
  

- You may recall that I planned to have unprotected sex with 300 consecutive Haitian prostitutes, but Aphrodite herself stopped me cold at number 267.
- |
  

- After the shoot, Giselle and I spent a blissful afternoon riding in the centrifuge of a local sugar refinery, and discovered that we share passions for Alsatian cuisine, Puccini opera, and stapling our lower lip to roof shingles.
- |
  

- Although we have known each other for only a few days, I can already imagine Giselle bearing our children, perhaps while hanging from a bungee cord over a nest of Mexican pit vipers.
- |
  

- Who would have thought I could harbor such quaint domestic fantasies?

- |
  

- Reshot the belly-flop sequence using a proportional dwarf.
- |
  

- Lee was right; it makes much more sense now.

- October 2006
- Dear Theo,
- "Reached an epiphany on the dwarf sequence: the illusion of proportion was coming not from the dwarf himself but from the relative disproportion of the 400-pound woman, whose breasts and abdominal rolls differ substantially in size and shape."
- |
  

- "Experimented with less portly subjects but discovered it was better to go to the other extreme: women over 600 pounds are essentially spherical, thereby drawing attention to the dwarf's irregular limbs (a metaphor, I realize now, for America's growing socioeconomic inequality)."
- |
  

- Also, they sound funnier on impact.
- I fear Steve-O may be resentful of Giselle.
- |
  

- Yes, she is not part of the regular crew, but when I let her tag along as we ran through an Alabama forest in deer costumes on the first day of hunting season, S. complained incessantly that Giselle's antlers were upstaging him.
- |
  

- Even absorbing a round of buckshot to the thigh did little to boost his mood.
- |
  

- That night, in a gesture of fraternity, I snuck into his bedroom and immersed his scrotum in a cup of liquid nitrogen, but he just turned over and sighed.
- |
  

- "Fortunately, others in the crew, especially Wee Man, have welcomed Giselle into the fold; tonight the three of us enjoyed a scrumptious dinner of  moules proven\xE7ales , climbed a heap of scrap metal, and admired the stars."
- |
  

- Ah, simplicity.
- Johnny
- |
  

- October 2006
- Dear Theo,
- Despair!
- |
  

- Giselle has left me!
- |
  

- She and Wee Man ran off together in the dead of night, according to the note she engraved into my buttocks with a welding torch.
- |
  

- "How could I have been so blind\x97apart from the fact that I recently spray-painted my eyeballs black?"
- |
  

- In a fit of self-loathing, I cut off my left ear, but, surprisingly, the bleeding was far too contained to register on the big screen, so I tried the right one as well, only to learn that the cameras had not been rolling.
- |
  

- One thing led to another and suffice it to say that I am writing this letter by clenching the pen in my one remaining nostril.
- |
  

- Please excuse any illegible markings.
- Despondently,
- J.
- |
  

- October 2006
- Dear Theo,
- This will be the last letter I write to you.
- |
  

- I cannot live without Giselle, so I shall end my life with one final act of devotion.
- |
  

- First, I will ride against traffic on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, sitting naked on the horn of an amphetamine-cranked rhinoceros.
- |
  

- At a predetermined point I will backflip off the rhino and into an authentic medieval catapult, which will hurl me into a head-on collision with a 600-pound woman (launched from a cannon), which will, in turn, send me reeling into a giant turbine of rotating machete blades.
- |
  

- As the blades hack me to bits, the resulting parts will spew onto a barge in the East River, igniting GPS-guided fireworks that will shoot through Wee Man's apartment window and explode over their bed, spelling Giselle's name across the ceiling and almost certainly setting the building on fire.
- |
  

- Please tell Jeff Tremaine to film this in hi-def, and to use multiple cameras, as retakes will be impractical.
- Yours sincerely,
- Johnny
- P.
- S.

- Do you think I should work in a dwarf?
