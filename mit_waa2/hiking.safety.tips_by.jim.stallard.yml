- WARNING!
- |
  

- MOUNTAIN LIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SIGHTED IN THIS AREA
- |
  

- PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONARY GUIDELINES TO ENSURE  A SAFER HIKE
- |
  

- Keep close watch on small children in your group.
- |
  

- They are mountain-lion magnets.
- |
  

- Once on the trail, get away from them as fast as possible.
- Pets that are off-leash may increase your danger.
- |
  

- A dog that runs ahead of you on the trail may encounter a mountain lion and run to you for protection, leading the threat directly back to you.
- |
  

- A remote-controlled shock collar will keep the pet at a safe distance.
- IF YOU ENCOUNTER
- "A MOUNTAIN LION:"
- Do not run.
- |
  

- This may trigger the lion's instinct to chase a moving target, because you look like prey.
- |
  

- If you are carrying a Frisbee, now is the time to throw it.
- Try to make yourself appear big and intimidating.
- |
  

- Wave your arms above your head, hold up your backpack, or spread open your coat.
- |
  

- Also, exaggerate your annual income and name-drop as needed.
- Talk to the lion softly.
- |
  

- If the mountain lion tries to engage you in political discussion, gently steer the conversation toward less emotional topics.
- |
  

- Use verbal jujitsu.
- |
  

- Try to preface your remarks with nonconfrontational phrases, such as "Don't you think" or "Maybe I'm wrong, but .
- |
  

- Be straightforward and nonthreatening.
- |
  

- Contrary to popular belief, the use of reverse psychology ("I sure hope you maul me!
- "\") is not effective against mountain lions and will likely antagonize them."
- Ask yourself who in the hiking group most deserves to die.
- |
  

- If you are with children, surely there is one whom you are less attached to.
- |
  

- Maybe the Harry Potter freak who looks alarmingly like the UPS guy.
- |
  

- Among adults, there must be one who would not be sorely missed.
- |
  

- Does someone have a common name like John, Bob, or Mary?
- |
  

- Is someone in the group especially unattractive?
- |
  

- This person should be pushed to the front and offered  as fodder.
- "IF YOU ARE ATTACKED  BY A MOUNTAIN LION:"
- Tuck your head into your chest and cover your face with both arms.
- |
  

- This greatly improves your chances for an open casket.
- Carry a personal item that can be left as a marker.
- |
  

- After killing you, the mountain lion will likely drag your corpse to a secluded spot before feasting on your flesh.
- |
  

- Then smaller animals will continue the process.
- |
  

- Dropping a wallet or a set of keys where you are first attacked will speed the recovery efforts.
- Because medical attention will likely be miles away, be equipped to address the situation yourself.
- |
  

- An iPod, a Game Boy, or pornography will relieve the tedium of your final hours.
- ABOVE ALL, REMEMBER THAT  MOUNTAIN LIONS  ARE TERRITORIAL
- If you are reading this, you are already in their territory.
- |
  

- You can't run fast enough.
- |
  

- There's no hope.
- |
  

- You're history.
- Also, please remember to pack out any trash you generate on your hike.
