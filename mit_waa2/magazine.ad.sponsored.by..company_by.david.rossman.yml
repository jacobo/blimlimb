- So-and-so is always broke.

- The survey that came with a crisp one-dollar bill enclosed for motivation.
- Rich people don't have time to fill out market research surveys.
- |
  

- Rich people keep the dollar and throw away the survey.
- But you.
- |
  

- You carefully filled out the survey, but you lied on almost every question.

- You pretended that your yearly salary was ten times what it is.
- |
  

- You indicated that you purchased two cars, diamond jewelry, and a bicycle last year.
- Did you think, perhaps, that your lies would help support this culturally important magazine with the lagging circulation?

- Perhaps you thought something along the lines of, "If I pretend I'm rich, this fine culturally important magazine will be able to pitch itself to advertisers as a publication with a limited, but sought-after wealthy readership.
- Perhaps it's simpler than that.

- Perhaps you were just fantasizing about what will never be.
- Whatever it is, we're not falling for it.
- And you're still going to have to pay your bills.
- Do you really think a company that has been dealing exclusively with the rich since before your great-grandfather was even born would be taken in by your deceptions?
- Go ahead and say, "I am not rich.
- And try not to forget it.

  Admit It.
  You're not rich.
  You just aren't.
  It's no use looking surprised. Along life's meandering road you meandered even more than most people meander&nbsp;&#151; and substantially more than the kind of people who become rich.

You're thinking about starting to work on your thesis again, but you'd also like to spend more time with your kids.
  Rich people don't whisper about you. They don't even notice you.
  "Normal" people do whisper about you, under their breath, to their friends, and say, "you know, so-and-so, the one who ordered the roast chicken, only contributed nine dollars to the check. And I think so-and-so ordered a beer, too. And when everyone else put in an extra dollar because we were short, so-and-so didn't put in a dollar. So-and-so is always broke. It's getting a little irritating. Have you seen so-and-so's car? My kids make fun of that car."
  Your kind of not being rich is not about being poor. It's not about going hungry. It's not about needing medical attention you can't afford. You're not worthy of a tax-deductible donation.
  "BUT I DON'T FEEL NOT RICH!" you protest. "Why, I read sophisticated magazines like this one. I dress in black. I'm thinking of getting laser vision correction. I know what is in style.
