- I can't put my finger on it, but something about dropping my pipedreams about writing, finishing my cosmetology degree, and opening a little shop here with my friend Keith feels so liberating.
- Have you ever noticed that when you're drinking more than usual and letting your health insurance lapse that, suddenly, every lump, pop, or pain feels terminal?
- I just noticed that the man who stayed here last night has left some money on the kitchen table.

- Deep breath.

- That should come in handy while waiting to see if my other pursuits pan out.
- Whenever I'm feeling down like today, all I do is think of what my friend Tiffany said at Narcotics Anonymous last week.

- She looked at me and said, "I realized when I was writing 'Entertainer' on my tax stuff that dreams can come true if you're willing to chase them.
- Some people, man.

- Mocking tone.

  Have you ever noticed that when you're drinking more than usual and letting your health insurance lapse that, suddenly, every lump, pop, or pain feels terminal?
  I just noticed that the man who stayed here last night has left some money on the kitchen table. [Deep breath.] That should come in handy while waiting to see if my other pursuits pan out.
  Whenever I'm feeling down like today, all I do is think of what my friend Tiffany said at Narcotics Anonymous last week. She looked at me and said, "I realized when I was writing 'Entertainer' on my tax stuff that dreams can come true if you're willing to chase them."
  Some people, man... [Mocking tone.] "We cannot accept the YMCA as a current address. If you've lived somewhere less than two years, you can just give us your last permanent address." Hellloooo? Two years ago I was living at the same YMCA!
  Do you guys have "flaggers" in California? All you do is stand on the corner and raise your hand if you see a police car. Real hard work, right? I was like, "Yeah, I think I can handle it, considering I'm thirty-four-years-old and you're, like... sixteen, dude."
  I have a new phone number. It's a payphone though, and we all use it, so please do me a big favor and try not to sound like a cop when you call.
  Goddamn I.R.S. Can I leave forty grand in cash with you and Mom until like June?
  What is hepatitis, exactly, lungs or liver?
