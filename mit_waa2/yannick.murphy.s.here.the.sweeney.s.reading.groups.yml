- AN EXCERPT FROM
- HERE THEY COME .
- |
  

- We hear our brother violent in his room, angry, knocking over shelves and then taking his mattress off his bed.
- |
  

- We hear him grunting with the effort.
- |
  

- He is pushing his mattress through the open window, a window wide enough to fit the mattress through.
- |
  

- We are taking turns standing on the ladder in the hallway looking over the wall of his room to see the last bit of the green and white striped mattress fitting through the window and then we run to the hallway window, my head and my two sisters' heads and our mother's head side by side hanging out the window watching the mattress fall to the street where cars have to swerve, horns blowing and people pointing up at us.
- |
  

- We step back from the window and our mother says let's go downstairs.
- |
  

- "Jes\xFAs is already there with the freight elevator, already knowing it was our floor the mattress came flying from."
- "\"Don't ask,\""
- |
  

- "Jes\xFAs as we get inside the elevator and Jes\xFAs says he will not ask and Jes\xFAs stares at the peeling paint chip concrete wall falling away from us as we descend."
- In the street we are heroes.
- |
  

- We move the mattress to the sidewalk and a few drivers backed up the whole block long cheer and clap.
- |
  

- The mattress, though, is soiled with dog shit.
- "\"Leave it here,\""
- |
  

- "\"some bum will sleep on it."
- "\" But my sisters and I have already turned the dog shit side down facing the sidewalk and we have jumped on the mattress and are all three laying down on it with our clasped hands held behind our heads and our legs crossed at the ankles."
- "\"The clouds are cloudy,\""
- |
  

- Louisa says and we see what she means, the sky layered with gray clouds and white clouds and puffy ones and streaked ones all at the same time.
- |
  

- We can see no blue.
- "\"Merde,\""
- |
  

- Our brother comes down to the street wearing a blue silk robe that has a Chinese dragon shooting gold thread out of its flaring nostrils.
- |
  

- As he walks past us, the robe's lapels gape and his smooth chest is bared.
- "\"That's from my father,\""
- |
  

- "\"He had no hair there either, and his face never even needed a shave,\""
- |
  

- "\"It's all passed down."
- The traffic starts to lighten on our street as rush hour quiets down and it gets darker.
- |
  

- My mother says let's eat dinner outside.
- |
  

- So she brings down the pot of chicken and rice she has made and our plates and our forks and we set the pot on the curb and she doles us out our portions.
- When we're done we go back up to our place, bringing the plates and the pot and leaving the mattress, now stained with grease since we have wiped our fingers on it.
- "\"We've left our mark,\""
- |
  

- Days later, the mattress is gone and in the paper we read a couple was killed while making love on a mattress in the subway tracks.

- "\"The sound of the roaring train got my girl hot,\""

  layered with gray clouds and white clouds and puffy ones and streaked ones\n\
  all at the same time. We can see no blue.\n\
  \"Merde,\" our mother says and she sits down at the edge of the mattress and\n\
  pulls a cigarette from her breast pocket and lights it with her lighter and\n\
  smokes. Our brother comes down to the street wearing a blue silk robe that\n\
  has a Chinese dragon shooting gold thread out of its flaring nostrils. As he\n\

  \"We've left our mark,\" our mother says and then we all say so long to the\n\
  mattress and wish that the next person who sleeps on it has sweeter dreams\n\
  than the last person.\n\
  Days later, the mattress is gone and in the paper we read a couple was\n\
  killed while making love on a mattress in the subway tracks. \"The sound of\n\
  the roaring train got my girl hot,\" the dying man confessed.\n\
