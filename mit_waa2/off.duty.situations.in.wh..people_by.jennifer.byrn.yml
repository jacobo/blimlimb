- On a Date
- Lisa, when I first observed you, I was promptly alerted to what a beautiful Caucasian individual you are.
- |
  

- Your medium height, civil and polite manner, and fully alert hazel/green eyes indicated to me that you were a pleasant and nonthreatening female citizen.
- |
  

- Initially, it was brought to my attention that you were in the company of another male party, in his mid-20s, and this caused me to abandon my pursuit and exit the premises (Cherry Hill Mall) without incident.
- |
  

- However, you were subsequently spotted on a separate occasion without the male Caucasian party in question.
- |
  

- At this time, I was able to execute a series of maneuvers that enabled me to detain you for a routine exchange of verbal communication.
- |
  

- Upon further questioning, I was able to ascertain that you have been harboring certain feelings for myself.
- |
  

- In light of your confession, I would like to articulate at this time that I am in possession of similar emotions for your person.

- After a Poetry Reading
- The manner in which the individual has rendered these statements, freely and without signs of coercion, leads me to believe that the individual is in possession of moderate quantities of artistic and literary talent.
- |
  

- I further noted on this occasion that the individual verbally articulated items of an explicitly personal and sexual nature.
- |
  

- These confessions were relayed calmly and in nonrhyming verse.
- |
  

- At the conclusion of this incident, it was my determination that this matter warranted further inquiry, so I approached the individual from the left.
- |
  

- Words were exchanged, and it was indicated to me that this particular approach was utilized for purposes described by the party as "subversive galvanization of the soul.
- "\" I suggested at this point in time that the individual might proceed in the future by perpetrating a rhyme of \""

- "\" This advice was politely noted by the individual."

- Nephew's Birthday
- It was my initial assessment that the puppy on the left had been displaying violent behaviors toward the adjacent puppy in this enclosure.
- |
  

- The perpetrator, known here as Puppy A, was observed forcibly biting Puppy B about the head, neck, and hindquarters.
- |
  

- Striking with paws was also noted.
- |
  

- The injuries sustained by Puppy B do not appear to be life-threatening, but warrant ongoing observation.
- |
  

- Puppy A, which appeared to be without remorse for the earlier fisticuffs, then proceeded to excrete feces onto the cranium of Puppy C, which had been quietly occupying the northeastern sector of the aforementioned puppy enclosure.
- |
  

- It was my further observation that this puppy, Puppy A, exhibited a dullness of coat, eyes, and temperament that is characteristic of illicit puppy-tranquilizer use.
- |
  

- I proceeded to question Puppy A regarding the specific behaviors I had observed, as well as the overall manner in which this individual presented its person.
- |
  

- Puppy A indicated to me at this time that he had been in receipt of certain canine anesthetic agents, legal for use by veterinarians, following a neutering operation.
- |
  

- This information was corroborated by other puppies in the enclosure.
- |
  

- I did not note any coercion on the part of Puppy A to elicit this corroboration.
- |
  

- At this time, I opted to secure and transport Puppy A for the purposes of companionship and recreation pertaining to the young nephew of this officer.
