- TOP SECRET
- "Rationale:  Due to the unique threat environment known to exist at POTUS's Crawford, Texas, ranch, the following protocol has been drafted for use in the event of a situation Code: ALICE."
- PHASE ONE
- PREVENTION
- "Education:  POTUS has been cautioned to stay away from abandoned wells while outdoors at the ranch; to watch carefully for wells while clearing brush; to not follow Barney down any holes, no matter how big a rabbit he thinks might be down there; and to avoid stepping in any areas where \"the ground is missing."
- "\" (This language was recommended by the First Lady as most likely to ensure POTUS's comprehension."
- |
  

- "Site Survey:  Crawford-based agents confirm that the ranch grounds have been thoroughly searched for abandoned wells."
- |
  

- However, these searches cannot be considered exhaustive; well-safety experts note that not being able to  see  abandoned wells is the primary reason people fall down them in the first place.
- |
  

- Moreover, agents have reported numerous (seven) sightings of VPOTUS exiting the Crawford property with a shovel.
- |
  

- Thus, continued vigilance is required.
- PHASE TWO
- RAPID RESPONSE
- "Confirm Code: ALICE:  Agents on duty should first verify that POTUS has in fact fallen down a well."
- |
  

- POTUS may simply have tired of clearing brush and gone inside to watch football, or tripped over a rock and forgotten how to get back up.
- |
  

- "Positive indicators of a Code: ALICE situation include (1) physical absence of POTUS aboveground; (2) POTUS faintly asking, with a noticeable echo, \"Hey, how'd it get so dark all of a sudden?"
- "\"; and (3) audible screams or gurgling."
- "Seal and Secure:  Upon confirming Code: ALICE, agents should immediately call for backup to secure the area and cordon off the well to prevent further mishaps."
- |
  

- It is crucial to avoid a repeat of the 1879 constitutional crisis triggered when President Rutherford B. Hayes and Senate President Pro Tempore Allen Thurman fell down the same well.
- "Presidential Well Rescue Squad:  Agents should then promptly notify the professional team of well-victim rescuers maintained on call in Waco whenever POTUS is at the Crawford property."
- |
  

- For identification purposes, the PWRS captains are Gill Norman, who operates the team's extremely large drill; Buck Saunders, who mans the bright light on the very tall crane; and Lorene Sills, who makes coffee for everyone.
- |
  

- All three have top-level security clearances.
- |
  

- Captain Sills is also authorized to provide pie at the conclusion of any rescue effort (blueberry if successful, apple if failed).
- PHASE THREE
- DAMAGE CONTROL
- "Presidential Briefing:  POTUS should be informed that he has fallen down a well."
- |
  

- If he denies that he has fallen down a well, do not contradict him.
- |
  

- POTUS may, for example, claim that he has undertaken a fact-finding mission to determine how to bring democracy to the Edwards Aquifer.
- |
  

- He may insist that he is engaged in discussions with the leaders of the Mole People, calling the talks "constructive.
- "\" He may take a nap."
- |
  

- His physician assures us that POTUS will probably be quite happy in the dark and confining space of an abandoned well.
- |
  

- As always, avoid overburdening him with unnecessary detail.
- "Media Notification:  In the event of a delayed response by the PWRS (they are loath to cut short a canasta game), limited information about the situation should be released to the media."
- |
  

- Reassure reporters that POTUS is still fully capable of performing his duties as president.
- |
  

- Although he is prohibited by statute from negotiating treaties while in a well, he can appoint federal judges at the appellate level and below.
- "Press Availability:  If POTUS's stay in the well is prolonged, interviews may be arranged with historically friendly media outlets."
- |
  

- Talking points issued in advance of any interviews should seek to link Democratic policy initiatives to abandoned wells and, if possible, gravity.
- |
  

- "NB: Under no circumstances should NBC's David Gregory be allowed into the well."
- PHASE FOUR
- AFTERMATH
- "Reintegration:  POTUS may be disoriented after being freed from the well."
- |
  

- "He should be given coffee (if he has napped, he will be cranky) and congratulated on surviving his ordeal, liberating the aquifer, or reaching a d\xE9tente with the Mole People."
- |
  

- It would be helpful to let POTUS sit in the driver's seat of the very tall crane and shine the light around for a while.
- |
  

- Do not let him near the drill.
- "Recalcitrance:  If POTUS has grown too comfortable in the well, he may refuse to come out."
- |
  

- In this case, the First Lady advises that he can be lured out by the promise of a baseball game or a trip to Mars.
- |
  

- POTUS is also conditioned to associate PWRS captain Sills with the smell of pie, and will probably move toward her voice.
- |
  

- Have the nets ready.
- |
  

- "Note: For a fuller description of the First Lady's role in the rescue of the president's family members, see related \"Emergency-Response Protocol 829L: Jenna Falls Into the Reflecting Pool."
