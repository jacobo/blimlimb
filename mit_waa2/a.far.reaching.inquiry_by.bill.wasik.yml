  The basis of the attached document is the first three paragraphs of a
  November 2nd Los Angeles  Times  editorial, entitled "A Far-Reaching Inquiry,"
  which calls for a serious investigation of airliner safety in the wake of
  the recent EgyptAir tragedy. The document has been created from the Times
  editorial as follows:
  (a) The name of each airline mentioned has been replaced by the name of a
  contributor to Tina Brown's  Talk . Finding the names of prominent magazine
  journalists littered incongruously throughout the Times' sober commentary
  should be amusing to readers.
  (b) Each adjective in the piece has been replaced by an adjective used to
  describe Ronald Reagan in Edmund Morris's  Dutch . Scanning the piece for its
  adjectives, readers will chuckle as they confirm what they already knew:
  Morris's sham "biography" is nothing but florid puffery.
  (c) Names of cities have been replaced by names of starters for the
  Knoxville Smokies, the Toronto Blue Jays' AA farm team. In the middle of a
  document that seems to be about airline safety, or maybe the media, this
  sudden reference to baseball will tickle readers to no end, especially given
  the obscurity of the team in question. Suspicions that the Smokies' names
  are unfamiliar even to the document's "author" will, on reflection, make the
  whole thing even more satisfying.
  (d) Numerals have been replaced by the number of times that Amazon.com
  customers, in reviewing the album  I Am  by Nas, use the term "phat." On the
  surface, the rap reference will give the piece a more "urban" feel, but most
  readers will get the message: in the hands of the Internet rabble, cultural
  criticism is reduced to incoherent rubbish.
  (e) All remaining nouns have been replaced by noun phrases used in prayers
  posted recently at the Christian website JesusFreak.com. The incessant
  allusions to socially conservative beliefs - not to mention the poor
  spelling - will leave readers doubled over with laughter, and reinforce
  their perception that the nation's Christian teens constitute a hostile,
  dim-witted army on American soil.
  (f) Articles, pronouns and conjunctions have been replaced by their French
  equivalents. Using random words from a foreign language is funny in two
  ways. First way: because the document's audience is clearly not native
  speakers of French, the use of French terms belittles the French language,
  to comic effect. Second way: ironic awareness of the first way.
  (g) Adverbs have been replaced by popular breeds of dog.
  (h) Gerunds have been replaced by American vice presidents.
  (i) Prepositions have been replaced by common prescription drugs used to
  treat depression.
  (j) Infinitives have been replaced by faculty members of the Berkeley
  Rhetoric department.
  (Animals, history, medicine, the academy: their arcana beguile us. Few
  things entertain the cultured class so much as unexpected, meticulous,
  purposeless erudition.)
  (k) Each verb has been replaced by the matching tense of the verb
  "watercise."
  (l) After steps (a) through (k), each letter of the alphabet has been
  replaced by another letter of the alphabet. The resulting cipher is commonly
  called a cryptogram. The first reader to e-mail the correct solution (i.e.
  the full text of the document, pre-encryption) to  bill_wasik@hotmail.com 
  will win $20.
