- I had this when I came in here.
- |
  

- I did.
- |
  

- Lookit.
- |
  

- I had this the whole time.
- |
  

- It's mine.
- |
  

- I wouldn't have bought it here.
- |
  

- I wouldn't have had to.
- Why are you taking me down here?
- |
  

- I'm not supposed to even be here.
- |
  

- I'm not.
- |
  

- My family is in the chicken business.
- |
  

- We have farms.
- |
  

- We've provided chickens to millions of people.
- |
  

- We're wealthy.
- |
  

- If you've enjoyed the green bean, almond and chicken dinner with Dutch apple crumble &#8212; that's my family.
- |
  

- I'm an heir.
- |
  

- I don't take.
- |
  

- I had this.
- I'm not starting anything.
- |
  

- It was the heat.
- |
  

- I came indoors for some shade.
- |
  

- I could have just stood in the foyer.
- |
  

- But the heat.
- |
  

- Being caught with no ventilation between two glass doors is not refreshing in any way, shape, or form.
- |
  

- Plus, all of your patrons.
- |
  

- I would've been in their way.
- |
  

- In this humid glass tomb.
- |
  

- These chicken dinners my family has lovingly provided for decades, we've made them affordable, so even poor people, if they have a couple dollars and an oven, or reliable source of heat, they can enjoy them.
- I walked in.
- |
  

- I was simply browsing.
- |
  

- You must believe me.
- |
  

- Most of what you provide are just staples.
- |
  

- Bland things.
- |
  

- I'm used to the finer things.
- |
  

- I demand a, no offense, a higher-quality good and service.
- |
  

- Your service is good.
- |
  

- I think I like that one girl.
- |
  

- The one in the smock.
- |
  

- I know you all wear smocks, but I like her.
- |
  

- I just needed shade, because of the weather.
- |
  

- This heat.
- |
  

- This heat could cripple fruit in minutes.
- |
  

- It could turn a healthy peach into soup.
- Don't get me wrong.
- |
  

- I like what you all do.
- |
  

- This store is nice.
- |
  

- Your woman at the register is sweet.
- |
  

- The one in the smock.
- |
  

- I've seen her.
- |
  

- I just&#8230; I normally have plenty of money on hand.
- |
  

- I'm not a shoplifter.
- |
  

- I had this when I came in.
- |
  

- I'm telling you.
- My mother taught us well.
- |
  

- We'd never steal, or even lie.
- |
  

- I remember going to the pool on days like today.
- |
  

- My mother would teach us manners.
- |
  

- Make sure we practiced courtesy.
- |
  

- I could talk about forks and table settings.
- |
  

- I could do this until at least 3:45.
- |
  

- That's how much I know.
- |
  

- Hours of place settings.
- |
  

- I know how to use a pill fork.
- |
  

- I bet you've never even seen one of those.
- |
  

- My family crest is on this chicken package.
- |
  

- It's probably in your freezer with a layer of frost on it.
- |
  

- It's royal blue.
- Lookit.
- |
  

- My driver was at the deli.
- |
  

- Pitt's.
- |
  

- Our limousine is double-parked.
- |
  

- I got out.
- |
  

- I was bored, I suppose.
- |
  

- I do this.
- |
  

- I walked away from the vehicle.
- |
  

- I left his town car idling.
- |
  

- Police on horses were looking after it.
- |
  

- I wanted to visit these shops.
- |
  

- Communicate with the girl in the smock, perhaps.
- |
  

- This heat is something else.
- My driver is getting lemonade crystals at Pitt's.
- |
  

- I gave him a twenty-dollar bill.
- |
  

- Heaven knows lemonade crystals don't go for twenty dollars.
- |
  

- Not now or ever.
- |
  

- I could make lemonade for all of your customers from now until Halloween on twenty dollars.
- |
  

- I don't know why I didn't bring my billfold in here.
- I'm a student.
- |
  

- I'm only here because my mother wanted to see me.
- |
  

- Normally I am away at school for nine months a stretch.
- |
  

- I'm out in Spokane, Washington.
- |
  

- Our chicken plane takes me.
- |
  

- We've a chartered jet aeroplane.
- |
  

- My father uses it.
- |
  

- It's a 7,100 dollar trip when it is all said and done.
- |
  

- He doesn't want me on the commercial flights.
- I'm studying law.
- |
  

- So, just so you know, I wouldn't be doing this.
- |
  

- I'm not sure what it looked like to you, but I had this when I came in here.
- I'd take a glass of tap water if I had to sit here any longer.
- |
  

- Do you suppose I will sit here much longer?
- |
  

- A criminal, I believe, would get sent to the local jail.
- |
  

- If you want to continue this, then you really should just phone the police.
- |
  

- Not that I want you to, just I don't know about this room.
- |
  

- I don't know what I'd do in jail either.
- |
  

- My family slaughters chickens.
- I can't believe you'd keep your files like this.
- |
  

- Those drawers don't close even.
- |
  

- I respect how busy you are, but still.
- |
  

- It's damp down here.
- |
  

- It's just well, it's not so pleasant.
- |
  

- It's moist.
- |
  

- Adult men, moisture wrecks them.
- |
  

- Moisture collects in every fold.
- |
  

- I had this when I came in here.
- Many buildings are full of spores now.
- |
  

- Mold is the last thing to protect against.
- |
  

- No one cares.
- |
  

- It's slow.
- |
  

- My driver is going to have these crystals.
- |
  

- We're expected to bring them back home and get to the business of brewing this lemonade.
- |
  

- We're making lemonade for the family.
- |
  

- My driver won't touch the crystals.
- |
  

- We had a big glass pitcher when I was young.
- |
  

- I filled it with mud and frogs one day.
- |
  

- I don't do that anymore.
- I'm innocent.
- |
  

- My driver is going to be outside.
- |
  

- He'll think I've been abducted.
- |
  

- We had a small picnic in Spokane before I left.
- |
  

- A bonfire.
- |
  

- A roast.
- |
  

- A "Bye-Bye" party. It was a sad little pig. Don't know where they got it. It looked like a fat orange raisin. It was on a spit. It had a bolt through its nose. Someone threw cubed cheese at it.
- The women ignored it and me, and danced around the volleyball net.
- |
  

- This heat is killing me.
- |
  

- Can't you just let me go?
- |
  

- My cousin Travis was punched in the nose by a friend.
- |
  

- Not on purpose.
- |
  

- The friend thought Travis was from a rival school.
- |
  

- It was near the fire.
- |
  

- Just for an instant.
- |
  

- That's all it took.
- That's like this situation, don't you think?
- |
  

- You saw something wrong.
- |
  

- But I had this when I came in here.
- |
  

- There's no receipt, 'cause it's old.
- |
  

- It's like an old friend to me.
- |
  

- Can't you see that you would never sell this here?
- I just couldn't help but wonder why a pig should die and have a bolt through its nose for a picnic.
- |
  

- A lackluster picnic.
- |
  

- That wasn't ushering in good times.
- |
  

- It was because I was flunking out if you must know.
- |
  

- And these people in Spokane were sending me off.
- |
  

- See I am back here for the summer to do good things.
- |
  

- I'm not a thief.
- |
  

- I'm home now for good purposes, not for theft.
