- "\"I'm With Stupid\""
- See how there's an arrow pointing to the side?
- |
  

- The thing underneath "Stupid"? The arrow? Yeah, I know there's no one there. But you're supposed to&#8212;no, no, it doesn't matter that there's no one there right now. Just imagine&#8212;OK, pretend he's with someone, then. It doesn't matter who! Honestly, Mom, it doesn't matter. Anyone. OK, sure, Tom Selleck, then. No, he's not suggesting Tom Selleck is stupid. Oh, I totally agree. One of the best shows of the '80s. Yeah, for sure. Ummm ... Rick, I think? And the black guy was called T.C. I don't know. Tom Courtenay, maybe? I honestly have no idea. Oh, I never thought of that, Mom. You think so? You really think Higgins was Robin Masters? Yeah, I suppose that would make sense.
- "\"I'm not as think as you drunk I am\""
- So you know when you get drunk, and&#8212;whoa, whoa.
- |
  

- No! Of course not!
- |
  

- That's not what I'm saying!
- |
  

- Mom, Mom&#8212;listen.
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- I know, I know.
- |
  

- Three years is a long time, and we're all very proud of you.
- "\"Krap\""
- You're familiar with Kraft, right?
- |
  

- The food company?
- |
  

- Good.
- |
  

- Yeah, so they took the logo from Kraft, and made it into Krap.
- |
  

- See how it's the same, sort of?
- |
  

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- |
  

- What do you mean?
- |
  

- It's funny because the company's called Kraft, and they made it Krap.
- |
  

- Like they took a popular brand name, and made it into a swear word.
- |
  

- Yeah, sure, I think you can say "crap" on TV. It's not a big deal. Yeah, they used to say "bitch" on  NYPD Blue  all the time.
- |
  

- Oh, I don't know about that one&#8212;maybe only in Canada.
- |
  

- Yeah, they're tougher on that stuff down there.
- |
  

- What's that?
- |
  

- Mom, I can't hear you.
- |
  

- Stop whispering, I can't&#8212;Mom!
- |
  

- Easy!
- |
  

- Easy with the blue language, we're not&#8212;oh, no, that lady over there is looking at us.
- |
  

- Don't look now!
- |
  

- Mother.
- |
  

- Please.
- |
  

- This is the worst.
- |
  

- This is the absolute worst, ever.
- "\"I found Jesus&#8212;He was behind the couch  the whole time \""
- OK.
- |
  

- I know you're not religious.
- |
  

- But you are aware, are you not, that there are people who&#8212;figuratively&#8212;"find Jesus"? What? Oh, those are quotation marks. It's like, you do the quotation-marks sign with your fingers when something's figurative, or ironic, or whatever. God, Mom, I have no idea. Just go with it, OK? Listen&#8212;can we start again? Good. Thank you. So there are certain Christian people who&#8212;no. OK, I've got it. When a Christian person really gets in touch with God, they claim they've found Jesus. And sometimes they ask other people, "Have you found Jesus?
- "\" What now, Mom?"
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- No! You don't do the quotation-marks thing when you quote somebody, not when you're talking.
- |
  

- I have no idea!
- |
  

- You just don't.
- |
  

- Well, maybe you don't make very much sense, either.
- "\"Beaver Patrol\""
- Hey, look, a shoe sale!
- |
  

- You love shoe sales!
- "\"Gary Coleman for Governor of California\""
- OK, this one is ironic.
- |
  

- Like, it's sort of making fun of Gary Coleman.
- |
  

- Yeah, from  Diff'rent Strokes .
- |
  

- No, that was  Webster .
- |
  

- Some disease where they look like kids all their lives, or something.
- |
  

- Well, I think their life expectancy is limited, so maybe not.
- |
  

- Stick with the wrinkle cream and pilates, Mom.
- |
  

- OK.
- |
  

- Now, the T-shirt.
- |
  

- I think he actually did run for governor, and if people voted for him it was probably a joke.
- |
  

- I don't know what his platforms were.
- |
  

- Well, because he's a former TV star, and he's small, and on  Diff'rent Strokes  he always used to say&#8212;yeah, right.
- |
  

- Jeez, Mom, you actually do that really well.
- |
  

- So I guess it would have been funny.
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- Yeah, last year.
- |
  

- Hmmm .
- |
  

- I don't know.
- |
  

- I never saw any.
- |
  

- Although maybe that is how Schwarzenegger got in.
- "\"Firemen Have Big Hoses\""
- Why are you giggling?
- |
  

- It's not even funny.
- |
  

- Mom.
- |
  

- Seriously.
- |
  

- It's a lame joke.
- |
  

- It's so easy&#8212;"Firemen Have Big Hoses.
- "\" I mean, come on."
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- Oh, I don't know.
- |
  

- Are you serious?
- |
  

- I just don't do that sort of stuff&#8212;big-penis humor.
- |
  

- I wouldn't even know where to start.
- |
  

- Oh, good one.
- |
  

- I'll write that down.
- |
  

- I don't even think policemen's guns are that big, to be quite honest.
- |
  

- Mailmen?
- |
  

- Mom, no one finds mailmen sexy.
- |
  

- Don't.
- |
  

- I know what you're thinking, but don't.
- |
  

- Oh, God.
- |
  

- Mom!
- |
  

- If I ever thought I'd hear my mother say, "
- Big sacks.
- "\" What?"
- |
  

- The quotation marks?
- |
  

- I had to do them that time.
- |
  

- I don't want you putting words in my mouth.

Rick, I think? And the black guy was called T.C. I don't know. Tom Courtenay, maybe? I honestly have no idea. Oh, I never thought of that, Mom. You think so? You really think Higgins was Robin Masters? Yeah, I suppose that would make sense.
