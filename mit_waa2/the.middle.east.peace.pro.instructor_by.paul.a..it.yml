- Tom Cochrane.
- Happy Saturday, everyone!
- |
  

- I'm so glad you're here!
- Remember, you are here for  you .
- |
  

- Not for me, not for the person across the bargaining table, not for anyone else in the conference room.
- This time is for  you  and  you  alone!
- We'll begin with some simple negotiations to warm up our bargaining muscles.
- Life  is  a highway, and every highway has a road map.
- |
  

- So let's all take out our road maps.
- To the tune of
- "\"Hot Blooded\""
- |
  

- Foreigner.
- Now we're entering some rolling hills.
- |
  

- We're beginning to work a little harder now, getting our heart rates elevated.
- You should be bargaining at a 6 or 7 out of 10.
- |
  

- If you are bargaining at a 4 or a 5, pick up the pace.
- |
  

- If you are bargaining harder than that, back off a little bit.
- |
  

- You don't want to injure yourself or bonk out early.
- Let's see who's ready to do some work.
- |
  

- Is anyone out there ready to work?
- How about we start with an effective cease-fire?
- |
  

- Has anyone got an effective cease-fire for me?
- |
  

- Israel Defense Forces?
- |
  

- Yes!
- |
  

- Hamas?
- |
  

- Yes!
- |
  

- Fatah?
- |
  

- PLO?
- Now we're working!
- To the tune of
- "\"The Final Countdown\""
- |
  

- Europe.
- OK, folks, we're approaching a wicked big hill, and we're going to be doing our hardest bargaining for the next 4 minutes and 54 seconds.
- |
  

- You should be bargaining at a 9 or even a 10 if you can.
- |
  

- You should be giving everything you've got during this climb.
- This is your time to work.
- |
  

- Let's get those thorny issues out on the table!
- Israel, how about it?
- |
  

- Can we talk about ceasing settlement expansions?
- |
  

- Work it!
- |
  

- "Can we talk about refugees\x82 right of return?"
- |
  

- Work it!
- Palestinian Authority, I see you sweating!
- |
  

- Can we accept Israel's right to exist?
- |
  

- Can we accept existing Jewish settlements in disputed territories?
- |
  

- Push it!
- |
  

- I want to see you giving 110 percent!
- Islamic Jihad is working it!
- |
  

- Who else is working it?
- |
  

- Oh, I see you, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine!
- |
  

- Who else?
- |
  

- I didn't forget about you, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine!
- |
  

- And I see Fatah and I see Hamas!
- |
  

- Great work, guys!
- |
  

- So how about it?
- |
  

- Can we talk about an end to the intifada and a renunciation of armed resistance?
- I can see the crest of the hill up ahead!
- |
  

- Get up, get up, get your butts out of those saddles and push to the top!
- |
  

- Don't give up now.
- |
  

- We're almost there!
- To the tune of
- "\"The Best\""
- |
  

- Tina Turner.
- Now we're headed for the finish line.
- |
  

- We're headed home.
- The hard work is done.
- |
  

- It's time to relax a little and enjoy the ride.
- Feel the wind in your hair, feel the sun on your face.
- You bargained hard today.
- Give yourselves a hand.
- |
  

- You deserve it.
- And please don't forget to wipe down the equipment when you're done.
