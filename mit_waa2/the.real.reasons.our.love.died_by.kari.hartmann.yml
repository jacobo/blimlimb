- "Dan:"
- "While visiting your home, I discovered a pincher-bug colony under your bed\x97one you had never noticed."
- |
  

- I knew then that it was over, because how could you not know there was a bug colony in your bedroom?
- |
  

- But, at the time, I said it was "because I need to concentrate on school.
- |
  

- "Todd:"
- One morning, while I was using your bathroom, I happened to get a pair of your soiled boxers  stuck to my foot  because they were, uh, soiled.
- |
  

- I was too embarrassed to say anything, so I blamed our breakup on an allergic reaction to your cat.
- |
  

- "Roger:"
- I came face to face with your mother and her long white gloves.
- |
  

- I believe I actually did reveal the truth of this breakup, but you didn't realize at the time that the picture I drew on that cocktail napkin of your mother making me cry wasn't a caricature.
- |
  

- "Leonard:"
- I thought a boyfriend who liked to smoke when he was tipsy was cute in a '90s-type way, until I realized you were the drunk kissy-snuggle type who didn't see the need for showering after smoking an entire pack of cigarettes.
- |
  

- "Scott:"
- "The real reason we broke up is that I discovered you were engaged to be married when I picked up the phone one day and took a message from  your fianc\xE9e ."
- |
  

- You may not have heard me clearly, but I was screaming obscenities at you as I left.
- |
  

- "Ned Cooper Brill D'Amato:"
- Your last name, and all potential hyphenated variants thereof, frightened me.
- |
  

- "Mike D.:"
- I think I told you at the time that I wasn't interested in getting serious, but what I meant was "I'm not ready to get serious with a guy who doesn't like dogs and who constantly 'forgets' his wallet when we go out.
- |
  

- "Mike T.:"
- Your penis had a birthmark that brought to mind Satan's horns and staff.
- |
  

- "Jeffrey:"
- "Your inability to calculate a tip or divide a group meal into fair shares\x97that drove me crazy."
- |
  

- Whatever else I said was a bald-faced lie.
- |
  

- "Marcus:"
- It was your sudden admission that it was my feet that first attracted you.
- |
  

- And it feels good to finally admit that.
