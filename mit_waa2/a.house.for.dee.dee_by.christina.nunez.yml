  Thank you, it's a pleasure to be here. When people ask me what I am
  proudest of in my life, I think they expect to hear something about that
  
  job I held in Washington a few years ago!
  [chuckles] Thank you. I certainly enjoyed the challenges of being
  Clinton's
  press secretary, but these days I face a much more "pressing" task, and
  it
  has given me moments prouder than any I ever experienced at the White
  House. It is the challenge of being spokesperson for a public figure
  even
  greater than the president of the United States.
  In some ways, He's an easier boss: There are no interns to worry about,
  no
  haircut expenses to justify  and no outspoken wife to mollify. No,
  there's no spin necessary on Jesus: so many have already elected him
  their savior, and I am going to keep
  delivering the Word until all Americans have cast a vote for the only
  leader they can really trust.
  Last year, I spoke with Mike McCurry as he was in the midst of the
  impeachment crisis. I called him up and said, "Mike, how are you doing?"
  And he said, "Dee Dee, sometimes I don't know how I can face them." I
  asked
  him if he had faced Jesus. I said, "Mike, as long as you have a personal
  
  relationship with God, no statement you make will be misleading." I
  urged
  him to consult the Bible instead of the agenda.
  In his characteristically guarded but lovable way, Mike said, "Dee Dee,
  I'm
  sorry, but I've got to go into this briefing. Can we talk about this
  later?" And he may not hear it from me, but you can bet that Mike--just
  like all of us--will certainly be "talking about this later," whether it
  is
  tomorrow or the next day or at the ultimate press conference, Judgment
  Day.
  If you think Sam Donaldson is a tough interrogator, you ain't seen
  nothin'
  yet! [laughter]
  For it is sometimes hard to imagine that there is a house larger and
  more
  powerful than the White House or any building humans could create. It is
  
  the house of the Lord, and there, the microphone at the podium is always
  
  on. Thank you.
