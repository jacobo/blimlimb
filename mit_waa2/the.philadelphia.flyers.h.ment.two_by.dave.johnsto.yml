- Outside the locked gates of Compiegne, Jeanne D'Arc stood alone on a hilltop, surrounded by the broken remnants of her French army, the many dead scattered, the living limping from the battlefield.
- |
  

- Shivering, she watched a detachment of the enemy Burgundian cavalry riding across the valley toward her.
- |
  

- She took no notice of the solitary figure who climbed the hill behind her.
- "\"High-five!"
- "\" shouted Todd Fedoruk, big-boned left-winger for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League."
- Jeanne D'Arc did not meet his eager gaze.
- |
  

- Instead, her eyes followed the men who had once been under her command&#8212;her loyal men&#8212;as they ran from her, ripping the crosses from their tunics, trying desperately to distance themselves from the defeat and from her.
- |
  

- So many men lost, and so little gained.
- |
  

- Again she looked toward the Burgundian cavalry, now disappearing momentarily behind a stand of apple trees.
- "\"Don't leave me hanging!"
- "\" Fedoruk insisted, his face suddenly in front of hers, his hand waving enthusiastically."
- She had not mentioned it to her lieutenants, but God had not left her any messages in a month.
- |
  

- This defeat, this final defeat, the decision to come to Compiegne was her choice.
- |
  

- A tear rolled down her dirty cheek.
- |
  

- She didn't cry for herself; she was already lost.
- |
  

- The tear was for her allies and enemies, the many lives ended.
- "\"What are you crying about?"
- "\" Todd Fedoruk asked, lowering his high-fiving hand."
- |
  

- "\"Here, sit down for a second on this dead horse."
- Jeanne D'Arc instead chose a small, flat rock still wet from the morning dew.
- "\"You have nothing to be ashamed of,\""
- |
  

- Fedoruk said, patting her on the shoulder.
- |
  

- "\"You totally kicked ass."
- |
  

- You left it all on the field.
- |
  

- Look at you, you're totally wiped.
- |
  

- Nobody could ask any more of you.
- |
  

- They asked you for 110 percent, you gave them 120, lady.
- The Burgundians reached the bottom of the hill, their horses circling and pawing at the air.
- "\"Sure, you lost today."
- |
  

- But you'll get them next year,"
- |
  

- Fedoruk, who had a poor grasp of history, added.
- |
  

- Jeanne D'Arc stood up and roughly wiped the tear into nothingness.
- |
  

- There were no regrets for her.
- |
  

- She had done God's work.
- "\"Haut-cinq,\""
- |
  

- "\"OK!"
- "\" yelped Fedoruk, slapping it lustily."
- |
  

- "\"Now, way up high!"
- |
  

- Come on!
- |
  

- This hand is not going to high-five itself!
- Finally, the Burgundians rode over the crest of the hill, their eyes cruel and grimly set.
- Luckily for Jeanne D'Arc, the cavalry had arrived.
