- The way I see it, Lloyd is crazy.
- |
  

- Not just short-pants-in-winter kinda crazy but batshit kinda crazy.

- |
  

- That's the way I see it.

- Not necessarily playing Neil Young tunes on the guitar, either.
- |
  

- Do your job, for change, in front of the 17th Avenue liquor store.
- |
  

- Then go back to work and complain about having to share an office.
- |
  

- Be the person you always wanted to be.

- |
  

- Burnt poop.
- |
  

- If you love someone, set them free.
- |
  

- If they come back, make sure you get the money they owe from before you set them free.
- |
