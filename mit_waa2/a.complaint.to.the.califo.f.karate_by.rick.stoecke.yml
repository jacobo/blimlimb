- After seeing Daniel LaRusso take home the trophy last year at the All Valley Tournament, I am inspired to switch dojos so I can train with Mr. Miyagi.
- |
  

- Previously, I was a member at Cobra Kai Karate.
- |
  

- While there, I earned my purple belt.
- I am in dojo shock when I discover that Mr. Miyagi does not use colored belts to mark advanced levels of study.
- |
  

- His training is also vastly different from the training I received at Cobra Kai.
- |
  

- During the first few weeks, Mr. Miyagi has me wax his classic cars, paint his house, sand his porch, and mend his fence.
- |
  

- I am suspicious, to say the least.
- |
  

- However, when I challenge him about his methods, he attacks me.
- |
  

- As I fend off his blows, I discover I have gained blocking skills I was not even aware of.
- Mr. Miyagi tells me to withdraw $1,000 from my bank account and arrive early the next morning.
- |
  

- I show up, and he instructs me to take each $20 bill, thrust it forward, and place it in his palm.
- |
  

- If I do not perform the motion to his liking, he makes me take the 20 back and repeat the motion until I execute it perfectly.
- |
  

- After five minutes, all the money is in his palm.
- |
  

- He asks if he can borrow it.
- |
  

- I agree, partly because I am grateful for what he has taught me, and partly because he has already placed the money in his pocket and walked away.
- |
  

- After that morning, I do not see Mr. Miyagi for a week, but he left a detailed list of chores for me to do, such as mowing his yard, weeding his garden, reshingling his roof, and building him a gazebo.
- "When he returns, he informs me that he went to Canc\xFAn for spring break."
- |
  

- I ask him to help me with some new moves I was learning during his absence.
- |
  

- He vomits into his shrubs, which I had just spent hours trimming, and passes out under the California sun.
- I show up to his house the next day.
- |
  

- He still looks hung-over.
- |
  

- I ask him if he can return the money he borrowed.
- |
  

- He tells me he will fix my bike for me.
- |
  

- "\"Then we even, Ricky san."
- "\" I tell him I just want the money back."
- I think about returning to Cobra Kai.
- |
  

- I have mixed emotions about their "no mercy" policy. At least Sensei John Kreese never borrowed money from me, except that time he needed 15 cents for a Snickers out of the vending machine in the Cobra Kai locker room.
- I tell Miyagi I want to win the next All Valley Tournament.
- |
  

- He laughs and pokes me with a chopstick.
- |
  

- When he sees I am serious, he tells me karate is not for winning trophies, it is for defending one's life.
- |
  

- I say fine, and ask him to pay me back the money I gave him.
- |
  

- He mentions fixing my bicycle again.
- |
  

- I tell him I don't have a damn bike.
- |
  

- "He is adamant, though: \"I make any bike Miyagi Turbo."
- "\" Finally, after I hammer home the idea that no bike bartering is going to happen here, he agrees to coach me in the All Valley."
- The day of the tournament, he doesn't show.
- |
  

- In my first fight, I try to wax on, wax off.
- |
  

- That doesn't help when the guy is roundhouse-kick-onning and roundhouse-kick-offing my face.
- |
  

- I am down and out.
- |
  

- I spot Miyagi in the crowd; his lips are around a bottle of sake.
- |
  

- I learn that no motion you do while building an English-garden-style gazebo will help you score a point in a karate match.
- In my next match, I am seriously injured by my opponent.
- |
  

- I can barely move my left leg.
- |
  

- Miyagi comes to my side, smelling of booze and suntan lotion.
- |
  

- "\"Rest, Ricky san,\""
- |
  

- He starts to massage my leg, but I soon realize he is just patting me down for money.
- |
  

- He gets nervous and tells me to "always look eye.
- "\" I push him away and tell him he's an idiot for thinking I'd keep my wallet in my gi while fighting a karate match."
- |
  

- He asks me where my real pants are, and then, after a minute of silence, walks off.
- |
  

- As I get dressed, I can see him peeking over the lockers, watching for where I have stowed my wallet.
