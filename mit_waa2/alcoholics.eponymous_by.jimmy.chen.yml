- Look at what we have done to this poor lady; she even ripped her pants.
- |
  

- "Oh, I have seen many things in my days: the sullen look of a jaded 14-year-old lover, a brick of peat moss buttered in the final notes of a summer sunset, an oak barrel swollen with solemn unsung years ."
- |
  

- I brave to tread the path less traveled, twirl my cane amidst the havoc and chaos of modernity.
- |
  

- "We, suspended in this age of excess, brine our livers in nectared poison with self-delusional love and irrevocable loneliness, for true love\x97the kind that shines so bright its white rays burst your retinas\x97is but a lost notion quivering toward the past."
- "ALL: ( Silence."

- "GREY GOOSE: My bad."
