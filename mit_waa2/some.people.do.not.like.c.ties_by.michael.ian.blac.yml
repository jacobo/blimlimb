  Some people just don't like me. I know this is hard to believe, especially when you consider the following:
  
    I am a celebrity (very famous). 
   I give sixty percent of my income to "Jerry's Kids." 
   I hardly ever kick my dog.
  Two of these things are true, and shouldn't that be enough to ensure me a large measure of goodwill from my fellow man? After all, I harbor no ill will towards anybody (except for that motherfucker Paul Newman&nbsp;&#8212; he knows why).
  This is why it was so surprising for me to learn that there are people out there, people I have never even met, who do not like me.
  I first became aware of this after appearing on the VH1 television program,  I Love the 70's.  You may have seen this show. According to the VH1 press release, it's a "fun-filled ride through the music, movies, TV shows, products, fashions, fads, trends and major events that defined pop culture each year of the decade." Whatever. They paid me two grand.
  For people who feel the need to share their thoughts about television shows with complete strangers, VH1 maintains an internet message board.
