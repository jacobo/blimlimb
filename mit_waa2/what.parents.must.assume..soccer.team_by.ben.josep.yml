- "Lucky break, Tigers\x97I talked to the ref and, for the next five minutes, we get a point every time we blow all the seeds off a dandelion in a single try."
- |
  

- Go, Jenny, go!
- |
  

- James, I don't care if your father played soccer at Duke.
- |
  

- It's my job to make sure you're a huge disappointment to him.
- |
  

- Now pretend you're a magic airplane or else.
- |
  

- Nelson, watch out!
- |
  

- The ball is now a horrible, child-eating monster and the only way to defeat it is by running away and crying.
- |
  

- Ralph!
- |
  

- Hear me raise my voice slightly?
- |
  

- Your parents need to come over and explain my shortcomings as a coach and a person.
- |
  

- Timmy!
- |
  

- Nice aggression.
- |
  

- I support your decision to give that kid a bloody nose, and you should resolve conflicts similarly at school and at home.
- |
  

- Nice half, guys!
- |
  

- "Remember, a true soccer player saves his energy for the sprint to the sideline\x97especially since I only have enough juice boxes for half of you."
- |
  

- Now, Christian, we're all about to make assumptions about your future sexuality, so make sure to run that way we practiced.
- |
  

- Tigers!
- |
  

- I'm sure you'd never notice on your own, so I'll point out the apple-juice stain on Tim's crotch that looks suspiciously like urine.
- |
  

- Stop what you're doing right now and laugh till he cries.
- |
  

- Nelson, don't panic, but that monster's back.
- |
  

- Put your hands in your pants and pretend not to see it and you may survive.
- |
  

- Good game, guys.
- |
  

- "Remember: It doesn't matter whether you win or lose."
- |
  

- What matters is that you all played worse than the Joneses' kid.
