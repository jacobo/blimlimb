- You ever wonder where road signs come from?
- |
  

- It all starts with the writer.
- |
  

- That writer is me.
- |
  

- I'm Chip Tusken.
- |
  

- I write signs.
- |
  

- Because somebody has to.
- "\" RIGHT LANE MUST TURN RIGHT \""
- |
  

- Me.
- |
  

- "\" EXIT ONLY \""
- |
  

- That came out of this brain.
- |
  

- "\" NO PARKING 10 AM TO 12 NOON MONDAY STREET CLEANING, NO PARKING 6 PM TO 8 AM MON THRU SAT, 2 HR PARKING 8 AM TO 6 PM MON THRU SAT, NO PARKING 12 AM TO 3 AM TAXI ZONE, VEHICLES WITH DISTRICT NO."
- |
  

- PERMITS EXEMPTED "
- |
  

- That's my  Ulysses .
- I can't claim credit for every sign.
- |
  

- My grandpa wrote " STOP .
- "\" Talent runs in the family."
- The Tuskens have written signs for every strip of pavement from the New Jersey Turnpike to the San Diego Freeway.
- |
  

- Know why they call it the San Diego Freeway?
- |
  

- Because my dad wrote the sign over it that says " SAN DIEGO FUCKING FREEWAY .
- Now, when someone needs a sign, they come to me.
- |
  

- I'm the brains behind it all.
- |
  

- An artist.
- |
  

- A creative.
- |
  

- I don't actually construct the sign.
- |
  

- There are some very skilled grunts who do that.
- |
  

- They are no better than trained beasts, but I'm grateful to them, because they make me look good, and I'm terrified of machinery.
- Most people love my work unquestioningly.
- |
  

- Once, though, I wrote a sign and the client was inexplicably outraged.
- |
  

- "He showed up in my office\x97the nerve, my own office!"
- |
  

- "\"This says ' SPEED LIMIT 85 ,'\""
- |
  

- "\"The speed limit is supposed to be 15."
- "\"I wasn't feeling 15,\""
- |
  

- I replied as politely as could be expected.
- "\"It's a school zone,\""
- |
  

- "\"I don't recall writing that,\""
- |
  

- I told him.
- "\"Well, it is."
- |
  

- "There is a school\x97\""
- "\"Look, if you want some sellout who's just going to tell you what you want to hear, fine."
- |
  

- There are plenty of hacks out there, so go hire one, you pathetic worm,"
- |
  

- I bellowed, making sure to let some spittle fly in his face.
- |
  

- Not so much that it would be obvious that I had done it on purpose, but enough to make him suspect that I had, and feel awful about himself later for letting it slide.
- "\"Do you think I need you?"
- "\" I continued."
- |
  

- "\"Do you think I don't have hundreds of guys just like you lining up, begging me, willing to pay any price to have me write their signs?"
- |
  

- Because I do.
- |
  

- Do you know why this state is bankrupt?
- |
  

- Because they gave all their money to me to write signs.
- |
  

- "Every one of my signs is a fucking original, and I charge 2 million per sign\x97plus exponentially increasing royalties for reproductions\x97and each one is worth every goddamn penny."
- "\"But\x97,\""
- |
  

- "I steamrolled over him: \"You want to talk to me about speed limits?"
- |
  

- What do you know about limits?
- |
  

- I  push  the limits.
- |
  

- I challenge people.
- |
  

- Are you uncomfortable with this sign?
- |
  

- Good.
- |
  

- I  want  you to be uncomfortable.
- |
  

- I want you to ask yourself the tough questions, and I want the answers to make you cry.
- |
  

- If you read my signs and don't wish you were dead, I've failed.
- |
  

- And  that's  why people love my work.
- He was shaking now, pitiful, weak, unsure of what to do.
- |
  

- I let my words hang in the air meaningfully as I grabbed the wrist of a nearby gorgeous girl, pulled her close, kissed her deeply while cupping her left breast, then cast her aside roughly.
- |
  

- She tumbled over my desk and crashed to the floor.
- |
  

- A moment later, she stood up, pleasantly dazed, and flashed an appreciative smile.
- |
  

- Her nose was bleeding, but somehow it only made her more beautiful as she staggered out the door.
- |
  

- I had never seen her before and would never see her again.
- "\"What's my daughter doing here?"
- "\" said the sad little man before me."
- I slapped his face.
- |
  

- "\"Get the hell out of my office."
- The sign was installed the next day.
