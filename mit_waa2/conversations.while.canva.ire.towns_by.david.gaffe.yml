  A LARGE HOME IN HAMPTON, ON THE COAST:
  Me: Hi. Is that a coonhound?
  Man at Door: Yes, it is. He dug that hole over there yesterday in about two 
  minutes.
  Me: Well, I'm here canvassing for Bill Bradley, and I wanted to give you the 
  latest literature we've got.
  Man at Door: I'm voting for Bill Bradley. When George Bush Sr.was here 10 
  years ago, he couldn't get out of this state fast enough. If Jesus himself 
  showed up here and was running for President as a Republican, I wouldn't  
  support him, because 10 years ago, we were starving.

  IN A BAR IN NASHUA.
  Me: So I'll give you my email address.
  Female Rutgers University Student #1 to #2: What's up?
  Student #2 to #1: We're getting digits.
  Student #2, to me, raising her eyebrows and smiling: I don't have a pen. I 
  have lip liner.
  Student #1, to #2: He has a fiancee. No lip liner.

  A RESTSTOP IN CONNECTICUT, SUNDAY EVENING.
  Me: You have batteries?

  employees, we have a Code 2.
  Me, to a friend: Hospitable place.
  Clerk: Will the bus driver of the Greyhound bus please approach the front of 
  the building?
