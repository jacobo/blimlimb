- I have big dreams.

- My wife took our daughter Ruth with her.

- I used to call my daughter "Babe" and told her she'd hit about a million homeruns.
- Though war appalls me I'm an avid supporter of women's lib, kettle drums and State's Rights.

- Every year I read Homer's Iliad cover to cover.
- Long time ago I owned a '48 International.

- I rolled that truck into a pond when I didn't quite make the curve around Kerley's Corners.

- I still think about my truck when I take Guernsey for long walks past the pond.

- Maybe one day I'll throw in a line and pluck a few bass up off those sunken running boards.
- I have a girlfriend named Linda.

- She's got a good job with the phone company.

- We met when I spent all my money on a new Casio recorder and she turned off my service.

- She drops by the trailer, and we drink virgin pina coladas and play Chinese checkers.

- I don't mind the company but I wonder sometimes, does Linda know the real me?
- When I finish my symphony, I'm going to save my disability checks and have my truck dredged from the pond.
- |
  

- Then I'll drive north and find Ruth, who's somewhere in Vermont the last I heard.
- |
  

- I'll lean on a chain-link fence, smoke weed, and watch my daughter hit one homerun after another.
- |
  

- I picture it being twilight while she's hitting her homeruns.
- |
  

- And there's a mountain in the background.
- |
  

- I have these big dreams.
