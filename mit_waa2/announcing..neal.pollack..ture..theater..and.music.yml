  JULY 26-27 
  PHILADELPHIA, PA
  Because no magazine is complete without a festival to celebrate itself, and
  because we believe that festivals are fun and should include drinking beer,
  and, because, let's face it, our ambition knows no earthly bounds, we are
  announcing a celebration of all things new and exciting in literature. This
  festival will be held in Philadelphia, PA, the birthplace and first capital
  of our nation, and still a great city with a very entertaining
  basketball team.
  All reading events are free. The music events will, it looks like, cost $8
  the first night and $10 the second night.  The cost for both nights
  together will be $15, if you buy a wristband at the door on the first night.
  At some
  point there will also be a live epic battle between good and evil, but we are
  not yet sure where and when. Books will be on sale at the library event,
  courtesy of Joseph Fox Booksellers, an excellent independent bookstore and a
  proud member of the McSweeneys 100.
  The special tours of the Rosenbach Museum and Library will be at 2 PM on
  Thursday the 26th and 11 AM on Friday the 27th.  Interested parties should

  reserve a space, as each tour is limited to 15 people.  Admission to the
  Rosenbach is $5.

  New Jersey to attend this festival, but we also want to extend a welcoming
  hand of brotherly love to anyone from the New York area, from the Washington,
  D.C./Baltimore area, from Wilmington, Delaware, and from anywhere else on the
  eastern seaboard. Philly is close, and getting there inexpensive. You will
