- Jesus said, "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
- |
  

- The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
- |
  

- But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
- |
  

- The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.
- One of the disciples asked, "What of the man who builds his house inside the house built on the rock?
- |
  

- Surely his house will be even less damaged by water and wind.
- |
  

- Is this what we should do?
- And Jesus said, "No, don't do that.
- |
  

- At that time a man said unto Jesus, "Jesus!
- |
  

- I do not understand the nature of the kingdom of heaven.
- Jesus said, "The Father's kingdom is like a shepherd who had a hundred sheep.
- |
  

- One of them went astray.
- |
  

- He left the 99 and looked for the one until he found it.
- |
  

- When it was found, he said to the sheep, 'That you went astray is a clear sign that you misunderstand my instructions.
- |
  

- You are nothing to me.
- |
  

- And then the shepherd turned the lost sheep into a pillar of salt, because the shepherd is God in this parable, and that's the sort of thing He does when people fail to understand His Word.
- "\"Wait, what?"
- "\" said the man,"
- And the man became a pillar of salt.
- |
  

- Then Jesus said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.
- |
  

- Then the one inside answers, 'OK, just gimme a minute,' and he goes to one of his friends, and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, because a friend of a friend of mine on a journey has come to the friend who's my friend, and that friend has nothing to set before his friend.
- |
  

- One of the disciples said, "Wait, doesn't the original person's friend need three loaves of bread because a friend of his friend who's on a journey has come to the friend of the original person's friend, and that friend has nothing to set before his first friend?
- |
  

- Or is that what you just said?
- "\"It doesn't matter,\""
- |
  

- Jesus.
- |
  

- "\"The point is that God can get you free bread."
- |
  

- "\"But what do you think about this?"
- "\" asked Jesus."
- |
  

- "\"A man with two sons told the older boy, 'Son, go out and work in the vineyard today."
- |
  

- The son answered, 'No, I won't go,' but later he changed his mind and went anyway.
- |
  

- Then the father told the other son, 'You go,' and he said, 'Yes, sir, I will.
- |
  

- But he didn't go.
- |
  

- Which of the two was obeying his father?
- "\"The first!"
- "\" cried some of the disciples."
- "\"The second!"
- "\" cried the rest of the disciples."
- And Jesus said, "Wait, I messed this one up.
- |
  

- Did I mention that when the first son went to work in the vineyard he killed somebody?
- |
  

- Because that's important.
- |
  

- So, yeah, which of the two was obeying his father?
- "\"Uh ."
- |
  

- "\" said some of the disciples."
- "\"The second!"
- |
  

- The second!
- "\" cried the rest of the disciples."
- And Jesus said, "Oh, cripes, also the father only has one arm.
- |
  

- And he is riding a horse the whole time.
- |
  

- Was that clear?
- One of the disciples said, "Are you sure that's not 'The Parable of the One-Armed Father Who Rode on a Horse'?
- And Jesus said, "Maybe you're right.
- |
  

- "OK, let's change the question: Which of the two sons was the tallest?"
- The disciples were silent.
- Jesus shook his head in dismay.
- |
  

- "\"Have I taught you nothing?"
- |
