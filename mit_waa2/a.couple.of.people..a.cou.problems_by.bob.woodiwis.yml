- "We've attained this state through what we call the Four \"Com\"s: strong  com mitment, honest  com munication, willingness to  com promise, and separate  com bs. Still, there have been rough spots, periods when love was not enough and masturbation could not pick up the slack. During those times, times when our love shack was engulfed in flames, we have turned to the therapeutic fire ax known as couples counseling."

- We'd only been together a short while, a few months or, possibly, years.

- "I became insanely jealous of the love and attention she was showering\x97literally!"
- |
  

- Her melancholy and my suspicions festered for weeks before finally erupting into a colossal row that, with time, ratcheted down to a nasty fight, then cooled to a heated argument, which mutated into a frank discussion, which segued into a frothy dialogue that we eventually added a few songs to and took on the road to great reviews.

- But over the course of those exchanges it became clear to both of us that we'd disconnected somewhere along the way.

- At first, I blamed myself, but that didn't feel quite right, so, instead, I started blaming the media, which did.

- Unwilling to embrace this painless remedy, Sophia asserted that if we were ever to fully regain what we once had we would need the help and guidance of an impartial third party.

- By this time, Sophia was traveling frequently for her work (at some point, she'd become a very successful fly-someplace, do-something-there person) while I sat, home- and deskbound, stymied in my attempts to write the first novel-length novella.
