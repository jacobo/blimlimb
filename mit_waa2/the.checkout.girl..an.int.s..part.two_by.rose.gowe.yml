- |
  

- "Q: So what would an average shift be like?"
- "Rose Gowen: Well, there were two kinds of shifts: slow shifts and busy shifts."
- |
  

- The slow shifts were really boring.
- |
  

- There wasn't much to do, but you'd try to look busy because otherwise the manager would make you face shelves &#151; that's when you make sure all the products are neat and pulled to the front of the shelves.
- |
  

- So, if it was slow, you'd swab down your counters and the rubber belt with Windex, and make up bags.
- "Q: How do you make up bags?"
- "Gowen: Oh, you just put paper bags inside plastic bags."
- |
  

- We'd make stacks of paper bags inside plastic bags at the end of our counters, so we'd be all ready to go.
- |
  

- Do you remember when you were little, they used to ask, "Paper or plastic?
- "\" Now it's both."
- |
  

- Or maybe it's a city/suburbs thing &#151; in the city everyone is walking and the paper/plastic combo is stronger and easier to carry, whereas in the suburbs you can pack your groceries in your car.
- |
  

- The other thing &#151; I don't know if this is a city thing, or an east coast thing, or what &#151; the customers bag their own groceries as a matter of course.
- |
  

- Well, not all of them, but a lot of them.
- |
  

- I was surprised about that, because I was always used to the store employees doing it; I always used to think that they were professionals, and they knew what they were doing, and for me, as a customer, to try to do it was just amateurish and annoying.
- |
  

- But in Philly, most of the customers bagged their own groceries.
- |
  

- I mean, I'd help them, but often they wanted it done in a certain way &#151; like they wanted two bags of equal weight so they'd be easier to carry.
- |
  

- And then there was the obsessive/compulsive guy.
- "Q: Yes?"
- "Gowen: One night, at the end of my shift, this guy came into my line, and the first thing he asked me was for a paper towel to wipe off his umbrella with &#151; it was raining."
- |
  

- So I gave him a paper towel, and rang up his groceries.
- |
  

- Most of which were, in fact, paper towels.
- |
  

- He had six rolls.
- |
  

- "And the rest of his groceries, I don't remember exactly what they were, but they were all clean, regular items: boxes and cans."
- |
  

- No produce, nothing lumpy or irregularly shaped.
- |
  

- And of each product, he bought multiples, in an even number.
- |
  

- I started to help him put everything in bags, but he wanted it done in a very specific way, and he was trying to explain it to me, and he was getting upset, so I just let him do it.
- |
  

- He divided his items in two, with the same number of each thing in each bag; he put them in two paper bags, and then he took two more paper bags and pulled them down over the top of the full bags.
- |
  

- Then he asked for four plastic bags.
- |
  

- He turned them inside-out because, he told me, he was afraid the ink on them would run in the rain.
- |
  

- He put each paper-encased column of groceries in an inside-out plastic bag, and pulled another plastic bag over the top.
- "Q: I always thought the paper towel thing was a joke."
- "Gowen: I know, me too!"
- "Q: Did you have any other memorable customers?"
- "Gowen: There was the faker."
- |
  

- The faker was this girl, I'd say she was between eighteen and twenty.
- |
  

- She came into my line one day with a whole cartful of groceries.
- |
  

- I thought there was something odd about her right from the start.
- |
  

- She looked like she was acting.
- |
  

- "She was dressed in this elegant, rich lady way &#151; sort of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" &#151; except the clothes were clearly second-hand. They looked like they were from a thrift store: worn, and they didn't fit her quite right. So I rang up her groceries, and it was a lot. It came to about two hundred dollars, I think. Now, the store had recently started delivering. If the customer lived within a certain distance of the store, someone &#151; a stocker, or one of the deli guys, or our security guard &#151; would take the groceries in a cart to their home. So this girl, this faker, said she was living in a fancy hotel nearby, and she wanted a delivery later, when her husband returned, and he would pay upon receipt. Well, okay. But then, a little while later, she called up and said she didn't want the groceries after all. And we had to put them away."
- "Q: How do you know she was a fake?"
- "Gowen: Oh, I don't for sure."
- |
  

- I just didn't believe she lived in the fancy hotel, and I didn't believe she was married.
- |
  

- The way she said, "My husband," sounded like she was playing a game &#151; she put too much emphasis on it. Everything about her seemed like she was trying to be a rich lady in an old movie, like Katherine Hepburn in "The Philadelphia Story" maybe.
- "Q: Maybe she was real."
- "Gowen: Yeah, maybe, but then why would she cancel the order?"
- |
  

- But you can never tell.
- |
  

- I mean, there was one time when the old owner's son accused the wrong person of shoplifting, and I would've made the same mistake.
- "Q: What happened?"
- "Gowen: There was a fuss at the front of the store, by the door."
- |
  

- This scruffy-looking middle-aged black guy was yelling.
- |
  

- "\"I'm never coming in here again, and I'm going to tell everyone not to give you their business!"
- |
  

- Racist assholes!
- |
  

- Fuck you!
- "\" he said, and stormed out."
- |
  

- And then a few seconds later, the old owner's son came to my line, and said to the guy I was ringing up, "
- Would you empty out your pockets, sir?
- "\" This guy was also middle-aged, but white, nicely coiffed, and wearing Brooks Brothers-style clothes."
- |
  

- He smirked, and took a small Vidalia onion out of his pocket.
- |
  

- I rang it up; I think it was thirty-nine cents.
- |
  

- He gave no appearance of being ashamed or embarrassed.
- |
  

- He really seemed amused by the whole thing.
- |
  

- He paid for his groceries and left.
- |
  

- Apparently, what happened was a woman had approached the old owner's son and told him she saw a man put something in his pocket, and the man was at the registers now.
- |
  

- So the old owner's son went to the registers and saw a shabby black man, and a polished white man, and picked the wrong guy.
- |
  

- I felt terrible about the incident, for the sake of the black guy, and I think the old owner's son was really embarrassed, but also, it was just terrible for me to realize that given the information the old owner's son had, I would've made the same mistake.
- "Q: That is pretty awful."
- "Gowen: I know."
- |
  

- I'm so ashamed.
- |
  

- Now I don't even want to talk anymore.
- "Q: Can I ask you one more question?"
- "Gowen: Okay, I guess."
- "Q: If you had the opportunity to work at a grocery store again, would you do it?"
- "Gowen: No, I've done that."
