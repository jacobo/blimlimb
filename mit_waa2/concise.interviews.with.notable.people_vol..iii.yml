- The piece would not be complete without a quote from Paul Theroux, a popular writer of travel books, so Wilson procured Mr. Theroux's semi-secret Cape Cod phone number from Theroux's publicist, and called him.

- I'm the writer from Hemispheres.

- Your publicist gave me this number.

- I'm calling to talk to you about an article on the popularity of travel writing.
- "Paul Theroux: Travel writing!"

- I was calling to talk to you  about travel writing.

- Wasn't it you people who called my publicist a few  weeks ago to inquire about my writing an essay on travel writing?
- "JW (with no knowledge of fact that his editor had perhaps tried to previously assign this story to Mr. Theroux): Uh."
- |
  

- I don't think I know anything about that, Mr. Theroux.
- "PT: Yes, your editor called my publicist a while ago and asked if I  would write an essay on travel writing."

- When there's one of these stories on travel  writing, I generally like to be the one who writes it, because I believe I can do a better job than anyone else.

- Okay.

- Well, can we still talk?

  (Please: All Concise Interviews with Notable People are real and
  unembellished, and should not be considered satirical or fabricated. To
  think so would be wrong.)
  In 1997, Jason Wilson, journalist of New Jersey, was asked by
  Hemispheres, the inflight magazine of United Airlines, to write a piece
  about the popularity of travel writing. The piece would not be complete
  without a quote from Paul Theroux, a popular writer of travel books, so
  Wilson procured Mr. Theroux's semi-secret Cape Cod phone number from
  Theroux's publicist, and called him.
  Jason Wilson: Hi, Mr. Theroux. I'm the writer from Hemispheres. Your
  publicist gave me this number. I'm calling to talk to you about an
  article on the popularity of travel writing.
  Paul Theroux: Travel writing! My publicist told me you were calling to
  talk about my new novel,  Kowloon Tong .
  JW: No, I'm the writer from Hemispheres. I was calling to talk to you 
  about travel writing.
  PT: Hemispheres? Wasn't it you people who called my publicist a few 
  weeks ago to inquire about my writing an essay on travel writing?
  JW (with no knowledge of fact that his editor had perhaps tried to
  previously assign this story to Mr. Theroux): Uh. I don't think I know
  anything about that, Mr. Theroux.
  PT: Yes, your editor called my publicist a while ago and asked if I 
  would write an essay on travel writing. I thought about it, but I told 
  her no, I just couldn't. Not at the rate they offered.
  JW (beginning to get miffed with both his Hemispheres editor and Mr.
  Theroux): Uh.
  PT: Quite frankly, I'm not too thrilled about this. This is, after all,
  how I make my living. When there's one of these stories on travel 
  writing, I generally like to be the one who writes it, because I believe
  I can do a better job than anyone else.
  JW: Oh. Okay. Well, can we still talk?
  PT: Oh, okay. Since she's already given you the number, we can talk 
  briefly.
  JW: I'd read somewhere that it annoyed you that most people only thought
  of you as a travel writer, and not as a novelist. Why is that?
