- "HANSON: \"Penny and Me\""
- We open to find Zac, Isaac, and Taylor rocking out in a small auditorium packed with kids.
- |
  

- Hanson is framed against a wall of vintage speakers that boom and bellow with sound.
- |
  

- But when we cut to a reverse-angle shot of the crowd, something is totally amiss.
- |
  

- The kids are sitting stone-faced and silent.
- |
  

- Confused, Hanson picks it up a notch.
- |
  

- Taylor's voice is now teeming with raw energy.
- |
  

- He grips the microphone so hard it looks like it could melt.
- |
  

- Isaac's fingers crawl over his frets like a centipede.
- |
  

- And Zac beats the living crap out of his drum kit.
- |
  

- They are surging with more energy than ever before, but the kids still don't react.
- |
  

- Hanson looks baffled but continues tearing through the track with a vengeance.
- |
  

- In our final shot, we are inside the tour van as they drive away, dumbfounded.
- |
  

- Through the back window we see the sign "SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF" as we cut to black.
- "JESSICA SIMPSON: \"Take My Breath Away\""
- This video will clearly be a parody of the  Newlyweds  series.
- |
  

- Our guerrilla cameras will follow the emotional story of Jessica as she flirts with disaster and falls for another guy (let's just call him S. Keneally).
- |
  

- Intimate shots of Jessica singing will be nothing compared to the intimate shots of Jessica and S. Keneally in the back of Nick's truck.
- |
  

- Of course, all conceptual imagery will be exclusively suggested so as to push the limits of MTV acceptability without crossing the line.
- |
  

- The video will be packed with tension as Nick nearly catches them in the act in several different locations.
- |
  

- As the song hits the climax, Nick storms into the bedroom and pries Jessica's supple, sweaty body off of S. Keneally.
- |
  

- We cut to S. Keneally hooked up to a ventilator in the ICU and mouthing the lyrics "Take my breath away.
- "\" Fade to black."
- "SCOTT STAPP: \"Relearn Love\""
- We find Scott Stapp performing in Magic Mountain before an audience of young kids and their parents.
- |
  

- The swirl of roller coasters creates a graphic backdrop for his inspired performance.
- |
  

- Throughout the song, we capture reaction shots of the adults and are surprised to find that they look horrified by what they are hearing.
- |
  

- One by one, the panicked parents cup their kids' ears and shuffle them out of the venue.
- |
  

- It's as if Scott were singing songs about Satan or something.
- |
  

- He has no idea why this is happening, but being a good sport, he continues performing.
- |
  

- As the song comes to a close, the entire audience has cleared out except for one small child in the front row.
- |
  

- Although the backing band looks crushed that everyone else vanished, Scott looks on the bright side.
- |
  

- He's happy he made a real connection with one fan.
- |
  

- But in our final shot, the small child stands up, flips Scott Stapp the bird, and walks off.
- |
  

- Fade to black.
