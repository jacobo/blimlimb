- Watch out for his hands -- they will gravitate toward your mouth.

  There are a few things you should know about The Devil when he enters
  your home.
  First:  He wears no shoes and his socks are often filthy and/or torn.
  Second:  He likes your mouth, and frequently will try to put his hand
  inside it.
  Third:  He is an emotional wreck.  Do not let him touch the wine and
  do not probe too deeply with your questions.
  Now make dinner.
  He likes fried foods.  Shrimp is his favorite.  He'll eat your
  left-over tails too.  He says they feel like helicopter blades in his
  throat.  For a beverage, have plenty of Dr. Pepper on hand.  He loves
  that
  stuff; and not just because he owns the soul of the man who invented it.
  He will talk a lot while eating and he says the word "soul" too often
  for your comfort.  You may ask him bluntly what he does with these souls
  
  when he has them signed over to his name.
  "I arrange them in my living room and watch TV with them," he
  explains.  "I have conversations and arguments with them.  They are just
  
  like the friends you have that visit you.  But when I get bored I can
  stretch them out and bounce on them like trampolines."
  You may notice that The Devil likes to play with ice cubes in his
  mouth before spitting them across the room.  He also bites his nails
  while
  releasing tiny, poisonous farts.  Humor him when he does these things by
  
  giggling timidly and remember to constantly remind him that he is pure
  evil.
  If you are going to a movie, keep in mind that he does not like
  Mickey Rourke or Richard Gere. He will pay for your ticket and he will
  buy
  popcorn with extra butter and salt. He will offer his arm as you walk
  down
  the aisle. He will want to sit close to a fire exit because it makes him
  
  feel at home. When the lights go low, he will put his long arm around
  your
  shoulder and pull you close to him. You will feel his hot breath
  exhaling
  from his flaring nostrils. When you are relaxed he will stick his hand
  inside your mouth.
  When the evening is coming to a close you must be firm yet friendly.
  He may wish to "come inside" for a nightcap or hot espresso drink.  He
  is
  not above pleading, and is known to complain during these moments about
  his
  feet.  Avert your eyes from the dirty socks.  Maybe offer to buy him
  shoes
  on your "next date".  Don't say sandals.  He will explode in anger if
  you
  say sandals.  He will wake up the neighborhood if you even slightly
  suggest
  that he wear sandals. When The Devil thinks of sandals he thinks of
  machine guns. Do not say sandals at any time during the evening and
  avoid
  wearing them yourself.

  It is very important to maintain control of these last moments of your
  date.  It is fun to date The Prince of Darkness, or at least not boring,
  
  but if you let him manipulate you on your first date he will never
  develop
  deep, caring feelings for you and will dump you like a month-old
  angelfood
  cake.
  Purse your lips tightly closed and kiss him lightly on his lips.
  Watch out for his hands -- they will gravitate toward your mouth.
