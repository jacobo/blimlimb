  The common (though unusual) grammatical structure of these headlines may
  strike readers as a grand coincidental error on the part of four
  independent newspapers. Or it may be construed as the joint effort of
  far-flung editors, motives unknown, to influence the acceptance of the
  awkward phrase "got game" into the American lexicon. Only the sharpest
  will garner that there may be a cultural reference hidden in the
  phraseology.
  Those who propose a connection to the ubiquitous "Got Milk?"
  advertisements wouldn't be altogether  wrong   -- in both cases "got"
  replaces the correct "have" or "has" -- nor would they be quite on
  target. In fact, the editors are alluding to a little-known film,  He
  Got Game , created by the director Spike Lee.
  At the crux of  He Got Game  is a high school basketball star being
  recruited by many colleges, and struggling with his decision. The
  headlines were written for stories about an eleventh hour agreement
  between the National Basketball Association's team owners and players,
  which forestalled the cancellation of the 1999 season. The game
  basketball -- and the potential of not having games or not playing the
  game -- is the shared link here.
  An added element of interest is the social dynamic inherent in this
  life/art connect. While most newspaper editors are white -- descended
  from Europeans, characterized by reduced pigmentation -- for the most
  part the most successful basketball players are black -- with at least
  one ancestor African, skin tone a varying shade of brown. In the United
  States, black and white people speak American English but many blacks
  additionally have a unique vernacular -- not unlike Southerners -- which
  they are either raised to speak or employ to demonstrate they haven't
  forgotten "where they come from," i.e., that they have at least one
  African ancestor.
  "He got game," an example of a construction originated by blacks, means
  "He plays good basketball." The question "He got game?" poses an
  assessment of ability -- "Does he possess this skill, inherently? Is he
  in control of his game -- and  the  game?" Of course "Is he worthy of
  the phrase?" is implied. In rap musician Sir Mix-A-Lot's 1998 hit "Baby
  Got Back," however, "got" is literal: "She has a healthy sized butt
  ['back' in black slang]" not "She has a command of her butt."
  So in the case of "We Got Game" or the Daily News' creative take on it,
  "We've Got Game," editors are indicating that, because professional
  basketball will resume, that "we", meaning the fans, the world at large,
  once again possess an active pastime, i.e., "got game."
  The newspaper editors in question are aware of the limitations of their
  white-bred (or, more commonly, "white-bread") language -- and of the
  heightened meaning that use of black vernacular can bring to an
  otherwise bland headline. (Note: Black readers more than likely
  understood the headline's significance from the get-go.) "Got Game" is
  not just a pithy way to note this event; it's not just drawing on the
  familiar wording of a movie, which starred John Turturro, in an amusing cameo. It's a symbol
  of a unified social struggle, of racial understanding, so subtle that
  it's possibly lost on the average (white) reader.   1
  There are those, of course, who would point to the "who's in/who's out"
  aspect of black/white relations. This line of thinking would reason that
  white editors, paranoid about not seeming adequate in the face of black
  culture -- historically blacks' taste in clothing style and music is
