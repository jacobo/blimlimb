  TITLE: Hail to President Tom
  WHEN: Without fail, I have gotten this daydream while watching
  "20/20" or "60 Minutes" any time in the last 13 years.
  SYNOPSIS: With epic scope, this forty-three second fantasy follows
  me
      through several grueling political campaigns and concludes with my
  years
      as a widely admired and distinguished elder statesman. Retirement
  suits
      me, I have to say, and my accomplishments while in office were great
  and
      lasting, such as nationalizing industry and education, eliminating
      poverty, and formulating a powerful foreign policy, all with my
  winning,
      if disturbingly flip, personal style. Plus I enjoy JFK-like
  adoration by
      female citizens.
  EVALUATION: A common premise for the politically aware
      delusions-of-grandeur set but somewhat redeemed by my no-apologies
  leftist
      ways and wickedly snide comments at debates (America laughed as I
      destroyed a few dedicated fascists with just a few well-placed
      bon mots). All in all, however, a bit pompous. Do I really expect
  myself
      to believe a president with holes in the elbows of his jackets? Do
  women
      have to like me in all my daydreams? Grow up, Tom!

  TITLE: Tom Under Fire
  WHEN: At home, watching the television, I get up to go to the
  bathroom or
      kitchen.
  SYNOPSIS: I'm back in World War I and right in the thick of all that
  
      fighting that was so popular then. I run through an elaborate trench
  
      system in Flanders. I think it's Flanders. Looks like Flanders.
      Could be Picardy. Ends with me getting shot in the face just when my
  side
      is on the cusp of victory.
  EVALUATION: The mournful tone that springs from its subterranean
  milieu is
      punctuated and brought to a transcendent conclusion by the
  narrator's
      death, which hovers between suicide and heroism, in what is at best
  an
      ethical gray area. Still, a touching and exciting romp. A boy's
  adventure
      fantasy by way of Sartre, with a touch of martyrdom for spice and
  tears.

  TITLE: Welcome Back, Tom
  WHEN: On the bus. Payday.
  SYNOPSIS: At some point I go to graduate school and return to my
  high
      school to teach history. In the classroom I deliver enchanting
  lectures,
      each predicated on the importance of memorizing names and dates.
  They eat
      it up, the students. Later, in my capacity as the most popular
  dormitory
      master ever, I lounge around turning the kids onto "free-thinking."
  The
      boys are enchanted by my beautiful wife, and the girls are more than
  
      mildly intrigued with my jet-setting lifestyle and effortless
      self-confidence. Soul-searching third act has me wondering whether
  to send
      my son to this school. Will it be too awkward for him to be under
  his father's
      considerable shadow?
  EVALUATION: A pastoral piece with enough "Good-bye, Mr. Chips"
      to carry it along for a while. But several important questions are
  left
      unanswered: Will institutional life make me conservative? And what
  happens
      when my wife and I get old and less attractive to the kids? Will my
      charisma diminish? Will they even want me as a dormitory master?
      Satisfying on the surface, but does not hold up under scrutiny.
  Isn't it
      just a death-in-life meets perpetual adolescence scenario? Also
  bears
      uncomfortable similarities to the "distinguished former statesman"
      sequence of the above presidential fantasy.
