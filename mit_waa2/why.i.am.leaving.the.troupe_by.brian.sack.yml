- Dear Tim,
- When I first came on board Hilarity Ensues, I was thrilled.
- |
  

- I thought being in Oswego's only improvisational comedy troupe was the beginning of what I intend to be a long and successful acting career.
- |
  

- I also thought the fact that Jesus was in the troupe was a bonus.
- It's been well over a year now, and I'm sure you realize things have not been so good.
- |
  

- The enthusiasm that I originally came with has waned considerably, almost completely, and the troupe's morale in general is at an all-time low.
- |
  

- I feel I should elaborate on why.
- From the very beginning it was obvious to me that Jesus was not a team player.
- |
  

- In my very first performance, Mike and I were doing a scene where a watermelon farmer is returning an eggbeater to a department store.
- |
  

- We had the audience in stitches.
- |
  

- We owned them.
- |
  

- Then Jesus walks offstage to an older woman and heals her ear.
- |
  

- We totally lost the crowd after that.
- That was my first inkling that Jesus was the kind of improviser that had His own agenda, other players be damned.
- |
  

- Usually, with a player like that, you hope that the director reins Him in during the after-show notes.
- |
  

- You never did.
- |
  

- In fact, that very same night, I recall you defending Him as "the King of Kings," even though I have more experience, having completed Level 3 classes at Upright Citizens Brigade in New York.
- And so we plodded on.
- |
  

- Every show was more of the spotlight-stealing same.
- |
  

- If Jesus wasn't inviting the whole audience to the Kingdom of Heaven, He was blessing them, guiding them, or turning pitchers of water into wine&#8212;which annoyed the waitresses no end.
- He was even nice to hecklers, which I think encouraged them even more.
- Most of us in the group hoped in vain that you would see the light and ask Jesus to tone it down.
- |
  

- Every single time, we were rebuffed.
- |
  

- It was "Son of God" this or "Messiah" that.
- |
  

- In your eyes, He could do no wrong.
- |
  

- I know He fixed your uncle's knee, but separation of personal and professional feelings is paramount here.
- |
  

- Hilarity Ensues was supposed to be about the comedy, yet we were dealt one blow after another.
- |
  

- Even though He killed nearly every scene, He was "the Savior" in your eyes.
- |
  

- And to add insult to injury, you gave Jesus a bio that took up most of the playbill.
- |
  

- I was limited to a headshot and a line mentioning my history degree.
- I know you consider a packed house to be the hallmark of success, but the people weren't there for Hilarity Ensues, or for improv comedy at all.
- |
  

- They were there for Jesus.
- |
  

- Perhaps from a business standpoint it was great&#8212;a full house at $10 a pop was not a shabby deal at all&#8212;but from a performer's standpoint it was a disaster.
- Did they ever appreciate my adherence to the Tao of Del Close?
- |
  

- No. Were they impressed with my lightning wit?
- |
  

- No. My repertoire of differently wigged characters?
- |
  

- No. They were there to be healed or saved or to personally request that their favorite team win the Super Bowl.
- |
  

- I'll never forget doing my awesome Greek fisherman character with the funny hat and not getting a single laugh because He couldn't stop ascending in the background.
- Improv is a team effort, Tim.
- |
  

- When you get a group of talented folks together and put them on stage, you have an amazing, magical experience.
- |
  

- But if one of those people is Jesus, I'm sorry to say, all bets are off.
- |
  

- Frankly, I think Jesus was the Yoko Ono of Hilarity Ensues, and you were the Lennon.
- At this point, I think it's best that I part ways.
- |
  

- I'm certain Oswego is big enough to support two improvisational-comedy troupes, so I'm starting up New and Improv-ed.
- |
  

- There are no hard feelings.
- |
  

- I hope you'll come see us.
- Sincerely,
- Luke
