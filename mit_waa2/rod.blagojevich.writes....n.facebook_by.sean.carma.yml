- I'm the governor of Illinois.
- |
  

- Well, I mean, I was, until recently.
- |
  

- I'm innocent.
- |
  

- That's the first thing you need to know.
- |
  

- The indictment is a lie.
- |
  

- When the truth comes out, I will be vindicated.
- |
  

- When I look in the mirror, I'm perfectly willing to admit, when I'm being honest with myself, that I am extremely good-looking.
- |
  

- I understand power.
- |
  

- No one is going to give you power.
- |
  

- Power is something you take.
- |
  

- Most people don't get this.
- |
  

- The hair.
- |
  

- If I had to name my most attractive quality, I would say it's the hair.
- |
  

- The hair has never let me down and I know it never will.
- |
  

- The thing about the hair is that it always looks good, even in a strong wind.
- |
  

- You can't teach that.
- |
  

- It's like Obama's halting cadence or Bill Clinton's thumb gesture.
- |
  

- You either have it or you don't.
- |
  

- OK, here's what happened during those phone conversations.
- |
  

- See, I was joking.
- |
  

- We kid around a lot in Chicago.
- |
  

- That's the kind of place it is.
- |
  

- We're not like those uptight people on the East Coast.
- |
  

- We know how to take a joke, see?
- |
  

- That's how it was.
- |
  

- Before the indictment, I was intensively focused on positioning myself to run for the United States Senate after the conclusion of my term as governor.
- |
  

- That's what's so ironic about all of this.
- |
  

- That Senate seat belonged to me.
- |
  

- It was mine.
- |
  

- And now Patrick Fitzgerald has taken it away from me.
- |
  

- That man has ambitions.
- |
  

- Don't be fooled by his charming, boyish image.
- |
  

- He wants things.
- |
  

- I should know.
- |
  

- My therapist says I'm an obsessive narcissist.
- |
  

- You know what?
- |
  

- My therapist can .
- |
  

- Never mind what my therapist can do.
- |
  

- My anger-management counselor says I need to change.
- |
  

- She says to think of a calm place and then go to that calm place.
- |
  

- Like, it could be a beach, she says, or a meadow filled with wildflowers, near the peak of a mountain.
- |
  

- And when I'm there I'm allowed to think of anything I want.
- |
  

- Anything.
- |
  

- That's freedom, right there.
- |
  

- That's what I like about the quiet place I can go to.
- |
  

- The freedom I have there.
- |
  

- Look, I'm only seeing her because my defense attorney insisted.
- |
  

- Still, I find I enjoy our sessions.
- |
  

- I had never experimented with transcendental meditation before.
- |
  

- I had never really had what you might call an epiphany.
- |
  

- It's something, when they come.
- |
  

- I'm like a cat.
- |
  

- A powerful, hungry cat.
- |
  

- But I'm also a great man.
- |
  

- A man who helps people.
- |
  

- A man who helps people who is also a strong cat in the wild, taking what he wants.
- |
  

- I could be in movies, I think.
- |
  

- Or on television.
- |
  

- You know what?
- |
  

- When this is over, I'm going to write a book.
- |
  

- I can do anything.
- |
  

- When it comes to Rod Blagojevich and his hair, the sky's the limit.
- |
  

- "Listen: write that down."
- |
  

- It's the last thing you need to know.
