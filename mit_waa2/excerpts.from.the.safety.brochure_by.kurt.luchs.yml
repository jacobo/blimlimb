  Good morning, and welcome to United Airlines Space Shuttle flight number 909 
  to Kuala Lumpur and continuing on to the Moon base at Copernicus Crater City. 
  Please remain in your seat throughout takeoff and after entering orbit. If 
  you must leave your seat, keep your magnetic boots on and walk slowly and 
  carefully. Do not remove your boots and try to float down the aisle carrying 
  your boots. Do not wait until the head of one of your fellow passengers or a 
  crew member is between your boots and a metal wall and then let the boots go, 
  pretending not to know what will happen.
  Under no circumstances should you cover your mouth with one hand, make false 
  radio static noises and say, "Houston, we have a problem." Nor should you 
  fashion a realistic alien pseudopod out of phosphorescent Silly Putty and 
  surreptitiously place it on the shoulder of the passenger in front of you. 
  Nor should you make strange gurgling sounds, clutch your heart and yell 
  hysterically, "The little bugger's biting through my chest cavity!"
  When being served your in-flight meal, please refrain from asking the flight 
  attendant what went wrong with the food replicators. Do not refer to any crew 
  member as "Seven of Nine" or "Two of 36D," and do not mention, even 
  obliquely, your own "very personal Borg implant." Keep the lid on your drink 
  at all times. Do not attempt to "liberate" your drink from the "unnatural 
  restraints of a weak, contemptible gravitational field." If your drink should 
  accidentally escape from its sealed reverse-pressure container, do not slap 
  the ball of liquid and disperse it into a thousand tiny globules.
  If you are seated near an emergency exit, do not ask the flight attendant for 
  an electric screwdriver under the pretext that you are "just one lug nut away 
  from Nirvana." Do not place a holographic decal of a Hubble telescope photo 
  of a supernova on the window and ask your fellow passengers what that strange 
  light is out there. It would also be a mistake at this point to cut a 
  Ping-Pong ball in half, draw scraggly lines on the pieces with a red felt-tip 
  pen, insert a piece into each eye socket and moan, "Oh my God, not that solar 
  flare thing again!"
  When the order is given to turn off all cellular phones, laptop computers and 
  portable DVD players prior to takeoff, it would be considered a serious 
  breach of security to keep pounding the mouseball and screaming, "More 
  thrust, damn it, we need more thrust or we'll never achieve escape velocity!"
  Passengers are strictly forbidden to pull down the oxygen masks directly 
  above their seats unless first instructed by a nonimaginary crew member. 
  Further, they are not to breathe into the mask, cough as if suffocating, and 
  declare, "My people need at least a 40 percent chlorine mixture to maintain 
  normal body metabolism." Simulated body spasms and cries for anyone present 
  to erect a level 10 force field and fill it with your world's atmosphere 
  could be disruptive to other travelers.
  If you need to use the restroom, it would be best to withhold any loudly 
  uttered comments from within the cubicle along the lines of, "My arm! It's

  inside wall and issue a warning about the wormhole reopening and the need 
  to reverse impulse engines.
  During our final approach and landing, please avoid assuming a head-down 
  crash position atop the nearest flight attendant and imitating an air-raid 
  siren or any type of emergency vehicle or injured seagoing mammal.
  If you are unable to read or understand these instructions, do not ask the 
  passenger next to you to read the instructions silently to themselves while 
  you attempt to perform a Vulcan mind-meld.
  Finally, we ask that while waiting to exit from the spacecraft, you refrain 
  from any high-decibel outbursts in which you plead frantically for someone
