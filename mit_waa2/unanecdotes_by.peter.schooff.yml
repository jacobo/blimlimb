- We met at dusk by the river because it was Fred's last night in town.
- |
  

- He was driving out West the next morning to start a new job, a new life.
- |
  

- The night sky was so clear you could see a million stars.
- |
  

- Everyone was there.
- |
  

- The booze was flowing, and someone was passing around a joint.
- |
  

- It was just like old times.
- |
  

- Gary said we should stay out until the sun came up.
- |
  

- We all agreed.
- |
  

- It got cold, so we gathered some wood and started a big bonfire.
- |
  

- At midnight, we decided to call it a night because most of us had to get up and work the next morning.
- |
  

- Tony loved Jules and wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.
- |
  

- Steve loved Jules and said he could not live without her.
- |
  

- Jules didn't know what she wanted.
- |
  

- When Tony and Steve told her she had to choose between them, she said she couldn't, that she loved them both, and ran off in tears.
- |
  

- So Tony and Steve decided they had to settle it themselves.
- |
  

- They found an abandoned house on the outskirts of town.
- |
  

- Tony brought a bottle of scotch and a bottle of bourbon; Steve brought two live hand grenades.
- |
  

- That's when my mother came into the room and told me stop watching so much daytime TV.
- |
  

- I knew something was not right with Bob that night.
- |
  

- Maybe it was the look in his eyes, or just a feeling in the air, but I could tell something bad was about to happen.
- |
  

- When the door to Tomahawk Joe's opened and Rudy walked into the bar, my suspicions were confirmed.
- |
  

- Rudy had ruined Bob's life.
- |
  

- He had stolen Bob's wife and humiliated him in front of the whole town.
- |
  

- Bob was looking for revenge, and everyone knew it.
- |
  

- As Rudy approached our table, I tensed up, ready for anything.
- |
  

- I watched as Bob slowly reached under the table and come up with something in his fist.
- |
  

- It was two Xanax, and he popped them into his mouth.
- |
  

- For the rest of the night, Bob just sat there in the corner with a stupid grin on his face.
- |
  

- Her words were all I had to get me through those long lonely nights.
- |
  

- She told me she had never met anyone like me before, and unless she did not know her own heart, our relationship had the makings of true love.
- |
  

- I told her I'd never been in love before, but asked her if she would show me the way.
- |
  

- I also wrote her that if my feelings got any stronger, my heart was going to burst.
- |
  

- So she set up a time and a place for the two of us to meet.
- |
  

- For two whole weeks, I could think of nothing else.
- |
  

- When the day finally came, I blew her off.
- |
  

- You can never tell with e-mail.
- |
  

- For all I knew, she could have been a guy.
- |
  

- Dirt grass leaves sky.
- |
  

- Dirt grass leaves sky.
- |
  

- They whipped past me in a blur as my brother pushed me on our swing outside our Kentucky farmhouse.
- |
  

- As I rose higher, I kept trying to push my chubby little legs straight up to heaven.
- |
  

- But then my foot snagged a branch.
- |
  

- I was too high.
- |
  

- I told my brother to stop, slow down, but he just laughed, and pushed harder.
- |
  

- I tried dragging my foot on the ground but only started the tire swing spinning.
- |
  

- I started crying.
- |
  

- My grip on the tire started loosening.
- |
  

- I screamed for him to stop.
- |
  

- With that, Dr. Dan, my psychiatrist, drew me out of my regressed state.
- |
  

- "\"Wow!"
- "\" I said, \""
- That's it.
- |
  

- I've had a breakthrough.
- |
  

- That must be where it all began.
- "\" \""
- Well," Dr. Dan said, "given that you've never been out of New York City, and you don't have a brother, I doubt it's your memory." I don't know.
- |
  

- Maybe I read it in a book.
