- First off, I don't talk to them.
- |
  

- OK?
- That's, like, the first thing.
- |
  

- Let's start there.
- It's not like I'm all, Hey, Peter Pufferfish, what's up?
- |
  

- Yo, nothing much, brah.
- It doesn't work like that, all right?
- |
  

- I mean, most of them don't even have brains, for one thing.
- |
  

- They have maybe a bump at one end of their spinal cord, a pimply little swelling of ganglia, if they're lucky.
- Language is not a looming issue, is what I'm saying.
- "No, how it works is: I command them."
- |
  

- Period, the end.
- |
  

- Command, as in bend them to, you know, my will and whatnot.
- |
  

- Fuckin' A.
- Even the ones with actual for-real brains, the cetaceans.
- |
  

- If I want, you know, a pod of Burmeister's porpoise to ram the hell out of Black Manta's Manta Sub, that shit gets done.
- |
  

- If I totally want, like, a southern minke whale to go hump a giant squid (its most hated enemy, by the way), I just go  doodoodoodoodoodoo  and it's like Show World down there.
- |
  

- "Not that I would, because, you know, gross, but I'm just saying: I don't ask."
- |
  

- I'm not going to be all, If you wouldn't mind terribly much, please, Mr. Southern Minke Whale, go get your nasty freak on with that giant squid.
- Just, you know, FYI.
- And it's not training.
- |
  

- "I read that on some blog: \"He just trains them to do all that."
- Dude, I can get 6 million krill to gunk up the engine of a getaway ship by having them hurl themselves up the intake jets.
- |
  

- Mass sea-monkey suicide.
- |
  

- OK?
- |
  

- Try that shit with operant conditioning, with some big-titted blondie waggling a smelt, see what you get.
- |
  

- Think they're meting out kick-ass sea justice over at Epcot?
- |
  

- Shyeah.
- But everyone takes their shot.
- |
  

- Fucking YouTube and shit.
- |
  

- Cartoon Network.
- |
  

- Suddenly every hacky comic's got a tight five-minute chunk on lame old Aquaman.
- |
  

- "\"Haw haw haw, he's so laaaaame, hee hee hee, go talk to a guppy!"
- It's all good.
- |
  

- Somehow I manage to suffer through it.
- |
  

- "I soldier bravely the fuck on, comforted only by the small but telling fact that I'm absolute goddamn ruler of\x97what was it again?"
- |
  

- EARTH.
- The PLANET.
- And you, you're, like, star of open-mike night at the Mirth Shack in Jacksonville.
- |
  

- And your MySpace blog?
- |
  

- OMG!
- |
  

- ROTFLMAO!
- You used to be cool, man.
- When you were a kid, you'd sit at the bottom of the Stupaks' pool, remember?
- |
  

- Used to sit there and pretend the kickboard between your knees was Storm the Giant Seahorse, and you'd stay under for as long as you could, going  doodoodoodoodoodoo .
- Remember there was that orange T-shirt you had?
- |
  

- Remember that?
- |
  

- That was cool.
- You sure seemed like a happy little kid.
- But, you know, I get it.
- |
  

- Whatever, that was a long time ago.
- |
  

- Now you're all, Wonder Woman never even let him fly her plaaaane, and whatnot.
- |
  

- And that's, you know, fine.
- I could command you.
- |
  

- You, those  Robot Chicken  assholes, alla y'all.
- |
  

- Command you all to, you know, quit it.
- I don't make, like, a big deal about that, but I could.
- |
  

- You're just a fish at heart, dude.
- |
  

- Down deep in your forebrain.
- |
  

- I fuckin' could.
- But I won't.
- |
  

- That's not how I roll.
- |
  

- I'm a hero.
- |
  

- Plus, I'm King of the Seven Seas, so, you know, I got shit to  do , right?
- No, it's fine.
- |
  

- You rock on with your bad self, dude.
- |
  

- Mazel tov.
- Seriously, though, leave my lady out of it.
- |
  

- That's not cool, man.
- |
  

- Mera, she doesn't get it like I do.
- |
  

- She's sensitive.
- |
  

- I start hearing you talking shit about her, or her hard-water powers, or that time she turned evil, and I will fuck your shit  up .
- |
  

- Count on it.
