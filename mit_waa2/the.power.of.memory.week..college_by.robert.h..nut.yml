- I was sitting on my front porch one day when a couple of the neighbor boys walked up the path.
- |
  

- Something was on their minds, and it didn't take them long to tell me about it.
- |
  

- Their teacher had told them to learn the thirteen original states of the Union as their history assignment for the day, and one look at that formidable list had them down.
- |
  

- Neither of them, they admitted candidly, was a star pupil as it was, and&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;well, they wanted to go fishing.
- |
  

- If they could only find a way of memorizing those states quickly.
- |
  

- They beat around the bush for a while and then one of them came to the point.
- "\"Do  you  know the thirteen original states?"
- "\" he asked."
- I had to admit I didn't, and his face fell.
- "\"Heck,\""
- |
  

- "\"Pop said you were a memory expert or something."
- "\"Well,\""
- |
  

- I said, "I don't know them now, but I'd like to learn them.
- |
  

- Suppose you run home and get your book, and we'll memorize them together.
- "\"Can you teach us by tomorrow?"
- "\" they wanted to know."
- "\"I'll teach you by this afternoon, and you'll have time to go fishing besides."
- They were back with the book in no time.
- |
  

- I began by explaining my first thirteen key words and the way they were used to hook up images and associations.
- |
  

- The boys mastered these easily, finding them vastly entertaining.
- |
  

- Then we went on to work up associations for each state.
- |
  

- The boys were bristling with interest as they discovered for the first time that memorizing can be fun instead of drudgery.
- |
  

- The next afternoon the boys returned, glowing.
- |
  

- Not only had both recited the states perfectly, but one of them, flushed with self-confidence, had volunteered to reel them off  backwards , and his performance had gone off without a hitch.
- You may be interested to know just what associations we used in memorizing the thirteen original states.
- |
  

- Perhaps you will want to try it yourself.
- |
