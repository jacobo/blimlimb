- |
  

- Two men sift through garbage in a bin near Highbury Fields.
- |
  

- They wear Islington Council reflective jackets and yellow gloves.
- |
  

- They use long metal utensils.
- |
  

- "Pete: So you come across lots of unopened bottles, don't you?"
- "Phil: Bottles."
- |
  

- Lots of cans.
- "Pete: You ever take them?"
- "Phil: Tins once in a while."
- "Pete: Serious?"
- "Phil: If they've still got the labels on."
- "Pete: Like a homeless guy would?"
- "Phil: They're sealed tins, you know."
- "Pete: But you only take the ones with labels, yeah?"
- "Phil: You could end up with mangoes if you don't."
- "Pete: Or some freak who puts his shit in a tin."
- "Phil: Never seen that."
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Pete: I wouldn't take a tin."
- |
  

- Couldn't pay me to take a tin.
- "Phil: I never once heard of someone who would take time to put his shit in a tin and then seal that tin and put that tin in the garbage and think that someone would take it home."
- "Pete: You never know."
- "Phil: You can be sure of some things."
- "Pete: I'll buy my tins in the store, I will."
- |
  

- They sift through the garbage.
- |
  

- Phil uncovers a bottle of Budweiser beer.
- |
  

- The cap is still on.
- |
  

- "Pete: Bud's not bad, yeah?"
- "Phil: When you got nothing else."
- "Pete: No, I used to drink it when I was with my brother in America."
- |
  

- Like water they drink it there.
- |
  

- Even have bottles with a wider opening at the top so you can slam beer.
- |
  

- My brother slams beer.
- "Phil: They treat it like a soft drink."
- "Pete: He slams it."
- |
  

- One swallow.
- "Phil: It's just Pepsi to them."
- "Pete: You can buy it in cases of ninety."
- "Phil: And tasteless too."
- |
  

- Gassy.
- "Pete: My brother could burp, you know, for five minutes after slamming."
- "Phil: You spend half your time burping"
- "Pete: Sometimes ten minutes he would go on for."
- |
  

- You want it?
- "Phil: No."
- "Pete: Label's on it."
- "Phil: I didn't say I take everything with a label, did I?"
- "Pete: All right."
- "Phil: There's discretion, yeah?"
- |
  

- They root around through the garbage.
- |
  

- "Pete: It's sort of disgusting."
- |
  

- This job?
- |
  

- If you think about it.
- "Phil: You get the odd diamond."
- "Pete: Tell me when you see one."
- |
  

- They root around.
- |
  

- "Phil: I play this game sometimes where I try to figure out where a piece of garbage comes from."
- |
  

- It's like everything has its own story.
- |
  

- Everything in here was once somewhere else.
- |
  

- When you think of it that way the whole job gets more interesting.
- "Pete: Gets interesting how?"
- "Phil: You should give it a try."
- |
  

- Pete picks up a newspaper with his utensil.
- |
  

- "Pete: What was this in the beginning?"
- |
  

- A newspaper?
- |
  

- What's it now?
- |
  

- A wet newspaper.
- |
  

- That's really fucking interesting.
- "Phil: You're not trying."
- |
  

- What about this?
- "Pete: Oh, that's even better."
- |
  

- I've never seen an empty bag of crisps before.
- |
  

- That's absolutely stunning.
- "Phil: But if you were playing the game, you'd be able to imagine that maybe this bag of crisps belonged to some kid who might become the, I don't know, the next Frank Sinatra."
- "Pete: The next what?"
- "Phil: Or whoever."
- |
  

- It's just an example.
- "Pete: But it didn't even belong to them."
- |
  

- They just used it for a few minutes, or however long it takes to eat a bag of crisps.
- |
  

- It's not like it was one of their  things .
- "Phil: Who truly knows what we remember later on?"
- "Pete: You remember every bag of crisps you've eaten then?"
- "Phil: No, but I'll be having a laugh at you in twenty years when some young singer is on Top of the Pops and he's talking about how his dad would take him to Highbury Fields."
- |
  

- "Pete: And buy him a bag of crisps?"
- "Phil: Sure."
- "Pete: And when have you seen a singer on Top of the Pops talk about what kind of shit food he used to eat when he was small and sitting in a park?"
- |
  

- You've been going through garbage too long, mate.
- "Phil: Don't be getting on me about going through garbage."
- |
  

- You find the odd diamond you do.
- |
  

- He retrieves a tissue spotted with blood.
- |
  

- "Phil: What do you think of this?"
- "Pete: Oh, come on, it's a bloody tissue."
- "Phil: But this would be a good item to use as an example."
- |
  

- What do you think its story is?
- "Pete: Someone had a nosebleed."
- |
  

- I'm not touching it.
- "Phil: But if we were playing the game."
- "Pete: We're not playing the game."
- "Phil: But if you gave the game a chance."
- "Pete: We're not playing the game."
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Phil: I'll tell you what I see."
- |
  

- I see a murderer coming over from Highbury Grove, bloodied from the final swings of his victim.
- "Pete: What are you?"
- |
  

- Jeffrey fucking Archer?
- |
  

- It's a tissue with some blood on it.
- |
  

- It's from some sad shit addict is all.
- "Phil: That's the idea."
- "Pete: The idea of what?"
- "Phil: Go on."
- |
  

- Is it a she?
- |
  

- Comes from a broken home?
- |
  

- Shoots up twice a day?
- "Pete: There's no story."
- |
  

- It's a thing.
- "Phil: Two kids, different fathers, can't support them both so she has to stand out by the Barclay's machine and whisper to the men passing by."
- "Pete: Yeah."
- |
  

- She says, "Watch out for the crazy tosser sifting through garbage in the bins.
- |
  

- He says he works for Islington Council but he's really a spaz.
- "Phil: I'd happily play a part."
- "Pete: Put the tissue back, Philip."
- "Phil: Don't point your utensil at me, Peter."
- "Pete: I really, on a day like this, don't need to be standing here acting out the life history of a bloody napkin."
- "Phil: You see how it passes the time though?"
- |
  

- You see that?
- "Pete: You know, doing work passes the time, too."
- "Phil: Doing work."
- |
  

- They eventually begin rooting around in the garbage again.
- |
  

- Phil lifts out a horse figurine.
- |
  

- It's missing one of its front legs.
- |
  

- "Phil: It was her first Christmas in the new house."
- "Pete: Oh, that's it."
- "Phil: And she loved ponies more than life itself."
- |
  

- Pete throws his utensil to the ground.
- |
  

- "Phil: I'm sorry."
- "Pete: There's a reason."
- |
  

- "Phil: That was uncalled for on my part."
- "Pete: There's a reason it's called garbage, yeah?"
- "Phil: But who throws out a toy like this?"
- "Pete: I don't care."
- "Phil: A miserable, jealous stepmother, that's who."
- |
  

- And she's blonde.
- |
  

- "Pete: Phil there's no stepmother, there's no fucking girl with a pony, there's no addicts at the Barclay's, and there's no Frank fucking Sinatra junior eating beef and onion crisps in the park."
- "Phil: And there's no God."
- "Pete: There's no what?"
- "Phil: You were going to tell me there's no God."
- "Pete: I was not."
- "Phil: It just seemed like you were on a roll is all."
- "Pete: Well, you know what?"
- |
  

- There is no God, yeah?
- |
  

- Not in this bin.
- "Phil: Maybe not but."
- |
  

- "Pete: You're not gonna find anything but bloody tissues."
- "Phil: Maybe not but."
- |
  

- "Pete: Now please don't say that shit again."
- "Phil: You do find the odd diamond."
- |
  

- He holds the pony figurine up with his utensil.
- |
  

- "Phil: It's only missing one leg now, isn't it?"
- |
  

- Pete?
