- Dear radioactive spider,
- I&#8217;m already twenty-seven years old, and I still don&#8217;t have the abilities of a spider.
- |
  

- I know you&#8217;re out there, and, for whatever reason, you&#8217;ve decided that biting a (relatively) young, socially awkward boy isn&#8217;t one of your priorities.
- You should totally bite me.
- |
  

- I could fight supervillains!
- |
  

- I know, there haven&#8217;t been very many supervillains in this part of the country.
- |
  

- The pickings here are slim, since most Pittsburghers are blue-collar yinzers too tired after work to cause trouble, or rugrat Pitt students just looking to get cheap beer and free sex, which I admit aren&#8217;t standard supervillain goals.
- But think of all the things I could do with the powers of a spider!
- |
  

- I could be swinging between buildings on long, ropy strands of webbing!
- |
  

- I could be climbing up sheer walls!
- |
  

- I could be punching bank robbers and rapists!
- |
  

- I could have pectoral muscles!
- |
  

- But no, I have to walk to where I want to go, and the only thing I can shoot out of my wrists is blood, and that&#8217;s not possible without probably dying afterward.
- Why me, you ask?
- |
  

- "Well, I&#8217;ve got the best superhero secret identity in the world: I&#8217;m a claims adjuster for a giant insurance company!"
- |
  

- How much more mild-mannered can you get?
- |
  

- Seriously, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m just begging to become a superhero, which I guess I sort of am.
- If begging isn&#8217;t going to work, how about a trade?
- |
  

- You bite me first and then I bite you?
- |
  

- Think of the powers you&#8217;ll get!
- |
  

- You&#8217;ll be able to type over ninety words a minute!
- |
  

- You&#8217;ll gain the ability to pretend to be working when your boss or a snitchy coworker walks by!
- |
  

- You&#8217;ll be able to change a flat tire, or at least hold the umbrella above your girlfriend&#8217;s head while she does it better than you probably could have yourself.
- I&#8217;m waiting, radioactive spider.
- |
  

- You might have cancer or something, because of the radioactiveness, so you should probably hop to.
- Sincerely,
- James Foreman
- Sewickley, PA
