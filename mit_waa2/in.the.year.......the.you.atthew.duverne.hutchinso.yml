- "ME: For some reason, I can't get this report orb to beam."
- "HOTSHOT: Well, go ahead and materialize the topaz orb first."
- |
  

- That should launch your facefield preferences.
- "ME: OK, here goes ."
- |
  

- Wait, remind me, how do I get to the topaz orb?
- |
  

- "Sorry, I knew how to do this just a second ago\x97I imagine a shape, right?"
- "HOTSHOT: Kind of."
- |
  

- Defocus your eyes and visualize a beam of light illuminating a rhombus.
- |
  

- That will materialize the topaz orb.
- "ME: Hmm ."
- |
  

- It's still not working.
- "HOTSHOT: OK, let's back up a step."
- |
  

- Which wormhole did you do your push-up in?
- "ME: I'm pretty sure it was Wormhole Gamma."
- |
  

- But I did a sit-up.
- |
  

- Does a sit-up not work?
- "HOTSHOT: Oh, you did a sit-up?"
- |
  

- Smirk.
- |
  

- Yeah.
- |
  

- That's  probably  why it's not working.
- |
  

- Try it again.
- |
  

- I lie down and do a push-up.
- |
  

- Immediately, a lifelike 3-D porno hologram materializes in my cubicle with the volume turned way up.
- |
  

- Co-workers begin to gather.
- |
  

- The hologram depicts me naked on the plank of a pirate spaceship with our company's robot intern, Suzanne.
- |
  

- The scenario is dirty in a way not yet fully describable in our present age.
- |
  

- "ME: Turn it off!"
- |
  

- "HOTSHOT: I can't."
- |
  

- You have to double-imagine the red orb to quit out of iPerv.
- |
  

- I try desperately to materialize the red orb, but instead accidentally launch a hologram chat with my late grandfather from beyond the grave.
- |
  

- "GRANDFATHER HOLOGRAM: Where am I? Who's moved my reading chair?"
- "ME: Granddad, I can explain."
- |
  

- Hold on a sec .
- |
  

- Swatting at my temples like a fevered gibbon, I accidentally materialize a mastodon diorama, Dabney Coleman, the color green, and John Coltrane's  Giant Steps  album.
