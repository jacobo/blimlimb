- A DISPATCH BY  ROBERT KEVIN WALTERS
- |
  

- HATTIESBURG, MISSISSIPPI&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;She had four gold teeth, black jeans, freckles, and a sweet voice.
- |
  

- Motherly, I thought, but I don't know if Rose had children or not.
- "\"I'm supposed to be at work,\""
- |
  

- "\"But they can wait."
- She perched, legs crossed at the knees, on the hood of her sea green Cadillac in the hard-packed dirt of the front yard of a house off Charles Street where we meet.
- |
  

- It's her boyfriend Romerio's house, she said, but hopefully not for too much longer.
- |
  

- She had plans.
- Nearby stood Romerio, who even when he stood up straight slouched, wearing a black T-shirt with a middle-finger salute silk-screened on it.
- |
  

- "He looked younger than me but coughed like my grandfather: as if his mouth were full of broken wood chips."
- |
  

- He stood near the Cadillac with two other guys, Carlton and Jerome, watching.
- |
  

- Romerio and Rose kept breaking up and then getting back together again, Romerio said, watching her for a response of some sort as he told me about their romance.
- Rose sat unmoving on the car, mulling him over.
- |
  

- Maybe you're a troublemaker, I told him.
- |
  

- He shrugged.
- |
  

- Maybe so.
- "Rose began her story: On Monday she and her mother Rosy found an envelope taped to the bottom of a dresser drawer in a retirement community in Columbia, Mississippi."
- |
  

- Rose opened it.
- "\"I looked at it and then I looked at it again."
- "\" She stared up into the pecan tree's limbs, remembering the moment."
- |
  

- "\"And then I looked again."
- Wouldn't that be the proper response of anyone who'd found a million dollars&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;no, a million-dollar bill?
- |
  

- One single bill worth a million.
- Rose took the bill in its envelope to a bank in Columbia that she said verified the money was real, even though there was only sixty percent of the bill left.
- |
  

- Moths or silverfish or rats had eaten the bill in its envelope&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;who knew how long it had been taped under that dresser drawer?
- |
  

- Who knew who put the bill down there?
- |
  

- One thing for sure, the United States Treasury didn't print them any longer.
- "\"They used to make them,\""
- |
  

- Carlton said.
- |
  

- "\"Don't you remember it from history class?"
- |
  

- Million-dollar bills.
- |
  

- Only printed a few.
- Rose drove back to Hattiesburg, light-headed, and took the bill to another bank.
- |
  

- "A teller told Rose she had two choices: to mail it to the Federal Reserve's offices in New Orleans or drive the two hours down U.S."
- |
  

- Collectors, Romerio said.
- |
  

- Collectors will pay top dollar for it.
- |
  

- "\"We can get more with a collector."
- |
  

- See, all you get with that bill is a million dollars.
- |
  

- But a collector, he'll pay more.
- There was more good news.
- |
  

- While the dresser belonged to Rosy, the store where it was purchased years and years ago was out of business now.
- |
  

- Romerio had covered all the bases.
- Rose listened to him patiently, like a mother with a child.
- |
  

- "\"A million is fine with me."
- "\"Hey, Mr. Newspaper Man,\""
- |
  

- Romerio said, addressing me.
- |
  

- "\"What would you do?"
- "\"Me, I'd be in New Orleans right now."
- |
  

- I'd be six inches high off the ground.
- "\"High?"
- "\" Romerio said, somber."
- |
  

- "\"Don't write high."
- |
  

- We're not high.
- |
  

- That looks bad to write high.
- "\"Can I see it?"
- "\" I said to Rose."
- "\"Sure,\""
- |
  

- Rose said.
- |
  

- She pulled back her collar and reached into her shirt&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;it's called the bosom bank my mom told me later&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and removed an envelope from her bra.
- |
  

- She cupped it in her hand momentarily and then lay it on the hood of the car so she could pull its flap away.
- |
  

- Careful, careful.
- |
  

- Piece by piece, she removed the one-million-dollar bill inside.
- "\"See,\""
- |
  

- Rose said.
- |
  

- "\"Cotton paper."
- |
  

- It's getting wet.
- |
  

- I've got to find someplace else to keep it.
- I photograph it.
- |
  

- First the front, with the Statue of Liberty, then the back.
- "\"It's got Mount Rushmore on the back,\""
- |
  

- Carlton said.
- |
  

- "\"Don't you remember that from the history books?"
- I want to touch it and, by equal measure, I don't want to even be near it.
- |
  

- It's the same response I have when young mothers want to hand me their children.
- |
  

- It's a task better left for the experts, for people other than me, that is.
- Rose slept in her bra with the envelope snugly in place, though she really didn't sleep much.
- |
  

- And she couldn't eat all day long.
- |
  

- Nerves.
- |
  

- And even though she was late for work, her head was someplace else.
- |
  

- She had a one-million-dollar bill.
- |
  

- She planned to tithe part of the money before she bought anything for herself.
- |
  

- First, she wanted to buy a house and a car for herself.
- |
  

- Then a house and a car for her mother, Rosy.
- |
  

- Then she'd donate some to the city Fire Department.
- "\"Write this up good,\""
- |
  

- Romerio said.
- |
  

- "\"We'll buy you and your girlfriend dinner."
- "\" I tell him I'm a widower."
- |
  

- "\"Well then, we'll go to a titty bar then."
- "\" She didn't even have the money yet, and Romerio was already spending it."
- Driving back to the newspaper, I was happy for Rose.
- |
  

- She seemed deserving of good luck.
- |
  

- Sweet.
- |
  

- A lifetime of Romerios sponging off her.
- |
  

- But I was thinking in a bigger way, too, how things work out unexpectedly good, a confluence of the right place and the right time and the right person.
- |
  

- Rose had me thinking that maybe the big twists in life aren't always just in disastrous instants of misfortune like car wrecks, floods, meteors falling from the sky.
- At the newspaper, I called the bank in Columbia to talk to a teller whom I think will be more than happy to tell me about Rose and how excited they are?
- |
  

- Instead, the teller forwarded me to the bank's president who won't talk about it.
- |
  

- He won't confirm if there's even been a million-dollar bill or not.
- |
  

- No comment.
- So then I called the bank in Hattiesburg where Rose said she took the bill, but no one's heard of Rose or the million-dollar bill there.
- |
  

- Come on, a million-dollar bill?
- |
  

- Didn't they read the history books?
- So I called Rose's number at home but it had been disconnected.
- |
  

- I called Carlton's cell phone to try to get a hold of Rose, so she could clear the whole thing up.
- |
  

- He said Rose had to go to work.
- |
  

- She worked at a nursing home in Hattiesburg as a nurse's assistant.
- |
  

- And no, he didn't know the number.
- |
  

- Carlton wanted to get rid of me, I could tell.
- |
  

- Could I speak to Rosy then?
- |
  

- I was told she didn't want to give interviews.
- |
  

- I was pesky, peppering him with too many questions, but I was buzzed, excited for Rose.
- |
  

- So I looked up the nursing home's phone number and called.
- May I speak to Rose?
- "\"Why?"
- |
  

- Who wants to know?
- I was with the newspaper, I explained.
- |
  

- I was on a deadline.
- "\"Well,\""
- |
  

- "\"if you're from the paper I'm sure it's nothing that can't wait 'til tomorrow."
- "Her voice, equal parts nasty and Southern belle graciousness, made me recall all the nurses I'd known in my life: the scowling half-wits and sadists dolling out shots and grimaces and lousy food."
- |
  

- I hated them, mostly.
- |
  

- Please God, let me die in the gutter without ever talking to another nurse again.
- Shaken, I called Carlton back.
- |
  

- No answer.
- |
  

- I called again.
- |
  

- Still nothing.
- I needed answers.
- |
  

- I needed truth.
- |
  

- I needed Rose.
- |
  

- Then I called the Treasury.
- |
  

- They could take care of this.
- |
  

- They could solve everything.
- |
  

- I was patched through to a public affairs officer in D.C.
- I needed to know about a million-dollar bill that a local woman found while cleaning out&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;
- "\"Let me stop you right there,\""
- |
  

- "\"The United States government has never printed a one-million-dollar bill."
- |
  

- We get these calls all the time.
- Never printed them and never will.
- |
  

- The largest denomination of bill the government has ever printed is a ten-thousand-dollar bill, sorry.
- |
  

- But I still had the photo I took that morning and the bill's treasury numbers - or what's left of them.
- I read them off to her.
- |
  

- She gave me a breathy laugh.
- "\"Someone dummied up a one-dollar bill,\""
- |
  

- Treasury woman said.
- |
  

- It was either a forgery or a gag bill that someone saved, either because they thought it was real or because someone hoped others would come along one day, years later, and "discover" it. Like finding a Picasso in a garage sale or a Renoir in the attic.
- I hung up.
- |
  

- The money was a joke.
- |
  

- A Maltese Falcon.
- |
  

- I couldn't call Rose.
- |
  

- I couldn't get Carlton.
- |
  

- I didn't know how to find Romerio and didn't know if I really wanted to.
- "For a time I sat at my desk thinking about what my afternoon held: I had to write a story about a building, its location, square footage, ground-breaking ceremonies."
- |
  

- The kind of story that always made the newspaper for sure, even though people just skimmed right over it.
- |
  

- It was about something real.
- Somewhere right then Rose was working in a musty hallway reeking of ammonia while she sweat on her fortune, scared of ruining her money but excited.
- |
  

- Plans ran through her head like a hundred electric trains.
- It was better if I didn't find Rose.
- |
  

- In the absence of a fortune, let her have dreams.
- |
