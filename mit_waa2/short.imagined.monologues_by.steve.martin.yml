- Greetings, Houston!
- |
  

- And the suburbs.
- |
  

- And those towns too far out to qualify as suburbs but close enough for residents to make the drive.
- |
  

- I'm gonna rip the Hyperlink apart, reassemble him, then rip him apart again!
- |
  

- But I won't reassemble him the second time .
- |
  

- Of course, I'm not really dismembering anyone.
- |
  

- But if you like bloodshed you picked a great night to be here!
- |
  

- "I know it's not, meteorologically speaking, a great night\x97 I mean, it's pouring out there ."
- |
  

- And the fact you drove here in such poor conditions with horrible visibility, well, it means a lot to me.
- |
  

- And so does killing the Hyperlink!
- |
  

- I won't actually take his life.
- |
  

- "But I'll beat him up real good\x97or bad."
- |
  

- Whichever makes more sense.
- |
  

- He backstabbed me.
- |
  

- Literally?
- |
  

- No. But he betrayed me.
- |
  

- And one thing Eco Joe doesn't like is when someone messes with his trust.
- |
  

- Eco Joe's been hurt too many times.
- |
  

- "Eco Joe placed his trust in a woman and she ran off with Eco Joe's financial adviser\x97and all of Eco Joe's savings."
- |
  

- Eco Joe's therapist insists that Eco Joe is making progress.
- |
  

- Yet sometimes Eco Joe can't find the strength to get out of bed and face the day.
- |
  

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy and a cocktail of Zoloft, Abilify, and Ativan don't seem to help.
- |
  

- But Eco Joe knows you don't want to hear his problems.
- |
  

- He also knows that talking in the third-person is annoying, and he'll stop now.
- |
  

- "To everyone watching on pay-per-view, I hope you're with friends\x97splitting the cost\x97so it's only a few bucks each."
- |
  

- It's still possible to enjoy entertainment in a down economy!
- |
  

- Get ready to see me pin this guy!
- |
  

- Technically, I could also win by count-out, disqualification, or forfeit.
- |
  

- Maybe he'll submit to my signature move, the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.
- |
  

- But pinning someone is more satisfying.
- |
  

- Especially pinning a trust-breaking bastard.
- |
  

- Wait.
- |
  

- The Hyperlink isn't really a  bastard .
- |
  

- "I had dinner at his parents' place last night\x97wonderful people."
- |
  

- His father is very much in the picture.
- |
  

- "In fact, he and the Hyperlink share a hobby: building ships in bottles."
- |
  

- Mr. and Mrs. Schwartzman, thanks for your hospitality.
- |
  

- Please e-mail me that chicken recipe.
- |
  

- Was that fennel I tasted?
- |
  

- Speaking of chicken, my opponent is shaking backstage.
- |
  

- "I take that back: the Hyperlink has early-onset Parkinson's and the shaking isn't his fault."
- |
  

- But he's probably hiding under a blanket.
- |
  

- "Then again, so was I\x97the locker rooms are freezing."
- |
  

- There's the Hyperlink's entrance music, the Mac startup sound.
- |
  

- The Hyperlink's about to become a dead link.
- |
  

- Like when you click and a page says "404 Not Found.
- "\" It was between that and a line about composting him\x97to keep with the eco theme."
- |
  

- The guys backstage liked the dead-link line.
- |
  

- OK, I've said all I had to say.
- |
  

- Was I too negative?
- |
  

- I hate when I get all negative.
- |
  

- Sorry if I brought anyone down.
- |
  

- I mean, this is WrestleMania!
- |
  

- It's on!
- |
