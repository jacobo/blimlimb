- Second, tape trading is one of the most effective modes of word-of-mouth  advertising that exists and tends to increase the enthusiasm factor among fans and creates a sense of community among those who tape and trade tapes.
- Third, it increases the take at the gate because of the widening of their fan-base, and because it attracts the interest of more tapers in the area, many will attend the concert if they know they'll be allowed to tape.
- Finally, taping encourages fans to trade their live recordings among themselves, so the most ardent ones--who would be a prime target for bootleggers to sell their wares to--will already have a copy of all the most sought-after shows.

- Therefore, the bootleggers will have fewer potential buyers to peddle their illegal wares to.
- Another point is that bootleggers tend to ignore laws and are not the kind of people who will wait until you allow taping before deciding to bootleg you.

  ME: Hey, is that your Explorer parked in my spot?
  HIPPIE: Yeah. I was unloading my taping equipment.
  ME: What were you taping?
  HIPPIE: I just got back from The Further Festival in Somerset. You know,
  Bob
  Weir--The Other Ones, Rat Dog. Mickey Hart's Planet Drum.
  ME: I've never heard of it.
  HIPPIE: The bands allow taping in an official taping section on the
  lawn.
  Taping is usually allowed if you don't affect anyone else's line of
  sight or
  bother others, but the tolerance factor often varies from venue to
  venue.
  For the Summer Tour you don't need tapers tickets, but you have to have
  a
  lawn ticket--the tapers section is limited to the lawn area--in order to
  
  get your taping equipment in the door.
  Some places have taping restrictions. It's easier to get your taping
  equipment in if you are in the first wave getting in the door. If you
  get
  there too late, you will most likely be told that the taping section is
  full
  and you'll have to take your taping gear back to your car.
  Last year we showed up early at one venue only to find out that security
  
  wasn't informed that it's OK to let tapers in. We insisted on talking to
  the
  head of security. He told us to get lost. Then we tried another entrance
  in
  the hopes of finding a cooler security guard. No luck. We had to stealth
  it.
  ME: What do you do with the tapes?
  HIPPIE: Well, I want to make it perfectly clear that I don't encourage
  or condone
  the bootlegging of recordings. When bands like Rat Dog and The Other
  Ones
  give their permission to tape their concerts, there is an implicit
  understanding that we do so only for our own listening and trading
  pleasure -
  not to profit from this by selling a copy of the tape afterwards.
  Ninety-five percent of all tapers are honest audio hobbyists who are
  only looking to record a unique audio event for their own listening
  enjoyment and have about as much
  in common with bootleggers as good doctors have with quacks.
  The great majority of us tapers agree that the selling of the music that
  a
  band allows us to tape for free is an extreme act of back-stabbing and
  is
  considered taboo. I say "let's use our heads," you know? All it takes is
  one
  bootleg CD from a recent taping-allowed show and the band could not
  allow
  taping from that moment on.
  The truth is, there are some dishonest people in any human endeavor or
  field
  of human interest. But, we certainly don't close our churches because
  there
  are some priests who are pedophiles.
  ME: No, I suppose not.
  HIPPIE: I believe allowing taping and encouraging tape-trading can be
  advantageous to the bands.
  First, it tends to increase their fan-base, mostly because the majority
  of

  Another point is that bootleggers tend to ignore laws and are not the
  kind of
  people who will wait until you allow taping before deciding to bootleg
  you.
  There's a saying that I put on all my tape covers: "In music there is
  peace... and in taping there is documentation... of unique sound
  events."
  I made that up myself.
  ME: Yeah. Can you move your car?
