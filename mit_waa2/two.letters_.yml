- From yet another perspective, perhaps "Pussy" is a nickname. In this day and age, we know that addressing people by their genitals is an unacceptable form of communication.

  DEAR MCSWEENEY'S,
  Having read the article, "Current Band Names Wondered About," by Jack
  Vaughn, I could not help but notice that the author has failed to
  recognize a valid explanation of the title "Bullets for Pussy." In the
  essay, I was made to believe that the name was used to imply a system of
  barter or trade (e.g., I will gladly offer a satisfactory number of
  bullets for the opportunity to pierce the thin delicate skin of one
  vagina with my presumably erect penis). I believe this to be an
  inaccurate explanation.
  I offer this: I believe that the title is meant to imply a provocative
  threat. In the spirit of such phrases as, "Here's a little kiss for
  daddy," or, "How about a little tongue for Mommy's rash," often heard
  falling from the clenched lips of stargazing lovers, I believe that the
  name "Bullets for Pussy" is to be viewed in the same light. One can see
  the parallels ("kiss for daddy," "tongue for mommy's rash," "bullets for
  pussy"). The bullets can even be viewed as a metaphor for the discharge
  emitted during times when such events transpire.
  From yet another perspective, perhaps "Pussy" is a nickname. In this day
  and age, we know that addressing people by their genitals is an
  unacceptable form of communication. However, the punk rock movement has,
  since its birth, prided itself on moving against the grain. "Pussy"
  therefore could be a person, not the organ, with this "Pussy" person
  being the recipient of the bullets.
  An even more interesting approach would be to view the vaginal organ as
  a weapon itself. It can be understood that the bullets, once obtained,
  will be held firmly in place by the vaginal walls and fired at
  unsuspecting victims. In this scenario, the cervical mucous would
  function as a sort of gun powder, filling in gaps and creating a vacuum
  of sorts, pushing air out of the opening and consequently propelling the
  lead fragments toward a decided target.
  The final question that I have concerning this topic is the term
  "pussy," and exactly to what physical characteristics it is ascribed. In
  parlance, a "pussy" is the actual vaginal opening. In a phrase as
  ambiguous as "Bullets for Pussy," we must be a bit clearer. It is in
  many cases possible to apply the term "pussy" to the entire vulvic
  region. This of course would include an area, not excluding the
  clitoris, labia (both majora and minora), vagina and perineum. Throw the
