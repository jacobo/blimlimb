- We sold the house and moved into a smaller house and then  into a large rented apartment, then into a smaller one.

- "We moved around  the city, fitting into smaller and smaller spaces, each time carrying our  valuables up and down stairways\x97the chests, the paintings, the family  china, the sofas, the wardrobes."

- We finally landed in the smallest studio  with the dog and our little cat and all of our furniture and light fixtures  and jewelry.
- |
  

- We laid out the expensive rugs one on top of another on the  floor.
- |
  

- We hung the paintings floor to low ceiling.
- |
  

- We sold our things off  one by one, peeled up a rug or took down a picture, and in this way we  paid the medical bills and the other bills and we lived, somewhat.
- |
  

- When  the floor and walls were bare and the room was mostly cleared out, my  father had one more thing to tell me.
- |
  

- Early in our marriage, he said, your  mother ran off with someone else and she came back pregnant.
- |
  

- You are  not my daughter.
- I felt that too.
- I was sixteen that year.

  FROM  VACATION .\n\

  I recall only one sentence that she said. She said it all the time. Every \n\
  day was an occasion. if she had to be away on a shoot, she said it to my \n\
  father. if i had to take cough syrup, she said it to me. She said it to the \n\
  family dog before his operation. it was her wisdom. She said it with \n\
  pride. What my mother said was: You won't even feel it. \n\
  i was born in the city. My father was a bank man, my mother starred \n\
  in soaps. We lived like the famous in a house by the park and i woke to a \n\
  vase of fresh tulips each day. We had long hallways and long tablecloths. \n\
  My mother had rooms full of clothes. So many strangers gave us presents \n\
  that we had a man to pen our thank-yous. Photographers slept outside \n\
  the house. one day when i was five, my mother was hit by a car and she felt it \n\
  and she died and we felt it. We went away for a while, paid off our debts \n\
  from afar, tried to live without her. We came back to the city. My father's \n\
  business spoiled dollar by dollar. We lived on her money. Each year we grew poorer. We sold the house and moved into a smaller house and then \n\
  into a large rented apartment, then into a smaller one. We moved around \n\

  with the dog and our little cat and all of our furniture and light fixtures \n\
  and jewelry. We laid out the expensive rugs one on top of another on the \n\
  floor. We hung the paintings floor to low ceiling. it was in this room \n\
  that my father became sick and couldn't work. We sold our things off \n\
  one by one, peeled up a rug or took down a picture, and in this way we \n\
