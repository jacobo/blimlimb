- How did things get this far?
- Scene Five.
- A MOBSTER
- Payback, sucker.
- A gun is fired.
- GREG PURCELL
- Yikes!
- "Scenes Six and Seven pretty much deal with the NEBULAE again, and all of the great things they talk about, about the state of the world and about what the people are doing there, and then there is even a funny part when they call upon PURCELL, in the form of a little star, to go back down and \"complete his mission on Earth,\" and using the word \"matter\" and \"energy\" as proper names, hilarious banter ensues along the lines of Abbott and Costello's \"Who's on First\" routine. Maybe CALIGULA makes an appearance. Maybe not. Finally, the credits flash and at the end a banner proclaims, IN MEMORIAM: CHARLES SCHULZ (1923-2000) and stays on the screen for an uncomfortably long time. Everyone leaves. The End."
