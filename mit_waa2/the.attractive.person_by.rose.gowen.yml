- The three of us hid when we saw her, but she came right in and made herself at home.
- |
  

- We heard the squeak of the springs when she settled into Father's chair.
- "\"Well, this was sure a good idea,\""
- |
  

- Mother whispered.
- |
  

- "\"Now what?"
- Father put his hand over Mother's mouth to quiet her, and we heard the springs decompressing, and then the sounds of the rockers on Mother's chair rocking against the floor.
- Mother pulled Father's hand off her mouth and whispered, "We can't just stay under here forever!
- "\" Father pinched her."
- We heard her high-heeled shoes tip-tapping around the living room.
- |
  

- Father pushed Mother and me out from under the bed.
- |
  

- He mouthed, "Quiet," and the three of us snuck out the back door and hid behind the snowball bush.
- "\"What are we going to do now, Mr. Brilliant?"
- "\" Mother said."
- |
  

- There was a dust bunny in her hair.
- |
  

- I tried to take it out, but she slapped my hand away.
- |
  

- "\"Stop that!"
- "\" she said."
- Father said, "If you'd both shut up a minute so I could think &#151; "
- "\"Next thing we know she'll be eating all our food,\""
- |
  

- Mother said.
- "\"Come on,\""
- |
  

- Father said.
- We squeezed along the space between the hedge and the fence, and out to the street.
- |
  

- We got into the car, and Father started it up.
- "\"It's because she's such an attractive person, she has this sense of entitlement,\""
- |
  

- Father said.
- |
  

- He was heading toward the freeway.
- "\"It's because she's an only child, she's a spoiled brat,\""
- |
  

- Mother said, and flipped open the vanity mirror to look at me in the back seat.
- "\"Where are we going?"
- "\" I said."
- "\"We'll stay in a motel tonight and go home tomorrow,\""
- |
  

- Father said.
- Father called our house in the morning, and she picked up the phone.
- |
  

- He hung up without saying a word.
- The next morning when Father called she asked, "Who is this?
- Father took a deep breath.
- "\"Who is this!"
- "\" she said."
- Father exhaled, and hung up.
- The third morning she said, "I don't know who you are, or why you're calling, but they're not here.
- |
  

- No one's here.
- |
  

- Now you have to stop bothering me.
