- What seems to be the problem today?
- |
  

- A question about one of your medications?
- |
  

- No? A question about something you saw on TV.
- |
  

- I see, a commercial.
- |
  

- He recommended you ask your doctor about .
- |
  

- The names  are  hard to remember.
- |
  

- A man running through a field.
- |
  

- OK, that narrows it down a little.
- |
  

- Was he running by himself, toward a woman at the other end of the field, or with a child?
- |
  

- By himself.
- |
  

- I see.
- |
  

- Was he harvesting something?
- |
  

- That could be an arthritis medication.
- |
  

- Just running.
- |
  

- OK, that's probably an allergy medicine.
- |
  

- Or something for depression.
- |
  

- An outside chance it was for attention deficit disorder or panic attacks.
- |
  

- I also wouldn't rule out a combination pill for any one of those problems plus prostate cancer.
- |
  

- Do you have allergies?
- |
  

- No. Well, then you don't need allergy medicine.
- |
  

- What else is on your mind?
- Another commercial.
- |
  

- Are there any health problems of your own you want to discuss?
- |
  

- No? Tell me about the commercial.
- |
  

- They told you to ask your doctor if "Procreator" is right for you? Is that really the name? Depending on the stressed syllable, it's either a fertility agent or a cholesterol pill. It might also be an attempt to reintroduce Quaaludes into the market. It has side effects including memory loss, limb atrophy, and  Weltschmerz . Well, what medicine doesn't, nowadays? It's either that or live with the sterility, take your pick.
- Two Greco-Roman wrestlers.
- |
  

- Interesting.
- |
  

- If they were elderly Greco-Roman wrestlers, that might be a pitch for those new growth-hormone supplements, but you're too young for that.
- |
  

- You're sure they were Greco-Roman?
- |
  

- There's an ad with women in Mexican wrestling masks for a pill treating stress incontinence.
- |
  

- I suggest patients avoid pro wrestling for a few months before trying that particular pill.
- What did the music sound like?
- |
  

- Pay attention to the key of the soundtrack.
- |
  

- Minor chords indicate one of the SSRIs; major chords suggest a cure for diabetes.
- |
  

- Any Philip Glass score is for an Alzheimer's drug.
- An obese man walking a dog?
- |
  

- Jolly-looking or overindulgent?
- |
  

- Jolly suggests one of the appetite stimulants or a cholesterol pill; overindulgent usually means you're looking at a gastrointestinal lipid-blocking agent, or a cholesterol pill.
- |
  

- Was the dog a schnauzer?
- |
  

- "I know that ad\x97it's actually for the dog."
- |
  

- You don't need heartworm pills.
- A man and woman shopping?
- |
  

- Erectile dysfunction.
- |
  

- Any commercial showing a man and woman washing dishes, sleeping fitfully, or rubbing their temples is also likely to be for erectile dysfunction.
- |
  

- Have you been having any problems .
- |
  

- No? Just asking.
- |
  

- You seem to be watching a lot of television.
- The jogger?
- |
  

- "You're on that pill\x97it's your blood-pressure pill."
- |
  

- There's another one with a teenager in chest pain, or the grandfather bungee-jumping.
- |
  

- You prefer the snowboarding pill?
- |
  

- Sure.
- |
  

- It's not on your insurance plan, but we can say you had some anal leakage with the other one and they'll cover it.
- |
  

- You  do  have leakage?
- |
  

- Well, switching won't help.
- |
  

- Did you try that medicine where the woman runs up the stairs?
- |
  

- I'll write you a prescription.
- The little girl lost in the woods isn't advertising anything for you.
- |
  

- It's a promotion for cosmetic appendix transplants, which are still in Phase III.
- |
  

- Stick with the one you have for now, and we'll talk it over next year.
- "The ad with the cells floating through the blood, zapping other cells\x97great special effects."
- |
  

- I don't know what the drug does, but we have some samples in the back if you'd like to try it out for a few weeks.
- A truck hanging by a single bolt?
- |
  

- That's a commercial for a truck.
- |
  

- Do you need a truck?
- |
