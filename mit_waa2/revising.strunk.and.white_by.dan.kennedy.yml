  REWRITING A FAMILIAR SENTENCE
  Suppose we take "These are the times that try men's souls." Here we have
  eight short, easy words forming a simple declarative sentence. Yet, in that
  arrangement they have shown great durability; this sentence written by
  Thomas Paine in 1776 is into its third century. Now compare a few less
  effective variations:
  These are times for soul men that are trying.
  I try so that men's souls feel it these times.
  It's hard out there, man...  and I'm looking for some times to keep my soul
  trying.

  USE THE ACTIVE VOICE
  The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive.
  I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.
  This is much better than:
  
   There was something pathetic about visiting her in, uh, that city...  and
  it will be sort of, you know, etched into my brain for eternity and recalled
  as this, like, basic response to anyone saying the name "Boston" or
   "Kristin". I mean, God help me if something painfully coincidental happens,
  you know, like somebody starts raving about their favorite bar in Boston
  named Kristin's... it'll induce, like, a... a seizure of nervous memories and
  sobbing in me, right in the middle of whatever dinner party it happens at,
  and everyone will assume something terrible happened to me in a bar or
  something... or that I have something against Boston.
