  PART 1: MIDDLEEARTH
  MiddleEarth plays all original songs based on the novels of J.R.R.
  Tolkien. They're sort of a cross between Kansas and Jethro Tull, with a little
  Blues Traveler thrown in (courtesy of my friend Tim, who looks and sounds like
  John Popper). MiddleEarth played last night at The Stars My Destination, a
  sci-fi/fantasy bookstore on Belmont, and Tim introduced the set by claiming
  that every note would be played on instruments native to the real Middle Earth. Everyone laughed and then, as the cool harmonics of MiddleEarth descended on us like the morning mist of Mirkwood, we began clapping and singing and bobbing our heads in a joyous unison.
  Early on, however, an unfortunate incident threatened to mar the
  evening. One girl was twirling so hard to "Wizard, Heal Thine Elf" that she
  tripped over a table of Anne McCaffery paperbacks, and opened up a nasty gash on her forehead. Overall her wounds were minor, but a guy in a cape, who called himself Grendel, said she was lucky: Had she crashed into the stacks just a few feet to the left, the life's work of Isaac Asimov almost certainly would have killed her.
  The band restarted the set with a shrieking piccolo solo in "Our Love's In Runes" followed immediately by the fist-raising anthem "Wargs (What Are They Good For?)." Tim closed with his usual dramatics, covering Led Zepplin's "Kashmir" and then returning to the stage for a single encore: a mournful medley of power ballads, including "One In a Silmarillion" and "You're a Hard Hobbit to Break." After the show, we drank until 3 am.
  The main topic of gossip was the ongoing pre-production of
  Hollywood's live-action Lord of the Rings. Tim plans to send the
  director a tape with a sampling of MiddleEarth's songs. It would be cool
