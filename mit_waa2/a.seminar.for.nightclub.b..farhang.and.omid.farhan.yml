- "You don't need to know my name\x97call me Mr. Break-Your-Neck-Two-Times, motherfuckers!"
- |
  

- Yeah, look at your shoes .
- |
  

- That's what I thought!

- There's no question that I'm in charge here and we just started.

- My 350-pound frame coupled with a natural look of general displeasure loan me a significant measure of alpha-male intimidation.
- |
  

- Plus, I'm black, which seems to scare the shit out of everybody.
- |

- "This, along with an ominous disposition, will have everyone around you treading cautiously like a bunch of eggs on stilts, which is a critical step for achieving Rule No. 3: AVOID GETTING HIT."
- Violence never solves anything.

- Now, maybe some of you young guys are thinking to yourselves, "Why shy away from the contact?
- |
  

- "Isn't the whole point to be justified in dropping the hammer on ex-frat boys who've had one too many J\xE4ger bombs?"
- "\" Well, I'm here to tell you, guys, being the tough guy is all fine and dandy until a nurse is picking shards of an Amstel Light bottle out of your skull with a sterile pair of needle-nose tweezers."
- |
  

- Not fun.
- |
  

- The guy in Row 2 with the lightning-bolt-shaped scar across the side of his face knows what I'm talking about.
- |
  

- "Don't smile, fucko\x97this isn't funny."
- And with the growing popularity of this damn ultimate fighting, the rules of engagement have been redefined.
- |
  

- Now any Joe wearing khakis could possess the skill set of a Brazilian jujitsu master.
- |
  

- "One second you're telling Chadwick that he can't take his drink outside; next thing you know, Royce Gracie's prot\xE9g\xE9's got his legs wrapped around your neck like an anaconda, choking you out."
- |
  

- For $10 an hour, you can keep that shit.
- "Moving on to Rule No. 4: YOU MUST BE PISSED OFF."
- |
  

- Once the earpiece is in, you have to be on.
- |
  

- Who here is familiar with the concept of method acting .
- |
  

- OK.
- |
  

- Before work, try conjuring a notable achievement from your past.
- |
  

- Nothing gets me in the mood like thinking about the award I won playing high-school football for Most Time Spent in the Weight Room.
- |
  

- And make sure your physique is in proper order.
- |
  

- Keep dumbbells in your car and do curls during your break to get the pump.
- |
  

- If you don't want to lug around dumbbells, doing pushups in the alley is a suitable alternative.
- Follow these rules and, I promise you, you will enjoy a long, confrontation-free career of keeping the club safe so that people can get cross-eyed drunk with minimal risk to their persons.
- |
  

- Now my time is up, but if there's anything you'd like to talk about in further detail, please do not hesitate to introduce yourself during the 5 p.m.

- Grand Canyon Room.
