- Dear Antidisestablishmentarianism,
- Oh come on.
- |
  

- You're not a word, you're an event.
- |
  

- How can you be so concerned with your own very particular meaning?
- |
  

- How can a word that looks like you mean anything but 'Look at me'?
- Look at you &#151; those mutually negating prefixes.
- |
  

- Why not cut them loose and spare us the syllables?
- |
  

- Look at your suffixes, shuffling stiffly into place like men arranging themselves for a group photo.
- |
  

- You're like the uncle who thinks he's charismatic but is just drunk.
- |
  

- You're like the unreconstructed sentimentalist neighbor who, Christmas after Christmas, goes too far with the lights.
- |
  

- Ten years from now, seeing the Polaroids, will you be proud of that outfit?
- |
  

- You're like a plate of toothpaste.
- Or perhaps you haven't gone far enough.
- |
  

- Why not 'Antidisestablishmentarianismboutrosboutrospleasemakefunofme'?
- |
  

- If you insist.
- |
  

- Four i's.
- |
  

- Ha ha!
- |
  

- I can't see the four s's for the t's.
- |
  

- Ho ho!
- |
  

- Sorry for the irreverence.
- |
  

- I know how "anti-diss" you are. OOOOOOOOHHHH. Speaking of o's, where are they? Did you not have room? Methlychloroisothiazolinone manages five. What's up with you? And u? Shut up before I set a drink on  you. Shut up before I ride you down to my favorite drinking establishment... What's your position on those, again?
- Antidisestabetcetera, you're too much.
- |
  

- Please desist.
- |
  

- Disest.
- |
  

- Shut up before I smack the shment out of you.
- |
  

- "That reminds me: Do you remember that Danger Bob song, Real World Me'?"
- Take the 'o' out of 'Cory',
- Take the 'o' out of 'Cory',
- Take the 'o' out of 'Cory',
- |
  

- Cry'.
- That was good.
- |
  

- They were a good band.
- |
  

- Too bad they disestablished.
- |
  

- So what else is going on?
- Love,

  Dear Antidisestablishmentarianism,
  Oh come on. You're not a word, you're an event. How can you be so
  concerned
  with your own very particular meaning? How can a word that looks like
  you
  mean anything but 'Look at me'?
  Look at you &#151; those mutually negating prefixes. Why not cut them loose
  and
  spare us the syllables? Look at your suffixes, shuffling stiffly into
  place
  like men arranging themselves for a group photo. You're like the uncle
  who
  thinks he's charismatic but is just drunk. You're like the
  unreconstructed
  sentimentalist neighbor who, Christmas after Christmas, goes too far
  with
  the lights. Ten years from now, seeing the Polaroids, will you be proud
  of
  that outfit? You're like a plate of toothpaste.
  Or perhaps you haven't gone far enough. Why not
  'Antidisestablishmentarianismboutrosboutrospleasemakefunofme'? If you
  insist. Four i's. Ha ha! I can't see the four s's for the t's. Ho ho!
  Sorry
  for the irreverence. I know how "anti-diss" you are. OOOOOOOOHHHH.
  Speaking
  of o's, where are they? Did you not have room?
  Methlychloroisothiazolinone
  manages five. What's up with you? And u? Shut up before I set a drink on
  
  you. Shut up before I ride you down to my favorite drinking
  establishment... What's your position on those, again?
  Antidisestabetcetera, you're too much. Please desist. Disest. Shut up
  before I smack the shment out of you. That reminds me: Do you remember
  that
  Danger Bob song, Real World Me'?
  Take the 'o' out of 'Cory',
  Take the 'o' out of 'Cory',
  Take the 'o' out of 'Cory',
  and make her 'Cry'.
  That was good. They were a good band. Too bad they disestablished. So
  what
  else is going on?
  Love,
  E
