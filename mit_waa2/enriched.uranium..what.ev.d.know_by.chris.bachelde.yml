- Parents, if the answer to one or more of the following questions is "yes," your child may be experimenting with enriched uranium.       Does my child seem sullen or moody?    Does my child seem to spend a lot of time in his room with the door closed and locked?    Does my child often wear rubber gloves and surgical masks?

Has my child constructed any isotope-separation schemes (such as a centrifuge, an electromagnetic field, a diffusion device, or a laser) in the house or garage?     Does my child have kidney problems?
