- I was in the locker room, taking off my shoes, humming a Procol Harum song, and thinking about how I should have passed the ball off rather than taken that final shot when Bob walked in, clearing his throat like he had something to say.
- |
  

- Bob's a bluff little guy with a marine cut who loves to be the one with news.
- |
  

- "\"Hey,\""
- |
  

- "\"Guess what?"
- |
  

- Pete was saying that you have a secret agenda.
- I laughed thinly.
- "\"Yeah,\""
- |
  

- "\"Can you believe it?"
- |
  

- He was saying it over by the squash courts.
- |
  

- To everyone.
- Bob went to the shower, and I sat down and stared at the pattern in the tile.
- |
  

- Up until that moment, I had accounted Pete an idiot.
- |
  

- An idiot who I pretended to be friends with at the gym, maybe, but still an idiot.
- |
  

- This, however, made me reconsider.
- |
  

- How could he know about my hidden agenda?
- I'm sure I'm not the only guy in the world harboring secret plans.
- |
  

- But it puts me up a tree to be exposed that way, over by the squash courts.
- |
  

- If I'm going to be accused, I'd rather just confess.
- |
  

- That's how I like it.
- |
  

- So sue me.
- For starters, I have spent the last three months persuading my brother and his wife, Ellen, who are music snobs, that the new Shania Twain record is not just a guilty pleasure but a really good album.
- |
  

- After a few false starts, it worked like a charm.
- |
  

- Just last weekend, Ellen called me up to thank me for buying it for them.
- |
  

- "\"At first I thought two copies was a little crazy,\""
- |
  

- "\"but now we have one for the car and one for the house."
- |
  

- You're right.
- |
  

- It's great.
- |
  

- It pushed the new Springsteen right out of heavy rotation.
- "\" All this is just the top layer of the agenda onion, though, because what lies beneath is the fact that I want Ellen, who works for a regional electronics company, to get me a new DVD player."
- |
  

- I figure that if I start giving them presents they appreciate, it's only a matter of time before they respond in kind.
- |
  

- Along those lines, I also managed to get Fiesta Bowl tickets for this friend of a friend who always has good stock tips, even though it involved a bit of deceit; I had to pretend to like my new neighbor Eric, when in fact I can't stand the way he smokes a pipe like he's goddamn Fred McMurray or something.
- |
  

- It was way worth it, though.
- |
  

- Eric said that I could use his grill any time I wanted, and his friend, the guy I got the Fiesta Bowl tickets for, is considering tipping me off to some biotech stocks.
- So that's part of it.
- |
  

- I can't say I'm particularly ashamed.
- |
  

- I'm getting some positive results.
- |
  

- The rest of the agenda, though, is a mess.
- |
  

- I have been trying to convince this woman who works at the bank to go on a date with me.
- |
  

- Once I sauntered up the counter and said, "Where can a guy get a drink around here?
- "\" She just said, \""
- Water fountain in the corner, sir.
- "\" She didn't even look up."
- |
  

- There's also this small matter of staying friends, but not close friends, with a woman I dated last year for a little while.
- |
  

- It didn't work out.
- |
  

- But she's a fantastic cook, and if I could somehow finagle a dinner invitation once a month or so I'd be in heaven.
- |
  

- The last time I called her up and hinted that I'd like to see her, she was suspicious and then angry.
- |
  

- Both, I thought, were overreactions, and both made me despair for future meals.
- That's just the snout of the pig, as they say.
- |
  

- "My son, who is seventeen, has a new girlfriend, and I can't say that I approve, although it's really my ex-wife's fault: she didn't tell me that he was spending three or four nights a week at the girlfriend's house until it was too late."
- |
  

- I wish that would stop.
- |
  

- I want Eric to recognize that if I wanted to go over to his house and watch hockey, I would have done so already, and to lay off all future invitations.
- |
  

- "Oh, and one more thing: I also need my sister and her rich husband to buy themselves a new car so I can take the old one off their hands."
- |
  

- It's a ninety-six, I think, but a BMW is a BMW.
- Well, that's it.
- |
  

- I hope Pete's happy now.
