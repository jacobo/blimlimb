- Lipton PureLeaf
- Unsweetened Iced Tea,
- New Jersey, 2007
- Refreshing, citrusy, with a clean and bracing herbal finish.
- "Pairs with:"
- Swordfish, chicken salad, and that tangerine-flavored lip-balm kiss we shared in the park on our first date.
- |
  

- San Pellegrino Limonata
- Sparkling Lemon Beverage, Italy, 2007
- Bright, high in carbonation, and packed with 12 percent lemon juice.
- |
  

- A truly joyous drink, it revives and elevates the senses.
- "Pairs with:"
- "The Saturday we watched  Am\xE9lie , remember?"
- |
  

- About halfway through, you said you forgot you were even reading the subtitles, and I said I felt the same way, and we connected, and it was totally great.
- Also, ravioli.
- |
  

- Lindemans Bin 45 Cabernet Sauvignon,
- Southeastern Australia, 2003
- Like most Australian Cabs, this lower-priced offering from Lindemans features a robust earthiness and impressive balance.
- |
  

- This particular Cabernet Sauvignon also has a mouth feel that is strikingly smooth and rich .
- |
  

- God, I miss that spot.
- "Pairs with:"
- Pungent cheeses, lamb, beef, and regret.
- |
  

- Original Green River
- Caffeine-Free Lime Soda,
- Illinois, 2006-or-2007-ish
- Made with natural lime oils.
- |
  

- Dark, thick, and perhaps overly sweet, Green River leaves an unpleasant sugary slick on the back of one's throat.
- "Pairs with:"
- Salted popcorn, basically anything by Lean Cuisine, and that night I apparently said too much and screwed up everything between us.
- |
  

- Stupid.
- |
  

- Stupid!
- |
  

- Dean's Grade A
- Half & Half, Illinois, 2007
- Thick, silky, and sultry.
- |
  

- Full of lactose and saturated fat.
- "Pairs with:"
- "Sumatran dark-roasted coffees, Earl Grey teas, and\x97at a full 20 calories per tablespoon\x97is great on its own, right out of the bottle and into my mouth, because I don't care about myself or how I look or whether or not you care, either, OK?"
- |
  

- I. Don't.
- |
  

- Care.
- Really.
- |
  

- Absopure Natural Spring Water,
- Michigan, 2007
- You remember Michigan, don't you?
- |
  

- We counted seagulls .
- |
  

- There were 39 in that one parking lot.
- |
  

- Thirty-nine!
- |
  

- God, with you, I could have counted them forever.
- |
  

- Michigan seagulls.
- "Pairs with:"
- My saline tears.
- |
  

- Makes an excellent gargle.
- |
  

- Bruce Foods "The Perfect Louisiana" Hot Sauce,
- Louisiana, probably sometime in 2003
- Not traditionally a beverage, but the searing pain it causes as it drips down my throat takes my mind off the bleeding hole in my chest where my heart used to be.
- Come back with my heart!
- "Pairs with:"
- Louisiana Chicken Wings (recipe available on Bruce Foods "The Perfect Louisiana" Hot Sauce bottle, or write to Bruce Foods Corporation, P.O. Drawer 1030, New Iberia, LA 70562-1030).
- |
  

- V8 V.Fusion Tropical Orange,
- New Jersey, Expired 2/19/06
- Sort of chunky.
- |
  

- Tastes a little like pasta sauce.
- |
  

- I found it in the back of my refrigerator while searching for the rolls of film we took on our trip to the zoo.
- |
  

- That was, jeez, a year ago, maybe more.
- |
  

- But the film should be fine.
- |
  

- You liked the zebras, I remember.
- "Pairs with:"
- Zebra meat.
- |
  

- Duracell Coppertop
- AA Battery Acid Drippings,
- Scraped From Long-Forgotten Mini-Flashlight
- |
  

- Junk Drawer, Yesterday
- Tingly and bitter, I bet.
- |
  

- You don't think I'll do it, do you?
- "Pairs with:"
- The day I actually do it.
- |
  

- I swear to you, I'll do it.
- Oh.
- |
  

- Oh, God.
- |
  

- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- It's just that .
- |
  

- I'm in a really bad place right now, baby.
- |
  

- A bad place.
- |
  

- I'm .
- |
  

- I'm so sorry.
- |
  

- Can I call you sometime?
- |
  

- Svedka Citron
- Lemon Flavored Vodka,
- Sweden, 2005
- It burns, but I like it.
- "Pairs with:"
- Sitting under your window ledge at 3 in the morning, nose pressed up against the glass, swilling it while I watch my breath make tiny clouds on your bedroom window.
- No, don't wake up .
- |
  

- Go to sleep, baby .
- |
  

- Sleep sweetly.
- |
  

- What are you doing?
- |
  

- No, babe.
- |
  

- Get back in bed.
- |
  

- Don't look this way.
- |
  

- Baby?
- |
  

- Where are you going?
- |
  

- Baby, it's just me!
- |
  

- Don't panic!
- |
  

- What are you looking for?
- |
  

- Who are you calling?
- |
  

- Stop yelling!
- |
  

- Stop!
- Baby, I brought some Svedka!
- |
  

- We can make screwdrivers, baby!
- |
  

- Baby?
