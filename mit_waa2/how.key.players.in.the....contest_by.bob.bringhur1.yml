  James Baker begins his performance in a narrow spotlight. He is tucked into
  a ball until Wild Cherry's "Play That Funky Music" begins. The former
  Secretary of State uncurls himself slowly, menacingly, and begins to whirl
  across the stage. The tempo increases as Baker moves into a lindy circle
  followed by a swing out. The spotlight can barely stay with him. When the
  song ends, he stops, licks his fingers, and slaps the buttocks of an
  imaginary partner. The spotlight fades as Baker curls himself into a ball.
  Brazen.
  David Gergen performs a no-nonsense shuffle step to Boxcar Willie's "Achy
  Breaky Heart." Midway through the song, he dabs his nose with an argyle
  handkerchief. Subtle, delicate, and unforced.
  Al Gore's dance begins with promise as the techno sounds of Devo's "Big
  Mess" charge the atmosphere. Gore performs a robotic fall-off-the-log move
  that consists of a rock-step-stop followed by a kick-back-side-front. He
  forces a smile, and then repeats the fall-off-the-log move several times.
  The song ends, the lights fade, and the Vice President is still falling off
  the log. His performance shows a large degree of artistic intent and a
  small degree of artistic realization.
  George W. Bush strolls onto the stage wearing a lumberjack shirt, leotards,

  The senior George Bush interacts with stage props while reading dramatic
  poetry. First poem, hands clasped beneath chin:

  William Daley performs the "Soundtrack Medley." Sporting skin-tight leather

  stomach and thighs to "Maniac." Water trickles over his body; he wheels and
  pounds his forearms against a chair. He stops, looks wildly left and right,
  and then moves into a "stud strut" as "Stayin' Alive" sweeps across the
  stage. Quick but effective tributes to "Fame" and "Dirty Dancing" leave the
  audience agape, but Daley offers the true show-stopper when he waves his
  hands quickly back and forth across his face, alternately revealing and
