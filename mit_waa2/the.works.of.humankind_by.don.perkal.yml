- A DISPATCH BY  DON PERKAL
- |
  

- WASHINGTON, D.C.
- |
  

- The airliner crashed between two and three hundred feet from my office in the Pentagon, just around a corner from where I work.
- |
  

- I'm the deputy General Counsel, Washington Headquarters Services, Office of the Secretary of Defense.
- |
  

- A slightly different calibration and I have no doubt I wouldn't be sending this to you.
- |
  

- My colleagues felt the impact, which reminded them of an earthquake.
- |
  

- People shouted in the corridor outside that a bomb had gone off upstairs on the main concourse in the building.
- |
  

- No alarms sounded.
- |
  

- I walked to my office, shut down my computer, and headed out.
- |
  

- Even before stepping outside I could smell the cordite.
- |
  

- Then I knew explosives had been set off somewhere.
- I looked to my right and saw a raging fire and smoke careening off the facade to the sky.
- One of the attorneys who works for me called in sick Tuesday.
- |
  

- The satellite office he works in was utterly destroyed.
- |
  

- His wife and child will hug him more tightly tonight.
- Another friend, who works for a government contractor in the Army section of the Pentagon that took a direct hit, crawled out of what was his office to safety.
- People walked around in a daze, looking at the gaping hole and flames, appearing uncomprehending.
- |
  

- The skies, normally leaden with commercial jets, were empty.
- |
  

- Helicopters circled the building and an occasional F-16 streaked by.
- |
  

- Sirens blared from what seemed hundreds of emergency vehicles.
- |
  

- I lost count of the hook and ladder companies.
- |
  

- People left their vehicles in the parking lot and started walking the bridges towards D.C.
- |
  

- Hundreds of F.B.
- I.
- |
  

- Secret Service and Defense Department plainclothes investigators were deployed in the parking lot, recording witness statements.
- |
  

- Photographers by the dozen made their way to as close to the flames as they could bear.
- Two explosions, a few minutes apart, prompted me to start walking.
- |
  

- I walked for three miles past office buildings, restaurants and shopping malls.
- |
  

- Everything was closing down, public transportation ceased, people were milling about the streets unsure of what to do.
- |
  

- Cells phones stopped working, and traffic was total gridlock.
- |
  

- As I walked along, I heard the bad news from car radios.
- |
  

- Reaching U.S.
- |
  

- Route 1, I approached a young man in a pickup and asked him if he was headed towards Alexandria.
- |
  

- He gave me a ride although he hadn't planned to travel that way.
- |
  

- We traveled five miles in two-and-one-half hours.
- |
  

- When he got close, I thanked him, left, and walked the last mile home.
- |
  

- I'm still processing the events of this past Tuesday.
- |
  

- On Wednesday I went into work but in the early afternoon we were told to evacuate the building because an unidentified plane was making its way to Washington.
- |
  

- It later proved to be a plane chartered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
- |
  

- Everyone went home early.
- On Thursday, we were all still numb.
- |
  

- We spent almost the entire day consoling each other.
- An attorney I've known for fifteen years was killed instantly when the plane went into the building.
- |
  

- He had retired two weeks ago and went to work for a government contractor.
- |
  

- He was in the Pentagon to pitch a contract to a Lieutenant General.
- |
  

- Everyone in the room died from the explosion of jet fuel.
- A woman I met told me that on Tuesday morning she went to get a cup of coffee.
- |
  

- When she tried to return to her office, it was gone and two of her colleagues were gone as well.
- Friends of mine had relatives or business associates who worked in the World Trade Center.
- A month ago, while in New York City, my granddaughter and I decided to go to the observation deck of the World Trade Center.
- |
  

- "As we were riding up the escalator to the mezzanine to purchase the tickets, a thought occurred to me: how misguided the terrorists were who attempted to bring down an indestructible building by setting off a truck bomb in the basement."
- |
  

- So much for the works of humankind.
