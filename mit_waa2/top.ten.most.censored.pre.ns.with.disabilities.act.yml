  NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- A study presented today at the
  American Academy of Ophthalmology's Annual Meeting found women with
  strabismus, a condition in which one eye either turns in toward the nose
  or out toward the temple, were the least likely to be hired for a
  management position.
  Authors David K. Coats, M.D., Evelyn A. Paysse, M.D., Annette J.
  Towler, MA, and Robert L. Dipboye, Ph.D. digitally manipulated the
  photos of two men and two women to create the effect of strabismus, then
  randomly assigned them to mock job resumes. The resumes were for a job
  as a marketing manager. The resumes and photos of seven applicants were
  given to participants who were asked to rank them in order of hiring
  preference.
  Authors found male applicants with normal eyes ranked an average of
  5.09, while men with strabismic eyes ranked 5.77 (when eye was turned
  in) and 4.90 (when eye was turned out). However, women with strabismus
  ranked 3.50 and 3.64 respectively, while women with normal eyes ranked
  5.70.
  Based on the study's findings that strabismus negatively affects a
  woman's ability to secure a management position, the authors suggest
  strabismus should be considered a disability under the Americans with
  Disabilities Act, rather than a cosmetic problem.
  The mission of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the largest
  medical association of ophthalmologists, the Eye M.D.s, is to achieve
  accessible, appropriate, and affordable eye care for the public by
  serving the educational and professional needs of the ophthalmologist.
