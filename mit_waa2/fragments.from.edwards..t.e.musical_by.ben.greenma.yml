- |
  

- Here, put this vest on.
- Then let's try a  Top Gun  thing.
- You can stand by a plane and lean on the wing.

- This isn't  TMZ .
- |

- JOHN EDWARDS  denies it.
- |

- I can't abide
- These filthy lies.
- They interfere
- With my career.
- I am no philanderer,
- But you, sir, are a slanderer.
- |
  

- ELIZABETH EDWARDS  refuses to deal directly with the concerns.
- |
  

- ELIZABETH EDWARDS
- I've been largely private since this campaign began.
- That's how I choose to stand by my man.
- Plus, I have more pressing concerns,
- Like making sure that no cancer returns.
- I'm feeling tired and not all that well.
- I think that I'll go lie down for a spell.
- |
  

- DAVID PEREL  publishes a second story, naming  RIELLE HUNTER  as  JOHN EDWARDS 's mistress and reporting that she is six months pregnant, possibly with  EDWARDS 's child.
- |
  

- A few months later, after limited success in the primary season,  JOHN EDWARDS  drops out of the presidential race.
- |
  

- JOHN EDWARDS
- I am ending my campaign,
- But not my fight for the working poor.

- I'll make sure the poor are not neglected.
- I'll keep them in the public vision.

- |
  

- Fred Baron,  JOHN EDWARDS 's former campaign-finance chairman, pays  RIELLE HUNTER 's moving expenses and rent.
- |
  

- RIELLE HUNTER
- Is this hush money?
- JOHN EDWARDS
- Of course not, honey.
- I just know that moving can be a beast.
- It costs as much as a haircut, at least.
- |
  

- DAVID PEREL  learns that  JOHN EDWARDS  is visiting  RIELLE HUNTER  at the Beverly Hills Hilton and sets up an ambush in the hotel.
- |
  

- When  JOHN EDWARDS  sees them, he flees to the bathroom.
- |
  

- REPORTER
- Mr. Edwards, come out.
- We live in a democracy.
- Information is the tonic
- That corrects hypocrisy.
- JOHN EDWARDS
- Oh, of course, yes.
- |
  

- "I agree\x97uh,"
- It's just that I have diarrhea.
- |
  

- JOHN EDWARDS  makes fake diarrhea noises to scare off the reporters.
- |
  

- REPORTER
- I don't get paid enough
- To deal with this stuff.
- |
  

- JOHN EDWARDS  confesses the affair to ABC News, but insists that he does not love  RIELLE HUNTER  and that he is not the father of her baby.
- |
  

- ELIZABETH EDWARDS
- Don't give credit to this rumor.
- Gossip spreads just like a tumor.
- |
  

- TUMOR  awakens.
- |
  

- TUMOR
- Hello?
- |
  

- Did someone call me?
- I think I dozed off at my post.
- Is there an organ that needs ruining
- Or some blood to turn against the host?
- ELIZABETH EDWARDS
- This is totally bizarre.
- Are you who I think you are?
- TUMOR
- "Hold on a second\x97"
- I'll be right back.
- I have to make
- A sneak attack.
- |
  

- TUMOR  finds  JOHN EDWARDS  in his office.

- That you'll stay with your wife
- Until I convey her
- Away from this life?
- JOHN EDWARDS
- I was blinded by fame,
- By applause and acclaim.
- Over time, I became
- Immune to shame.
- TUMOR
- Yes, yes,
- I know
- Your rationalization.
- I've heard it.
- It's disinformation.
- "I'm asking something different now:"
- Whether you can truly vow
- To be loyal in the days ahead,
- Before the Fates snip your wife's thread.
- |
  

- TUMOR  picks up the telephone and holds it out to  JOHN EDWARDS .

- Call her.
- Tell her.
- Quell her
- Fears.

- By you
- All these
- Years.
- JOHN EDWARDS
- I never meant to humiliate her.
- I was a freshman legislator.
- TUMOR

- RIELLE HUNTER
- Really?
- |
  

- You mean it?
- John, I'm so pleased.
- We have a special synergy,
- And your wife has bad energy.
- JOHN EDWARDS
- What?
- |
  

- Who's this?
- Something's amiss.
- |
  

- Unbeknownst to  JOHN EDWARDS ,  TUMOR  has tampered with the telephone so that both  ELIZABETH EDWARDS  and  RIELLE HUNTER  are on the line.
- |
  

- ELIZABETH EDWARDS
- I'm calling a divorce attorney.
- RIELLE HUNTER
