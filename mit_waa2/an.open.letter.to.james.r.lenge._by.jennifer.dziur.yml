- Dear James Randi,
- I am writing to you in regard to your offer of $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate, under proper conditions of scientific trial, paranormal abilities.
- |
  

- I deeply admire your policy of holding those who claim to possess supernatural powers to the rigorous standards of scientific inquiry and rational thought by working with these claimants to develop a preliminary, and then a formal, test of those abilities.
- The warning, posted so ominously (and, dare I say, smugly) on your website, that "no one has ever passed the preliminary tests" only deepens my conviction to be the first.
- Delightfully, I have not only a love for the scientific method but also a demonstrable paranormal skill!
- |
  

- I have the ability to control men's minds with my vagina.
- "To test the claim that I can control men's minds with my vagina, I propose the following experiment:"
- A statistically significant even number of volunteers will be recruited to participate in the test.
- |
  

- Volunteers should be male, heterosexual, and unknown to me, and should have at least $5 on their person.
- |
  

- "Each volunteer will be assigned to a group: \"vagina\" or \"no vagina."
- In every trial, the volunteer will be seated within a short walking distance of a hamburger stand.
- |
  

- Volunteers in the "vagina" group will also be seated within a short walking distance of my vagina. Volunteers in the "no vagina" group will have a leaden wall placed between them and my vagina.
- |
  

- To ensure that the "no vagina" group is not motivated by even the suggestion of my vagina, I will not be seen by them, and my voice will be conveyed only through a voice-altering device that masks my gender.
- For each trial, I will ask the volunteer if he will buy me a hamburger.
- I predict that volunteers in visual proximity of my vagina will be at least 50 percent more likely to comply than those separated from my vagina by a leaden barrier.
- I think you will agree that mind control of any kind is certainly a paranormal phenomenon, and that this proposal represents a fair test of my ability to control men's minds with my vagina.
- "As anecdotal evidence\x97which I am aware is not sufficient for your challenge but seems apropos in an introductory note such as this\x97I have previously obtained a number of hamburgers in this manner."
- Sincerely,

  Dear James Randi,\n\
  I am writing to you in regard to your offer of $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate, under proper conditions of scientific trial, paranormal abilities. I deeply admire your policy of holding those who claim to possess supernatural powers to the rigorous standards of scientific inquiry and rational thought by working with these claimants to develop a preliminary, and then a formal, test of those abilities.\n\
  The warning, posted so ominously (and, dare I say, smugly) on your website, that \"no one has ever passed the preliminary tests\" only deepens my conviction to be the first.\n\
  Delightfully, I have not only a love for the scientific method but also a demonstrable paranormal skill! I have the ability to control men's minds with my vagina.\n\
  To test the claim that I can control men's minds with my vagina, I propose the following experiment:\n\
  A statistically significant even number of volunteers will be recruited to participate in the test. Volunteers should be male, heterosexual, and unknown to me, and should have at least $5 on their person. Each volunteer will be assigned to a group: \"vagina\" or \"no vagina.\"\n\
  In every trial, the volunteer will be seated within a short walking distance of a hamburger stand. Volunteers in the \"vagina\" group will also be seated within a short walking distance of my vagina. Volunteers in the \"no vagina\" group will have a leaden wall placed between them and my vagina. To ensure that the \"no vagina\" group is not motivated by even the suggestion of my vagina, I will not be seen by them, and my voice will be conveyed only through a voice-altering device that masks my gender.\n\
  For each trial, I will ask the volunteer if he will buy me a hamburger.\n\
  I predict that volunteers in visual proximity of my vagina will be at least 50 percent more likely to comply than those separated from my vagina by a leaden barrier.\n\
  I think you will agree that mind control of any kind is certainly a paranormal phenomenon, and that this proposal represents a fair test of my ability to control men's minds with my vagina.\n\
