- GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA &#151; I came to sunny Florida for the cure, but a dreary wet cold snapped and doused Spring Break, sending students skulking around Gainesville like shellshocked sand crabs.
- |
  

- Tugging at suddenly pointless tube tops, chewing their puka &#151; the UF students' bummer gloom hung like a wet bathing suit over the entire town.
- It was an inflamed red boredom, that void that sunburn and herpes did not fill.
- |
  

- Around then I saw three cretins go for the throat of the local homeless diabetic amputee.
- |
  

- He had been begging quarters near their campus.
- |
  

- He had made the mistake of being wheelchair bound while wearing a Georgia Bulldogs cap.
- "\"Spare some change?"
- "\" he said."
- "\"Not in that hat,\""
- |
  

- They high-fived profusely before piling into their own shining wheels and roaring off.
- |
  

- No time to tell them of their own bubbling sugar and brewers yeast levels.
- |
  

- Gathering gangrene.
- Near Gainesville parched alligator babies swelter on the edge of the highway in Paine's dried-up Prairie.
- |
  

- Someone drove me in a minivan to the outskirts of town to see the baby alligators' dessication and called it fun.
- |
  

- Whole Florida families brought kiddies to watch the alligators huffing the dust of their parched swamp.
- What I didn't say everyone must have already known deep in their own reptile hearts.
- |
  

- "That's why they'd brought coolers and grandma and Coleman fold-out chairs: Soon the alligators would commence the long tough chew."
- |
  

- Head to tail, doing each other the favor of a moist, salivous death.
- |
  

- It was the last tailgater of the season.
- |
  

- What's healing about Florida?
- |
  

- I have a month to wonder.
- |
  

- It's such a predator-friendly put-up-or-shut-up place.
- |
  

- Where I am in Gainesville, 1960s settlers tried to make the south safe for hippies and gay folks, and failed.
- |
  

- Yet Ted Bundy and magnet healers, Gray Panthers and Jeb Bushes still arrive hopeful every day.
- |
  

- Convenience counters stock breathalyzer strips next to Goodie's Headache Powder, and the local hospital gets emergency blue girls all the time.
- |
  

- I'm taking the cure in the land of Rohypnol and tanning beds, the city of shave your eyebrows off and then crayon them back on.
- |
  

- Full body waxing.
- Danny Rollins has his own commemorative hacked sorority sister wall here.
- |
  

- For thirty-two days, I drive by the wall on the way to my cure sessions.
- |
  

- One way people here know I'm sick is that I think things are not nice.
- |
  

- I don't like this cement wall of a tribute painted black with WE'LL ALWAYS [heart] YA in blood red bubble letters.
- "\"That sucks  and  freaks me out,\""
- |
  

- I mention to someone's mother.
- "\"Really?"
- "\" she said diplomatically."
- |
  

- "\"I guess you had to be there."
- |
  

- I think it's sweet.
- |
  

- On the first day of the cure I try to visit Sunland.
- |
  

- No Mapquest or MRI or Cat Scan or Lonely Planet guide can assess my chances.
- |
  

- "How to see where a town's healing heart lies: visit their institution for the mentally retarded close-up."
- Asking directions, I found out that the improvement people had gotten there first.
- |
  

- That my Sunland 5-K Run T-shirt had turned into one of those air-brushed Lil' Boo tribute T's you get made in New Orleans East after your cousin gets shot &#151; a dead man's shirt.
- "\"You mean Taco Charlie's?"
- "\" a woman behind a cash register said."
- |
  

- "\"Where you been?"
- |
  

- They done been changed that name.
- |
  

- Sunland hasn't been Sunland for years.
- When I arrived at the razor-wired compound, Taco Charlie was spelled Tachachalee, in honor of Gainesville's first genocided tribe.
- |
  

- All of a sudden Sunland must have sounded too Wikki Wakki to someone administrating from Tallahassee.
- |
  

- Sunland is where you go for water skiing and cotton candy and synchronized swimming.
- |
  

- "Sunland is Cypress Gardens: you bring a cooler and a ratty old Garfield beach towel and you keep your kids."
- |
  

- Sunland is not a one-way destination.
- |
  

- Maybe all the way to the state capitol they felt the heatwaves coming off the sweltering lie.
- |
  

- Or didn't want tourists stopping on their way to Disney by mistake.
- Driving up to Tachachalee I was surprised with chain link fences nearly as high as those at Angola and a guardhouse complete with a guard with a gun who was actually guarding.
- |
  

- Even at the largest institutions near my home in Louisiana, the wooden guardhouses by the road stand traditionally and pointedly empty &#151; a ghosted ramshackle joke.
- |
  

- This is where we house broken people.
- |
  

- Who wants in?
- But the Taco Charlie guard was young and proud of himself.
- |
  

- A blond stubbled boy scout.
- |
  

- He leaned out his police shack to peer in my car.
- "\"Can I help you?"
- "\"I'm here to see my cousin,\""
- |
  

- I came up with.
- |
  

- "\"I forget what cottage he's in."
- Usually that would suffice to get me the wave-through, have a good one.
- |
  

- But no go.
- "\"Oh I can look him up for you."
- |
  

- No problem.
- |
  

- They don't like you to just drive around,"
- |
  

- "\"What'd you say his name was?"
- "\"Davey Smith,\""
- |
  

- I decided, hoping some Davey Smith might be pleasantly surprised to see me.
- "\"You said  Davey  Smith?"
- "\" The guard said, flipping a few pages and shaking his head."
- "\"He's been here like forever,\""
- |
  

- I lie.
- |
  

- "\"They probably have him under another Smith."
- |
  

- Like David or Michael or Bruce.
- He looked up David or Michael or Bruce and then dialed the operator to check.
- |
  

- His lip beaded salt water as he stepped in and out of the midday-used-to-be-Sunland sun.
- |
  

- Looked like he wanted to pull the door to his guardshack and flip the air on high.
- Finally, I allowed that Davey might be in a group home outside of Sunland by now.
- "\"Maybe he  used  to live here."
- |
  

- Maybe he got better,"
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"It's been years since I've seen him."
- |
  

- He's probably all grown now.
- "\"Well we got plenty of grown ones,\""
- |
  

- Davey Smith would rise and walk, stone rolled from the tomb.
- |
  

- "\"You might try the St."
- |
  

- Vincent DePaul homes across town.
- When I drove off to look for Davey, a flat image settled in the front of my mind.
- |
  

- A gold Tachachalee toy police badge pinned to a big gray cloud on a guard's chest.
- |
  

- Right where aortas should be.
