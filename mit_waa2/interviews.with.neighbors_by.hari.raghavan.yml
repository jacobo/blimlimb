- "SUBJECT: Greta R."
- House next door.
- |
  

- Has two dogs that she inherited when her mother died.
- |
  

- The dogs, which had spent all their lives inside a house doted on by an old woman, now live mostly outside in a small fenced pen.
- |
  

- Greta has a vaguely German or Dutch accent.
- "Q: Hello there."
- "A: Oh, hello."
- "Q: It's gotten pretty cold lately."
- "A: Yes, very chilly last night."
- "Q: Yes it was."
- |
  

- I wonder, don't your dogs get cold in that pen?
- "A: They have the, you know, the little house to go inside when it gets cold."
- "Q: Right."
- |
  

- They were outside most of last night, though.
- "A: Really?"
- "Q: Yes."
- |
  

- Were you outside playing with the dogs?
- |
  

- I could hear them barking a lot.
- "A: Well, I did throw the ball a little, when I fed them."
- "Q: When was that?"
- "A: After dinner."
- |
  

- I think it was about nine o'clock.
- "Q: No, this was around two or two-thirty a.m."
- |
  

- Lots of barking.
- "A: Really?"
- |
  

- I didn't even hear them.
- |
  

- I was asleep.
- "Q: Me too."
- "A: Oh."
- "Q: Until they started barking."
- "A: I'm so, so sorry."
- |
  

- I'm trying to keep them better, but not being at home during the day, and I can't have them inside the house because they scratch&#8230;
- "Q: I looked out the window, and they were just standing around in the pen, barking at nothing in particular."
- "A: Really?"
- |
  

- I'm really sorry.
- |
  

- I'll try&#8230;
- "Q: Do dogs sometimes bark just because they're cold?"
- "A: I don't know&#8230;"
- "Q: Something to think about."

- "SUBJECT: David W."
- Across the hall.
- |
  

- Mail for David W. is frequently put in my mailbox by mistake, mixed in a stack of mail for me.
- "Q: Hello, it's Chris from across the hall."
- "A: Hi."
- "Q: Some of your mail got mixed in with mine again."
- |
  

- Here you go.
- "A: Ah&#8230; thanks."
- |
  

- Our mailman is such a dork.
- "Q: True."
- |
  

- Say, does this ever happen with your mailbox?
- |
  

- I mean, do you ever get any of my mail?
- "A: No. Not that I remember."
- "Q: It just seems like sometimes I miss a bill or a catalog."
- |
  

- Are you sure you don't just get my mail sometimes, then sort of throw it away?
- |
  

- Rather than bother giving it to me?
- |
  

- I mean, how would I ever know, right?
- "A: Oh no, I'd give it to you if I got it."
- "Q: That's funny you should say that, because last week I wrote a letter, addressed it to myself, and put it in your mailbox."
- |
  

- Did you see that one?
- "A: Uh&#8230; no, I don't&#8230; I don't think so&#8230;"
- "Q: Well, if you do find that letter, or if any other mail addressed to me comes to your mailbox, can I ask you to just keep one thing in mind?"
- "A: &#8230;Yes&#8230;"
- "Q: Don't believe everything you read."
- |
  

- "SUBJECT: Will G."
- Upstairs.
- |
  

- Has noisy sex on squeaky bed with squeaky girlfriend.
- "Q: Hey."
- "A: Hey, what's up?"
- "Q: Late night?"
- "A: Yeah, I was working."
- "Q: Ever notice how even though this is a solid old building, how thin the walls and floors are?"
- "A: Oh."
- |
  

- Did I&#8230;
- "Q: No, no."
- |
  

- I mean, sure, I can hear you walking around, but I'm used to it.
- |
  

- Though you do make a lot of stomping noises for such a thin guy.
- "A: I'll try to walk more quietly."
- "Q: I've seen you around lately with that petite little girl, with the fur-fringe coat thing."
- "A: Yeah!"
- |
  

- Denise.
- |
  

- We've been going out for a couple months now.
- "Q: She's cute."
- "A: Yep."
- "Q: I have to tell you this, and please don't take this personally, but before I saw you with her, I just assumed you were gay."
- "A: No way!"
- |
  

- Why?
- "Q: You must really like her."
- "A: Sure, yes I do."
- |
  

- But wait, why did you&#8230;
- "Q: I can hear how much you like her, in fact."
- |
  

- That bed of yours really makes a lot of noise.
- "A: &#8230;"
- "Q: I mean it's a huge racket."
- |
  

- And she, uh, Denise, she's also pretty vocal.
- |
  

- You know?
- "A: I'm&#8230; well, I'm sorry."
- |
  

- I mean, c'mon.
- "Q: Well, the thing is, I'm not sure you can understand just how loud it is down here when you're up there on the bed with her."
- "A: What?"
- "Q: It's not like with a creaking pipe, where I can call you down to listen next time, because if you're down here listening, then obviously, you're not up there making noise."
- "A: Look, sorry, but I really need to&#8230;"
- "Q: So I've made some recordings."
- |
  

- Of the last few sessions.
- "A: You did what?"
- "Q: I promise, you'll be amazed at the volume."
- |
  

- If you hear some distortion on the tape, that's just me breathing.
- |
  

- Now listen.
- |
  

- Listen closely to this part.
- |
  

- This is my favorite.
