  Burial
  So, They finally got me! Who was it? The Government? The Freemasons? The MPAA? I must congratulate Them on a job well done. I am not an easy man to fool. How did I die? Did They poison the stamps I lick? Invent an aluminum-foil-piercing weapon? Switch out the pizza guy for a sexy female assassin who seduced me, then stabbed me with an icepick?

  My fellow members of SHIRT, please take good care of my cat and my mother, if she is still alive. I pray that I was not framed for her murder and killed by the police in a bloody but seemingly justified shootout on Route 8.
