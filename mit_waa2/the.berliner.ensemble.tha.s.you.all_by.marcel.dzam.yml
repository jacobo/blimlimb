- To buy
- The Berliner Ensemble
- Thanks You All ,

- Five years ago, McSweeney's published Marcel Dzama's  The Berlin Years , bringing Dzama's elegant, enigmatic bears, bats, and sexy ladies to a slumbering nation.

- The first edition of that book was snapped up in a matter of minutes, and the same thing happened with a second edition a couple of years later.
- |
  

- "We were thinking about a third printing, but then we thought: instead, why not do it all new and all better?"
- So that's what we've done.
- |
  

- "The format is similar to the original: an envelope with 28 loose-leaf prints good enough to frame, including a hard-to-describe four-way four-parter (four drawings that fit together to make one really large one, wherein any of the four connects to any of the others, and in any configuration: four square, a vertical stack, all horizontal, an L, etc."
- |
  

- Tetris shape); plus a scrapbook; plus an insert card; plus an oversized foldout poster.
- |
  

- "The artwork is entirely new, the scrapbook is new, the envelope has been redesigned\x97it's a whole new thing, in a beloved familiar shape."
- |
  

- "Get one for yourself, one for a friend, and three for your helpless unborn grandchildren\x97they'll thank you someday."
- "Also: Five original Dzama drawings, on hotel stationery, have been sprinkled in randomly."
- |
  

- Sort of like Willy Wonka's golden tickets, except, instead of winning a tour of a dangerous, racist chocolate factory, you get a hot Marcel Dzama original.
- |
  

- Today could be your lucky day.
