  named Jenny.
  1981 According to her official biography, Laetitia (3) is raised between

  discern the germ of the Materialist Conception of History.
  1993 Laetitia (15) is discovered while holidaying at Calvi, Corsica, by a
  scout of the Madison agency. Other sources specify that she was "discovered
  by a photographer while laying on a beach with her family."
