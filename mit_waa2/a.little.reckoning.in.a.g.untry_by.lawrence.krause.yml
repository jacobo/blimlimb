- We are in the small city of Baoding, a hundred kilometres south of Beijing and its bounty of hospitable ATMs that my wife and I took for merry granted in our 36 hours in the capital.

- We have just spent our last two yuan to take a bus to city outskirts, to what we have learned, after an all-day struggle, is the only joint in town we could hope to turn to for replenishment.

- We are exhausted and very hungry, and know no one in this city to whom we might gracefully appeal for a loan.

- While I have always taken private pride in my ever-changing signature, never has its authenticity been questioned.

- Fortunately my wife is a pillar of cool, her signature stagnant, her credit card ready.

- When was the last time my be and seem were one?
- |
  

- I'm my own impersonator.

- I fear &#151; and, like a conflicted criminal yearning for capture, am in part relieved to suspect &#151; that this is only the start of my comeuppance.

- And on virginity not too keen.
- So the House of Wang he calls on
- Finds out that his wife is Olan.
- Appetizing she doesn't find him&#151;
- She always walks ten feet behind him!
- So charming were my friend and I in performance that the teacher didn't notice our copious lyrics covered only the first third of the book.
- My wife, unlike Buck's protagonist, is usually several steps  ahead  of her husband.

- Not only is she taller and possessed of a longer stride and, whenever we walk together, more driven by purpose and less likely to dawdle or snag, her mind (I have only in the last few months of our eight years of marriage come to accept this) is more nimble than mine by several somersaults.

- "On the bus it occurs to me: perhaps it is our culturo-linguistic disparity that has enabled me to fool her all these years into thinking me worthy of her?"
- |
  

- My thought and speech is jam-packed with received witticisms, but after all, if you've grown up never hearing things like "That's a whole other can of beans!
- "\" or \""
- Ask not what you can do for XYZ, but what XYZ can do for you," they can sound pretty clever upon first encounter as an adult.
- |
  

- And I got a million of 'em, enough to fill a book, which I did, of course, full-throttle fraud that I am, and which she loved.

- But what does she know of English prosody?
- |
  

- No more, clearly, than the well-meaning Chinese educators who have hired me as a "visiting scholar." (I am expected to teach American Poetry.
- |
  

- I am not nor have I ever been interested in American Poetry.

- My college degree was no small group effort.

- But she will be teaching what she knows.
- I look down at my passport and wistfully admire the one-of-a-kind signature, more symmetrically florid than most, one of my best.

- "\"You'll lose it,\""

- I hand her the passport and she places it in her bag and zips it safe.

- We are in the back of the bus a la Hoffman & Ross at the end of  The Graduate .
