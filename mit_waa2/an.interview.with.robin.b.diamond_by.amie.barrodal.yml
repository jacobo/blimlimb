- How do you think they're structured?

- |
  

- In the experiment I did, I saw that methane at high pressures is a clear solid, like ice; then when I heated it, it formed solid carbon (diamond), but what didn't make solid diamond (or some other form of carbon) formed liquid.

- I've seen, too, with ammonia and water (though I haven't published this yet), that when I laser heat them I am looking at liquids.
- So really an ocean is the right metaphor.

- They are similar in density, so they should be pretty well mixed, but the lighter one, methane, might be a little more represented at the top of the ocean, while there's more water at the bottom.
- "Q: Is there debris floating in the liquid?"

- Or diamond particles?
- "Bendetti: There are certainly other things mixed into the ocean."

- These experiments that I've done are about hydrocarbons, but I actually expect a whole host of other things.
- |
  

- Some will be liquids, and mostly transparent, but some (like carbon) may be solids.
- |
  

- There will almost be some amount of rocky and metal material there too, but most of the rocky/metal material in Neptune and Uranus may have settled to the bottom to create a core which is differentiated from the ocean.
- |
  

- We cannot tell from observations of the planet whether this has happened.
- |
  

- If it has, there would be some  solid rocky material in the ocean.
- |
  

- If it hasn't, there would be lots of rocky material in the ocean.
- |
  

- I imagine there is at least some core.
- So the picture that I am seeing is really a lot like what you might see if you went to the beach and opened your eyes underwater.

- Mostly but not completely transparent liquid flowing around.

- The other difference is that the densities of everything are higher than the density of water on earth.
- |
  

- "Q: Would it be possible to build some sort of craft that could land on liquid ammonia?"

- Firstly, I'm not sure there will actually be a surface to the  ammonia-water- (and maybe some methane) ocean.
- |
  

- The pressures and temperatures of the hydrogen atmosphere are so high, that the ammonia, water, and methane, and I think even the bottom of the hydrogen are all above the critical point.
- |
  

- What that means is that while there is still gas and liquid, the difference is not going to be obvious, not like the earth's ocean.
- |
  

- So it is possible that as you go down into the planet, it might not have a real distinct surface, where it goes from being in the atmosphere to being in the liquid.

  [Note: Robin Bendetti is a scientist who recreates the thermodynamic
  conditions of planetary interioris using a diamond anvil cell. A diamond
  anvil cell is a machine used to create extremely high pressures.
  When heated with a laser, specimens inside the diamond anvil cell
  reach the temperatures and pressures which approach those of planetary cores
  {10 gigapascals, 2000 Kelvin).
  Neptune and Uranus are composed largely of methane gas.
  Under extremely high pressures and temperatures, methane gas transforms to
  diamond, hydrogen and other hydrocarbons.
  This means the cores of Neptune and Uranus are most likely made of diamond.]

  Q: So what was it you actually saw in the lab?
  Bendetti: What we saw was a transformation from methane to diamond,
  hydrogen, and some other hydrocarbons (with double and triple carbon
  bonds) at pressures above 10 GPa and temperatures around 2000 Kelvin.
  Q: Can you compare 10-50 gigapascals to a pressure we can understand?
  Bendetti: Let's see. 10/50 gigapascals is 100-500 kilobar, which is
  100,000-500,000 atmospheres of pressure. That's not super
  meaningful to me, but it is a start&nbsp;&#151; 1 atmosphere is what you feel
  all the time from the air around you.
  Do you know how when you dive deep in a swimming pool you feel
  pressure in your ears? That's about 0.0004 gigapascals.
  Here's another way. I converted to psi (pounds per square inch). 10
  gigapascals is about 29 million psi. The pressure in a car tire is
  ~30 psi (I think) and in a skinny bicycle tire, it might be as high
  as 100 psi.
  I'm not sure that any of these comparisons really give a sense of
  what a gigapascal feels like. I don't think I know. The way that I
  have any intuition at all is really from watching material in a
  diamond anvil cell
  through a microscope... seeing how the pressure changes materials.
  Water, for example, freezes to ice at room temperature when you give
  it a pressure between .5 and 1 gigapascals.  Coal turns to diamond at
  7
  gigapascals (I think), but you have to also make it hot. Basically,
  these pressures are so high, they don't just make a gas move around,
  they don't just deform shapes, they make the atoms in many solids
  completely
  rearrange themselves at a microscopic level.
  Q: What do you think the planets look like? How do you think they're
  structured?
  Bendetti: Under the conditions inside Neptune, under the hydrogen-and-helium
  atmosphere, I have a mental picture that is much like an ocean, but a
  murky one. In the experiment I did, I saw that methane at high pressures
  is a clear solid, like ice; then when I heated it, it formed solid
  carbon (diamond),
  but what didn't make solid diamond (or some other form of carbon)
  formed liquid. I've seen, too, with ammonia and water (though I haven't
  published this yet), that when I laser heat them I am looking at
  liquids.
  So really an ocean is the right metaphor... picture an ocean of
  methane, ammonia, and water, which are all clear fluids, much like water
  on the earth's surface. They are similar in density, so they should be
  pretty well mixed, but the lighter one, methane, might be a little more
  represented at the top of the ocean, while there's more water at the
  bottom.
  Q: Is there debris floating in the liquid? Or diamond particles?
  Bendetti: There are certainly other things mixed into the ocean. These
  experiments that I've done are about hydrocarbons, but I actually
  expect a whole host of other things. Some will be liquids, and mostly
  transparent, but some (like carbon) may be solids. There will almost
  be some amount of rocky and metal material there too, but most of the
  rocky/metal material in Neptune and Uranus
  may have settled to the bottom to create a core which is differentiated
  from the ocean. We cannot tell from observations of the planet whether
  this has happened. If it has, there would be some  solid
  rocky material in the ocean. If it hasn't, there would be lots of rocky
  material in the ocean. I imagine there
  is at least some core.
  So the picture that I am seeing is really a lot like what you might see if
  you went to the beach and opened your eyes underwater. Mostly but not
  completely transparent liquid flowing around... with a lot of suspended
  particles (like sand)... which over short times flow with the water, but
  over long times settle to the bottom of the ocean.
  The other difference is that the densities of everything are higher than
  the density of water on earth.... more than twice as dense... but still
  not really as dense as rock... but because it's so hot the dynamics may
  not be that different.
  Q: Would it be possible to build some sort of craft that could land on
  liquid ammonia?
  Bendetti: I'm going to try to start with facts for this one and work up to
  an
  intelligent answer.
  Firstly, I'm not sure there will actually be a surface to the 
  ammonia-water- (and maybe some methane) ocean. The pressures and temperatures of
  the hydrogen atmosphere are so high, that the ammonia, water, and methane,
  and I think even the bottom of the hydrogen are all above the critical
  point. What that means is that while there is still gas and liquid, the
  difference is not going to be obvious, not like the earth's ocean. So it
  is possible that as you go down into the planet, it might not have a real
  distinct surface, where it goes from being in the atmosphere to being in
  the liquid. I don't really know just how to describe what it will be like,
  it will just get denser and denser, but I don't have a very good physical
  
  picture of that process myself.
  Q: Perhaps some sort of foam base would solve our problem...
  Bendetti: Maybe the right understanding to take away from my experiments is
  not "Neptune is a huge hunk of diamond" but something closer to "giant
  planets likely have diamond in them, possibly a lot of it, but they are
  also extraordinarily complex inside, with the actual materials subject to
  a lot of physics and chemistry."
  Q: You know who we should ask? NASA.
