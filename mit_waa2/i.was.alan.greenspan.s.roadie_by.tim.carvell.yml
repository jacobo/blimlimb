- "\"Hello, Detroit!"
- Technically, it was the Palace of Auburn Hills, but no one corrected him.
- |
  

- No one ever did.
- |
  

- For he was Alan Greenspan, he was on tour, and 22,000 eager fans had paid up to $125 apiece to see him, not including the Ticketmaster surcharge.
- |
  

- They roared their approval as one.
- |
  

- They'd been patient through the opening acts -- Alice Rivlin and her trained dogs, Kid Rock, Cokie Roberts' amusing anecdotes from This Week (her David Brinkley impersonation was uncanny) -- but now, the place just went fucking nuts.
- "Alan let them go on a little while, then finally spoke: \"I hope there isn't any irrational exuberance going on!"
- "\" That, of course, just set them off again."
- |
  

- Looking closely at Alan from the wings, I could see him slump a little.
- |
  

- It was clear that, ten cities into a twelve-city tour, the grind was getting to be a bit much.
- |
  

- "What's more, this wasn't even the tour he'd envisioned: He'd wanted to devote this one to acoustic performances, in smaller venues."
- |
  

- But the promoters had come to him and patiently explained that he could make much, much more money with another swing through the big showplaces.
- |
  

- They calculated the work-to- revenue ratios for everyone involved; they showed him bar graphs that tallied up the difference.
- |
  

- "The promoters knew their man: Alan had always been a sucker for bar graphs."
- |
  

- He sighed, smiled wanly, and announced that he'd do the arena tour.
- |
  

- "\"It seems like the more prudent course,\""
- |
  

- Prudent it may have been, but at this point, I couldn't help but wonder if it had been worth it.
- |
  

- "Not that I had much time to ponder the question: I had to set off the flash pots."
- |
  

- They went off, and while the audience was distracted by the light and smoke, the other roadies quickly lifted the scrim that had hidden the conference-room set; it was all done so seamlessly that it looked like the set had materialized out of thin air.
- "It's funny: The conference-room scene was more or less the same as it had been during the past three tours, but the crowd still loved it."
- |
  

- Essentially, it consisted of the Fed governors trying to persuade Alan to raise rates, and him gallantly fighting them off.
- |
  

- The governors took turns being the heavy in this scene, so as not to prejudice the public against any one of them.
- |
  

- We learned our lesson on the '97 Tour, when Ed Kelley played the bad guy, night after night; by the end of it, his family was receiving death threats.
- |
  

- Tonight, it was Ed Gramlich's turn; Gramlich was always my favorite, the most natural actor of the bunch.
- |
  

- "\"Mr. Greenspan,\""
- |
  

- "\"we simply cannot afford to play dice with the nation's economy."
- "\"Well, Ed,\""
- |
  

- Greenspan replied, "I've always been a bit of a riverboat gambler.
- It wasn't even an especially snappy comeback, but the audience always roared at the line.
- |
  

- "Then they started the chanting, sort of a low rumble, sounding like an enormous collective \x91Moo."
- |
  

- "Obviously, they were trying to replicate  the \x91Bruuuuuuuce' familiar to Springsteen concertgoers, but it was apparent that the crowd was split between \x91Aaaaaalllaaaaaaan' and \x91Greeeeeeeeenspaaaaaaaan,' with a few diehards going with \x91Buuuuuuuuuck,' Greenspan's lesser-known Phi Psi nickname."
- |
  

- Anyway, the diverging chants blended together and didn't make much sense, but it was the spirit of it that mattered, I supposed.
- "Surveying the crowd, I could see that it was much the same as always: A thick clot of pinstriped bankers and fund managers near the stage, and, in the distance, individual investors in the cheaper seats."
- |
  

- I once pointed out to Alan that it seemed unfair that the small investors, who'd been responsible for much of his popularity, weren't closer to the stage; I even suggested that we bring a couple of folks from the nosebleed sections and put them in the front row, the way Springsteen does.
- |
  

- He fixed me with that stern but patient look of his and said, "It's a free market economy.
- "\" I felt like a fool."
- The rest of the evening went according to plan -- the conference room scene giving way to a set consisting of a table and a glass of water, as Greenspan defended his policies to the Joint Economic Committee.
- |
  

- When he got to the big money line -- "Betting against markets is usually precarious, at best"-- a few fund managers threw their underpants onto the stage. The underpants-tossing had begun as a joke a few years back, at a show in Dallas, but it had now become a nightly ritual, one that always discomfited Alan. Then came the medley of Alan's best- known speeches, with the other governors each getting a solo of their own finest moments.
- Then Alan announced that he was going to "slow things down a bit," pulled out his guitar, and began the four-song set that he'd insisted he be allowed to do every night; tonight, he did "Kentucky Rain," "Always on My Mind," "Daydream Believer," and -- a surprise fourth choice -- Warren Zevon's "Accidentally Like a Martyr.
- "\" The crowd got restless during the singing -- they always did -- but I sensed that it was the one part of the show that Alan actually looked forward to, and he didn't really give a rat's ass whether the crowd enjoyed it or not."
- |
  

- That was Alan.
- After that, there came a bit of padding -- a performance from Cirque du Soleil, with Alan giving some witty patter about how this acrobat represents interest rates, while that one represents housing starts, etc -- and then the big finale, when Alan took questions from the audience.
- |
  

- The first question, as always, was "So, are you going to raise rates?
- "\", to which Alan gave the exact same answer he always did: \""
- Yes.
- "\" (Pause, wait for gasp."
- |
  

- "\"Oh, I'm sorry, did you ask about raising rates?"
- |
  

- I thought you asked if I like Yeats.
- "\" Again, not a great line, but the audience howled."
- Then came the usual three or four or five additional attempts to weasel the information  out of him -- "Should I be buying stocks right now?
- "\"; \""
- What would you invest in these days, cyclical or non-cyclical stocks?
- "\" and so on, followed by a few softballs on the Latin American  economy and, this time, a Detroit- specific question about the auto industry."
- |
  

- Then, as always, they started asking the weird stuff -- "
- What do you eat for breakfast?
- "\" ; \""
- How's Andrea doing?
- "\"; \""
- Can I kiss you?
- "\" -- before Alan finally thanked them for their time and waved good night."
- |
  

- After standing in the wings for about two minutes of applause, he straightened his jacket, smoothed down his tie, and came back for the encore -- where he did the usual, a magic trick in which he appeared to levitate his "
- |
  

- "\" special guest Robert Rubin."
- Then, finally, Alan was hustled out the back door before the applause even ended.
- |
  

- The crowd milled around for a little while, hoping he'd come back  for another encore, or maybe they'd catch a glimpse of him grabbing a favorite towel off the stage.
- |
  

- "And then, the part of the job I liked the best: I cleared my throat, picked up the microphone and spoke into the P.A."
- |
  

- "\"Ladies and gentleman,\""
- |
  

- I announced.
- |
  

- "\"The Fed chairman has left the building."
- Not very original, I realize, but Alan liked sticking to the script, and who was I to argue?
- |
  

- I was a mere roadie, and I would have followed him anywhere.
