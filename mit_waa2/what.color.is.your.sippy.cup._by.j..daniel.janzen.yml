  Applying to pre-kindergarten is in essence a journey of self-discovery. Think of your future as a diaper full of potential that's just waiting to be explored. Once you get it open, who knows what you might find ... maybe even a lifetime of success and happiness! You may be only 23 months old, but your fate is in your sticky, jam-smeared hands&#8212;so be sure not to fumble it. There's only so much room at the top of the play structure nowadays, and it's a long way down to the damp, dirty sand below.
  An effective application strategy begins with a solid understanding of your strengths and weaknesses as a candidate. It's important to show potential in specific, clearly recognizable areas; generalists tend to get lost in the crowd. At the same time, you've got to project a total package that stands out from every other nice smile and skinned knee she sees today. To inventory your aptitude, ask yourself these four questions:
  1. What is your skill set? Are you better at digging holes or nesting Tupperware? How many blocks can you stack&#8212;or do you prefer trying to fit them all in your mouth instead? Can you handle a fork and spoon, or is everything still finger food? (If you're still getting the booby, please see the companion volume  The Other Side of the Playground: Coping with Homeschooling .)
  2. How smart are you? Do you still scream in terror when someone has "got your nose"? Does that four-piece puzzle have you flapping your hands in frustration and reaching for your binky? If you're already on the slow track, you should gear your expectations to a less demanding career, like photographer's assistant, pigeon feeder, or playground loiterer.
  3. How's your rhythm? Do you get music at all, or is it just a bunch of noise and clapping? The ability to carry a tune can be your ticket to gifted programs for years to come. On the other hand, tone-deaf caterwauling might land you in the wrong kind of special school, fitted with a highly unflattering helmet. If you're not sure, it's best to err on the side of restraint.
  4. When you go places on an airplane, does the extra mommy who changes your diapers instead of your real mommy go with you?
