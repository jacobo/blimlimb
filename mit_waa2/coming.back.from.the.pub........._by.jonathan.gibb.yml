  . . . we wobbled and raced our bikes along the raised
  roadway that wound its route through the absolute dark of the Fens, dangerously
  lined on either verge by barely visible trees, following
  the one or two faint torch beams held by those at the front
  of the group.
  . . . we lay ourselves down spread-eagled on our backs on
  Nine Ashes Road, where it dipped across the fields
  towards the sunken village &#151; a dare to the traffic, or to the
  cold surveillance of the million stars.
  . . . we came suddenly upon the breathtaking view of
  Manchester, dot-to-dotted in a million points of light below
  our camping site on the moortop &#151; where all, prior to
  nightfall, had been invisible, whether in cloud, mist or
  distance I could not say.
  . . . I failed over the short distance from the door to her
  driveway &#151; on my first evening out with the old friends after
  being abroad for six months &#151; to engineer a moment alone
  with her, and was told, later on the walk home, that she
  had thought my letter was awful, arrogant and pretentious,
  and wouldn't see me again.
  . . . I posted a still-lit cigarette stub into a red pillar box, and
  was surprised to find my companions appalled, not thrilled,
  by my depravity.
  . . . we bought two kebabs a-piece, one for now, one for
  halfway home, but I ate mine both straight away, in an
  sickening feat of gluttony.
  . . . I rapped my furled umbrella (the first full-sized model I
  had ever possessed) on the lamp posts of
  Clermont-Ferrand as I passed, in homage to Gene Kelly,
  and ruined it in the process.
  . . . I was fine, straining to preserve absolute stillness but
  fine, on the bus, but threw up dramatically, efficiently, into
  the pavement excavation at the corner of our street.
  . . . she was fine, standing and swaying in polite
  conversation but fine, on the bus, and considered a while
  on the sofa before agreeing to share my bed with me for
  the night.
  . . . I bought a porn magazine in a 7-11, which, chosen in
  haste, and turning out to be quite devoid of beauty or taste
  to sugar its basic pleasures, got one use before being put &#151;
  not self-disgustedly, but just . . .  disgustedly  &#151;
  straight into the flat bins the next morning.
