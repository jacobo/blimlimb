- In November, McSweeney's will publish  The Middle Stories , a collection of tales of various lengths by noted Canadian author Sheila Heti.
- |
  

- At the same time, Sheila will  tour  in support of her book hand-in-hand with the first Stateside appearance of the  Trampoline Hall Tour .
- |
  

- During this week, we will present to you some stories, interviews and testimonials concerning Sheila Heti,  The Middle Stories , and Trampoline Hall.
- |
  

- Read  day one .

- "Q: You say your drawings don't often come out the way you intended?"
- "Heti: That's true."
- |
  

- I love to draw, but I do not often draw looking at the page.
- |
  

- I like it to be a surprise, what the outcome is, and I like to see if I can intuit where a line &#151; like the line of the mouth or the
- |
  

- The same thing with my stories.
- |
  

- When I was writing the stories that ended up in  The Middle Stories  I often would write faster than I could keep up in my mind, so that I could not see more than one or two sentences ahead.
- "Q: How did you fall into it?"
- "Heti: Because at first I was writing plays."
- |
  

- I didn't know what to do with myself so I decided to apply to the National Theatre School in Montreal.
- |
  

- I felt like it would be enjoyable to put together an application.
- |
  

- There was a bar near the school where one could buy pot with one's bank card.
- |
  

- That's Montreal.
- |
  

- In any case, it was a fine year until they refused to put on my play, an adaptation of Faust, which I had been working on all year with a fourth-year director.
- |
  

- And we had a workshop production, and were about to go into rehearsals, and the actors had been hired and everything and our teachers came, and they just hated it.
- |
  

- They hated it so much.
- |
  

- I remember sitting there with the director and I just had chills all over me, I thought it was so fantastic.
- |
  

- It was shut down.
- |
  

- After that happened I left the school and soon after I started writing stories.
- "Q: What do you talk about?"
- "Heti: I haven't been having very good conversations lately."
- |
  

- Sometimes you forget how to have them.
- |
  

- I was much better at them when I had a job.
- |
  

- That keeps you in practise.
- |
  

- Lately the only people I've been talking to, besides my family, are Misha and Carl, and often it is only about organizing the tour.
- |
  

- And I forget what other people say to each other, what I have said to people.
- |
  

- I forget how one gets into an intimate conversation.
- |
  

- I asked a friend at a party the other night, "Are you pleased?
- "\" \""
- Pleased about what?
- "\" he answered."
- |
  

- I thought it would get us into an intimate conversation, but it didn't.
- |
  

- We ended up talking about the skyline in Singapore.
- "Q: Do you see a difference between the social roles of Canadian and American writers?"
- "Heti: I don't know what it's like to be an American writer, but to be a writer in Canada right now &#151; I can't think of anything I'd like more."
- |
  

- There seems to be no sense of boundaries, either in what can be written, or in terms of what kind of readership a person can have, here and abroad.
- |
  

- And so the atmosphere is very festive.
- |
  

- People go out together a lot.
- |
  

- There's a sense of prosperity, no end to the party.
- |
  

- And it's not so terribly huge a group, so you get the language poets going to readings with the lyrical poets and that is good for the literature; that people aren't cloistered away in their little insular groups.
- |
  

- I think it must be a bit confusing to be an American writer because of the wealthy entertainment industry, and the jacked-up buzz of film and television and magazines, so that I wonder if it doesn't sometimes become dismaying for a writer to witness their books becoming part of the gross daily output; that there perhaps isn't a different place in the culture for literature.
- |
  

- Perhaps some people like that.
- |
  

- But I like how it feels in Canada, where our literature has a special place because it's one of the only things we feel nationalistic about, and it's not equated with television, it's not part of the same industry at all.
- "Q: Are you interested in the other arts at all?"
- |
  

- In painting, sculpture, music, opera, dance?
- "Heti: Painting very much."
- |
  

- I dislike all forms of journalism and having to do any kind of writing except fiction and plays and writing about art.
- |
  

- Writing about art is no different from thinking about art, whereas writing essays, writing journalism, is much more about laying something out for someone, which strikes me as very tedious.
- |
  

- I learn more from artists, and I get more inspired looking at art, than from books and reading.
- |
  

- Reading great books doesn't inspire me.
- |
  

- It is its own thing.
- |
  

- It feels disconnected from writing.
- |
  

- Whereas how a painter might approach a subject always gives me lots of ideas for how I might write.
- "Q: What is the greatest essential of a story?"
- "Heti: Every good story names something."
- |
  

- In the way that other languages have words for feelings or experiences for which we don't have equivalent words, a story should be like that word in another language for a feeling or an experience we don't yet have the name for.
- "Q: So you don't have a reader in mind when you sit down and compose?"
- "Heti: If ever a reader comes into my head I feel deflated and that is when I lose track."
- |
  

- Sometimes I can get back on, but sometimes I just put an end to the story.
- |
  

- Thinking of a reader is the equivalent, for me, of imagining someone picking it apart.
- |
  

- That's not helpful, but it is more difficult now than it used to be to shut such thoughts out.
- |
  

- I imagine I'm going to have to find a way around this problem, the problem of the reader cropping up.
- |
  

- I'm not going to be very successful, I don't think, at forcing myself not to think it.
- |
  

- So I had better find of way of making it a good thing, when a reader comes into my mind.
- |
  

- But I never picture a rapt reader, just one wrinkling his nose.
- "Q: You were an infantry battalion scout in the war?"
- "Heti: No."
- "Q: Back to the critics again?"
- "Heti: I used to think that I would read reviews and get all sorts of insights into my work, but that only happens if the critic is confused, and is asking questions, like in one review a man wrote: \"When the plumber discovers that a plague is causing the princess to `shrivel away,' he immediately suspects a frog who had lectured him the previous day on how to win the affection of the princess."
- |
  

- But why does he finger his adviser?
- "\" Perhaps it is juvenile but my boyfriend and I laughed about that for hours."
- |
  

- When a critic seems to know what's going on, or thinks he knows what's going on, there's little use in it for me.
- |
  

- Also, I think there's a difference between being a critic and a reviewer, and most of what we have here are reviewers, and often it is other writers, and that gets a little complicated and is also rarely interesting.
- |
  

- I always try my best not to write book reviews because I think it is suffocating for a writer to have to think about books in that way.
- |
  

- Sometimes I need the money, but usually, thankfully, there are other things I can do besides review books.
- "Q: Are you afraid you're going to die on your road trip?"
- "Heti: Only a bit."
