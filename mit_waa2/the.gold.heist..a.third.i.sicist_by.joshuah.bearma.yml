- Joshuah Bearman's father, a nuclear physicist, has worked for most of his professional life at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
- |
  

- He lives in Pasadena.
- |
  

- "Joshuah's first interview with his father appeared in McSweeney's #4, and the second, dealing with the possibility of life on Mars, appeared in McSweeney's #5."
- |
  

- Last December, four men posing as military officials and JPL scientists falsely requisitioned $1.

- "\"experiments."
- "\" They put a sign on the door of a small, dingy, recently rented office across from a storage yard in east Pasadena, labeled it  JPL NEUTRON ACCELERATOR PROJECT , called Stern-Leach, a large  precious metals processor, and ordered substantive quantities of gold sheets and wiring."
- |
  

- The one who made the call said he was Sergeant Michael Jeffries, from the Department of Defense, and that they needed a rush job on their gold delivery, as it was "
- |
  

- "\"  The plot was thwarted, not least of all because when the heisters' purchase order came in soon after the initial call, \""
- |
  

- "\" was misspelled twice."
- |
  

- Stern-Leach contacted federal authorities, and the four men, believing their plan unspoiled, arranged the delivery over the next couple weeks.
- |
  

- Among other curious details, the name they specified as the receiver of the gold shipment was Charles Schultz.
- |
  

- Dr. Charles Schultz.
- |
  

- The gold came, the men were arrested, and as the story of the scam spread, other precious-metals firms realized they may have fallen for this same scam in the past year.
- "ME: Now, tell me about the gold heist."
- "DAD: It wasn't actually a gold heist."
- "ME: So tell me about the gold caper."
- "DAD: It wasn't a caper either."
- "ME: What was it?"
- "DAD: It was a scam."
- |
  

- A pretty good one too, in theory.
- "ME: Why was it a pretty good scam, in theory?"
- "DAD: Because we do use gold a lot at the lab."
- "ME: And how did you get involved?"
- "DAD: Well, I don't know anything about the scam&#151;"
- "ME: But you were at the JPL hospitality desk when the press called."
- "DAD: Not the hospitality desk."
- |
  

- We don't have a hospitality desk, and I wouldn't be there if we did.
- |
  

- I walked into the public affairs office, or the public education office&#151;I actually don't know what they call it anymore.
- |
  

- But I went in there because a friend of mine had gotten some photos for our nex t door neighbor's son&#151;I was going to give them to him for Christmas&#151;and the woman in there was on the phone, talking to a reporter, and she asks me, "what do you know about gold at JPL?
- "\" And I say, \""
- We use it for thermal control and electrical contacts.
- "\" So she says, \""
- "Here: talk to this guy\" and she hands me the phone."
- "ME: So these guys, the scammers, they pretended to be scientists and ordered gold."
- |
  

- And they'd done this before successfully, apparently, so there is some believability to the story, right?
- "DAD: Sure."
- "ME: How is gold used in science?"
- "DAD: Gold is used in electronics, among other things."
- |
  

- You often have gold plated contacts.
- |
  

- Gold doesn't oxidize; it doesn't tarnish.
- |
  

- When a contact is made from a material that tarnishes, it gets oxidizing layers on it, and those layers don't conduct as well as regular metal, so you get ground loops and you get conductive resistances&#151;various hindrances&#151;and you don't want that.
- |
  

- So people like to use gold.
- |
  

- We use gold on spacecraft for just that reason.
- "ME: Is gold the best material for that then?"
- "DAD: Yeah."
- |
  

- Gold is really primo.
- |
  

- No tarnish.
- |
  

- Did you ever have to shine gold?
- "ME: But why do you have to buy gold when you can make as much of it as you want from lead?"
- |
  

- Isn't that all you're doing in there anyway?
- "DAD: Yeah, right."
- |
  

- In the Philosopher's Stone department?
- |
  

- Transmutation doesn't get much funding.
- "ME: But you can actually make gold out of lead these days."
- "DAD: Well, yes, technically transmutation is possible."
- |
  

- It's just not very practical.
- |
  

- It costs far more to make gold out of lead than it does to just go out and buy gold&#151;and the difference would be in the billions of dollars if you're talking about a lot of gold.
- "ME: How do you make gold out of lead exactly?"
- "DAD: Oh, you just."
- |
  

- I don't know exactly, I'd have to look in my&#151;
- "ME: Book of incantations."
- "DAD: No, no, no."
- |
  

- In the periodic table.
- |
  

- You would fire neutrons at it, break it up, do a little something&#151;and then you'd get a little beta decay, change a neutron into a proton, or something like that and&#151;wsssht!
- |
  

- "ME: How big does your cauldron have to be?"
- "DAD: No cauldron."
- "ME: Anyone at JPL with the title \"Abstractor of the Quintessence?"
- "DAD: No."
- "ME: Quintessence is no longer part of the scientific discourse, then."
- "DAD: Actually, they're starting to talk about quintessence again in cosmology, I think."
- "ME: Really?"
- |
  

- How so?
- "DAD: I'm not a cosmologist, so I can't really say."
- "ME: Let's get back to the heist for a second."
- |
  

- These guys were buying raw gold, but you don't really do that at JPL.
- |
  

- Was that the tip-off?
- "DAD: No, that's not right really."
- |
  

- Mostly we buy scientific instruments with gold in them.
- |
  

- But we also buy just gold.
- |
  

- Gold sheets.
- |
  

- Gold foil.
- |
  

- Gold wiring.
- |
  

- Gold wire is used for doing chip bonding; foil can be&#151;
- "ME: Chip bonding?"
- "DAD: If you have an experimental chip of some sort that you've made and you want to bond out the electrical contacts, you use gold wire for that."
- |
  

- But we don't buy gold bars.
- |
  

- That we don't need.
- "ME: Is the gold foil the same kind of thing used in filigree?"
- "DAD: No, no."
- |
  

- Oh.
- |
  

- Yes, yes.
- |
  

- Sorry, I was thinking of teeth.
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- The foil is like what they use for filigree&#151;What is that sound?
- "ME: That's this thing."
- |
  

- My laptop.
- "DAD: Oh yeah."
- |
  

- I kept hearing this fan noise, and looking around for it, but it's right here.
- "ME: Yeah."
- |
  

- There's a fan in here.
- "DAD: Yup."
- "ME: Don't worry about it too much."
- |
  

- You have these things at JPL, right?
- |
  

- These computer gizmos?
- "DAD: Yes we do."
- "ME: Gold is also a good reflector."
- "DAD: Yes."
- |
  

- We use gold with thermal control.
- |
  

- One of the biggest problems with spacecraft is that they get too hot or too cold.
- |
  

- And if you've ever seen pictures of spacecraft, you'll notice that they always have these shiny gold blankets on them.
- |
  

- Those are called thermal blankets.
- |
  

- And when their reflective surface is gold they have a low emmisivity, which means it doesn't emit much IR radiation.
- |
  

- In other words, it doesn't emit much heat, so it preserves warmth.
- |
  

- But at the same time, gold has a high reflectivity, so it reflects the sun and keeps the spacecraft from getting too hot.
- |
  

- This is important on a spacecraft, because there's no other heat sink to control temperature.
- |
  

- You have to figure out a way to radiate the heat out into space.
- |
  

- So that's thermal control in a nutshell.
- "ME: Now, the robbers, or scammers rather, claimed in their requisition letter was that the gold was for a project called the JPL Neutron Accelerator."
- "DAD: Yeah, that would have been a big tip-off, since there's no such thing."
- "ME: And moreover, they said they needed the gold foil right away because the project was for \"the shuttle."
- "DAD: Did they say that?"
- "ME: I think so."
- "DAD: That's cockamamie."
- "ME: And the delivery was supposed to go to Charles Schultz."
- "DAD: What morons."
- "ME: And their letter to the Stern-Leach misspelled the word \"sergeant."
- "DAD: Well, that's pretty stupid too."
- |
  

- Even if they spelled it correctly, we're not a military installation.
- |
  

- Haven't been since 1958, when NASA was formed.
- "ME: So you don't have sergeants?"
- "DAD: No, no."
- |
  

- Of course not.
- "ME: And you don't have a neutron accelerator at JPL?"
- "DAD: No: it's not even possible."
- |
  

- And everyone around the lab gets a laugh when they hear about that one.
- |
  

- "\"Oh yeah, let me just check on my neutron accelerator."
- "\" Stupid."
- "ME: Why is it not possible?"
- |
  

- No charge?
- "DAD: Right."
- |
  

- You can't accelerate neutrons.
- |
  

- Hello?
- |
  

- Particle accelerators work by moving charged particles in an electromagnetic field.
- |
  

- And neutrons have no charge.
- |
  

- "Hence the name: neutron."
- |
  

- As in neutral particle.
- "ME: So you wouldn't get much acceleration there."
- "DAD: You wouldn't get any."
- "ME: But you could theoretically move neutrons around, right?"
- "DAD: You can manipulate neutrons because they have a quadropole moment."
- |
  

- You could steer them with that, I think, but not accelerate them.
- "ME: Quadropole moment?"
- |
  

- What's that?
- |
  

- Particles have moment?
- |
  

- Sounds .
- |
  

- "DAD: Oh jeez."
- |
  

- I don't know how to explain that.
- |
  

- "DAD: hmm."
- "ME: The ineffable moment."
- |
  

- "DAD: I don't know how to explain moment."
- |
  

- I know what it means, but you need to know all kinds of&#151;
- "ME: We don't have to get too into the moment."
- "DAD: Well, suppose you take an assembly of charges."
- |
  

- And you can describe the field at any one point as linear combinations of the fields from other electrical charges&#151;suppose you have a half a dozen of them arranged in some pattern.
- |
  

- Then you look at the field from some distance away.
- |
  

- It's the linear combination of all the individual fields.
- |
  

- And then you ask, "how do I describe this thing?
- "\" Well, as you get further and further away from this set of charges, they tend to look more and more like a single charge with a bunch of properties."
- |
  

- And that set of properties is written out in expansions called moments.
- |
  

- There's a dipole moment, a quadropole moment, an octopole moment, and so on.
- |
  

- And whether you have these properties depends on the assembly of charges, whether there's symmetry or a certain type of arrangement.
- |
  

- And the same thing is true for magnetics.
- |
  

- There's magnetic dipoles and so on.
- "ME: I don't know about all that, but what's it like walking around with all that stuff in your head?"
- |
  

- Do you feel different having so much detail about the physical world available to you?
- "DAD: No. Only every so often when people say really stupid things about science do I realize that I'm different, if that's the way to put it."
- |
  

- But most of the people I deal with every day are scientists, or least engineers and technicians, and in that environment there is no difference.
- |
  

- We all speak the same language.
- |
  

- And that's why we all giggle when we hear about the "special gold delivery" for the JPL Neutron Accelerator.
- "ME: Well, I'm out of questions and tape, so I guess that's it."
- |
  

- Thanks a lot.
- "DAD: No problem."
- |
  

- Are you staying for dinner?
- "ME: What's on?"
- "DAD: Kasha."
- "ME: OK."
- "DAD: Then clear this stuff out and set the table."

  Last December, four men posing as military officials and JPL scientists falsely requisitioned $1.6 million in gold for their "experiments."
