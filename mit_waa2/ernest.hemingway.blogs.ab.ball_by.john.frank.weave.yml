  UCLA Bruins
  Southern Californians leave me divided. Men like John Wayne epitomize everything that is right with masculinity. Men like Pauly Shore epitomize men castrated like dogs. I don't know how I feel about the UCLA Bruins. They have many unknowns, such as freshman center Kevin Love. He averages a bull-like double-double.

  Memphis Tigers
  John Calipari is a smooth man. His hair is a product of his slickness. It is well coifed. He wants to sell something to everyone. He has sold basketball in a city of music. Heroes who dunk have replaced heroes who jam. But men remain men. And men push back against what challenges them. The Memphis players have pushed back against Conference USA. All the other teams in Conference USA have fallen before the macho force of the Memphis men. The guards are fast. They race up the court like angry, hung-over tigers. The front court is powerful.

He dares opposing players to mount him and score. I believe in big men. I also believe in the power of blood. Junior forward Patrick Ewing Jr. is his father reincarnated. John Thompson III harnesses the manly terror that his father used on the sidelines. These men are gifted. These men are winners. These men will be the champions.
