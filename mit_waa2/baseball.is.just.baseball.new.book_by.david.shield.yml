- I agonized all spring about whether to get cable TV.

- "I didn't want my eight-year-old daughter, Natalie, to get hooked on the Cartoon Network, but I wanted to watch the Mariners, who were off to a brilliant start&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;not just winning the overwhelming majority of their games, but playing a new (for them), beautiful brand of team baseball: sacrifice bunts rather than three-run homers."
- |
  

- I went so far as to call the cable company to get estimates for packages.
- |
  

- Twice I scheduled appointments for installation, only to cancel both times.
- A week and a half into the season, I was listening to the A's-Mariners game on the radio.
- |
  

- After a few innings, I couldn't stand it any longer, and though I don't drink, I ran around the corner to a sports bar.
- |
  

- Oakland's Terrence Long was on first base.
- |
  

- The next batter singled to right field, and when Long tried to run from first to third base (a relatively routine maneuver), the Mariners' right-fielder, Ichiro Suzuki&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;the first Japanese position-player in the major leagues and who, like Madonna or Cher or Pel&eacute;, goes only by his first name&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;threw the ball on a low line-drive from medium-deep right field all the way to the third baseman who easily tagged Long out.
- The bar erupted, the announcer went berserk, I felt that weird tingle down my spine I get about twice a decade, and for the next twenty-four hours all anyone could talk about&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;on the post-game show, on the pre-game show the next day, on sports-talk radio&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;was "The Throw.
- "\" Several players, coaches, and broadcasters said it was the single greatest throw they'd ever seen."
- "\"The ball came out of a cannon; it was quick and powerful."
- "\"It was like Ichiro threw a coin to third base."
- "\"He threw a laser."
- "\"It was like something out of Star Wars."
- Even Terrence Long said, "It was going to take a perfect throw to get me, and it was a perfect throw.
- Asked to explain, Ichiro said, "The ball was hit right to me.
- |
  

- Why did he run when I was going to throw him out?
- Cable was installed by the end of the week.
- |
  

- Day after day a similar scenario would play out on the diamond.
- |
  

- Ichiro would perform some Herculean feat on the field&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;an amazing throw or catch or steal or hit&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and then afterward, asked about it, he'd say something that was.
- |
  

- He'd dismiss it or deny it or demur or empty out the premise or give credit elsewhere.
- |
  

- Now that I had cable, I decided to supplement my subscription to the  Seattle Times  with a subscription to the  Seattle Post-Intelligencer .
- |
  

- I couldn't wait to get up every morning and, while I ate my breakfast and made Natalie's lunch (and while she watched the Cartoon Network), read what Ichiro said about what he'd done the night before.
- |
  

- He never boasted in the way I was accustomed to athletes doing, or if he did, he seemed to do so in a way that was fresh and funny in its uncluttered assertion of neutral fact.
- Was I making too much of this?
- |
  

- Was I trying to impart philosophic significance to simple athletic excellence, as I'm prone to do?
- |
  

- Maybe the words acquired a lyrical glamour as they got translated from Japanese to English?
- |
  

- Perhaps it was the translators themselves who were turning Ichiro's ordinary statements into haunting aphorisms?
- |
  

- Maybe it was a cultural-transmission issue?
- |
  

- Maybe what were to my Western ears Zen koans were, to Ichiro, self-evident truths, the only gestures available?
- |
  

- I could analyze it to death, but I'd rather not.
- |
  

- As he does after every game, Ichiro rubbed a six-inch wooden stick up and down the sides and bottoms of his feet, massaging the pressure points.
- |
  

- Asked the name of the device he was using, he said, "Wood.
- |
  

- In a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Ichiro made two spectacular diving catches.
- |
  

- Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said, "The catch he made on Anderson's ball down the line and the catch he made on Hairston's ball&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;no other right fielder in the American League makes those plays.
- |
  

- Maybe he makes one of them but doesn't make both of them.
- "\" Asked, afterward, which of the catches was the most difficult, Ichiro said, \""
- It's tough to say which one was the toughest, because each fly ball had a different characteristic.
- |
  

- Ichiro reached high above the wall, caught what otherwise would have been a home run, fell to the ground, did a backwards somersault, adjusted his sunglasses, and then slowly pulled the ball out from under his glove to show that he had caught it.
- |
  

- Asked to analyze the play, he said, "It was a fly ball; I caught it.
- |
  

- During a game between the Mariners and A's in Oakland, fans in the right-field bleachers taunted him with racial epithets and threw quarters and ice at him.
- |
  

- A man who hit Ichiro in the head with a quarter stood and took a bow.
- |
  

- Afterward, asked what happened, Ichiro said&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;according to the translator, Ted Heid&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;"Something came out of the stands and hit me.
- "\" Ichiro immediately said something to Heid, who said, \""
- I must correct my previous interpretation.
- |
  

- Ichiro said, 'Something came out of the sky and hit me.
- |
  

- "\" Asked how much money he collected, Ichiro said, \""
- I couldn't tell if it was rain or money coming down.
- "\" Asked if something like this had ever happened to him in Japan, he said, \""
- Of course it happened there.
- |
  

- Anytime you come in as a visiting team, things fall out of the sky.
- |
  

- The gods once threw an aluminum can at me.
- |
  

- Asked his reaction to Alex Rodriguez getting booed so vociferously upon his return to Seattle, Ichiro said, "It's very tough for a ballplayer to get proud and keep his dignity.
- |
  

- There's not much difference between love and hate.
- |
  

- Asked whether he thought he'd have trouble making the adjustment to the major leagues, Ichiro said, "Baseball is just baseball.
- |
  

- Asked what he'd miss about Japanese baseball, Ichiro said, "There is nothing I will miss about Japanese baseball.
- |
  

- Off the field, I will miss my dog.
- "\" Asked his dog's name, Ichiro said, \""
- I would not wish to say without first asking its permission.
- |
  

- When asked what he would like to do on an off-day, Ichiro answered, "I want to watch American kids playing baseball in a grass field, running around, and getting hoarse in the voice with my wife.
- |
  

- Ichiro told a reporter, "They say you are successful in baseball if you only fail seventy percent of the time, that going three-for-ten is successful.
- |
  

- As long as I play, I will look for a way to improve on that.
- |
  

- If a pitcher beats me seven of ten times, I can accept that.
- |
  

- But if I get myself out in some of those at-bats, that I can improve on.
- |
  

- What if I cut down on one, two outs in those ten at-bats by doing something better?
- |
  

- Cut your mistakes, you improve.
- |
  

- In this game, there's something every day you can be disappointed with.
- |
  

- The biggest adjustment has been that in Japan, the tempo of a pitcher was like one-two-and-three.
- |
  

- Here, it's more one-two-three, with no 'and,' so I had to find the way to take the 'and' out of my swing to match that tempo.
- |
  

- I did it by changing the stride with my front foot.
- |
  

- It was enough.
- |
  

- I cannot be satisfied with a number, because it may not reflect how you did.
- |
  

- It you set a goal, achieving it may satisfy you and you won't try to go beyond that goal.
- |
  

- Every at-bat, there's something to learn from, something to improve.
- |
  

- It's in the seeking that you find satisfaction.
- |
  

- When Ichiro visited a Seattle grammar school and was asked by students for advice, he said, "Find something you like to do as soon as possible.
- "\" Before leaving the school, he said, \""
- I don't know whether I'm going to be a baseball player in ten years, but I hope I can see you in the future.
