- A group of young male lions are lying on a hilltop in the shade of a lone tree.
- |
  

- It is a scorching hot day on the savanna, and from far off in the distance a bigger, older male lion comes trotting toward them.
- |
  

- "As he gets closer, the younger lions can see that he's a mess: his mane is full of burs, he's covered with dirt, there's scratches on his face, and he's panting so much his tongue is practically dragging on the ground."
- |
  

- He lies down in the shade next to the other lions, and the younger, smaller lions notice that there's blood around his mouth.
- |
  

- He licks his chops, and then says, "One fucking rabbit.
- |
  

- Two days hunting, and that's it.
- |
  

- And a scrawny, sickly old rabbit at that.
- |
  

- I tell you guys, this endless hunt for meat can be a real pain in the ass.
- "\" The other lions don't say anything; one shifts uncomfortably, one scratches himself, and another just closes his eyes."
- |
  

- The old lion notices the silence and looks over at the others.
- |
  

- He sees the skin hanging on their ribs and their jutting hip bones.
- |
  

- He bites his lower lip and turns away.
- |
  

- He looks off in the distance and says, "
- Ah, what are you gonna do?
- |
  

- Two porn stars, a man and a woman, are going at it during a shoot.
- |
  

- They're doing it doggy style, and the director keeps urging them to do it faster, since they're in sort of a homestretch two-shot.
- |
  

- So they're really going at it, and the woman kind of looks over her shoulder at the man and says, "Ooh, you feel so good inside me!
- "\" And the man thinks to himself, I choose to believe you."
- |
  

- A salesman is sitting in the reception area of a big corporation, waiting to give a presentation to some of the people there.
- |
  

- He is kept waiting almost 40 minutes beyond the time of his appointment, and then he's finally ushered into a conference room.
- |
  

- He goes in, and sitting around a big table are two Jews, an African-American woman, and a gay guy of Chinese descent.
- |
  

- The salesman goes into his pitch, for software or a phone system or something, and it's pretty evident a couple minutes into it that these four people couldn't care less, especially the younger Jew, who keeps checking his BlackBerry.
- |
  

- But he plows through the presentation anyway, and when he finishes, everybody shakes his hand and thanks him.
- |
  

- He goes out to his car and starts to drive home.
- |
  

- On the road, his cell phone rings and he answers it.
- |
  

- It's his wife, and she asks him to pick up a couple of groceries on his way home.
- |
  

- He says OK.
- |
  

- She says, are you OK?
- |
  

- And he says, yeah, I'm fine.
- |
  

- She says OK.
- |
  

- He hangs up, and this commercial for anti-itch powder comes on the radio, and it's got all these country-sounding old people giving testimonials about how this powder completely improved the quality of their lives.
- |
  

- And the salesman starts crying.
- |
  

- Big choked sobs.
- |
  

- He shades his eyes with his left hand so that the other drivers can't see that he's crying and says, "And I don't even fucking care about this shit!
- |
  

- Two light bulbs are lying in their cardboard sleeve on a shelf somewhere.
- |
  

- The first light bulb is a real nervous type.
- |
  

- He's been going on and on.
- |
  

- "\"What if I don't light up?"
- |
  

- Seriously, what if I don't?
- |
  

- I will just fucking die!
- |
  

- God, I'm freaking out.
- |
  

- And thanks to our fucking packaging, we don't know whether we're in a store or a warehouse, or if we're sitting under someone's kitchen sink moments away from being screwed in and turned on.
- |
  

- What if there's something wrong with my filament?
- |
  

- I mean, it feels OK to me, but there's not really any way of knowing for sure until I get hit with some current.
- |
  

- Sure, I passed the factory test and lit up just fine, but what if .
- |
  

- "\" The second light bulb has had enough."
- |
  

- "\"Will you shut the fuck up!"
- |
  

- Just shut up!
- "\" There is a long awkward silence."
- |
  

- Then the first light bulb says, "
- Well, what else are we supposed to talk about?
- |
  

- "The guy who betrayed Anne Frank to the Nazis is eating lunch with his wife in an Amsterdam caf\xE9."
- |
  

- "They both order the same thing: a cup of tea, soup, and a bowl of oatmeal."
- |
  

- So first the waiter brings the tea, and when he's setting it down, the guy and his wife notice that the waiter has his thumbs in the cups.
- |
  

- They both kind of shrug and laugh a little, but go ahead and start drinking the tea.
- |
  

- Next comes the soup, and once again the waiter has his thumbs hooked over the edge of the bowls so far that they're actually in the soup.
- |
  

- This time the guy and his wife are a little more irritated, but they figure what the hell, and go ahead and eat the soup.
- |
  

- Then the oatmeal arrives, and sure enough, the waiter's got both thumbs deep into the oatmeal.
- |
  

- He sets the bowls down and licks his thumbs clean as he returns to the kitchen.
- |
  

- The wife has completely lost her appetite, and just picks at her oatmeal on the opposite side of the bowl from where the waiter had had his thumb.
- |
  

- The guy eats as much of the oatmeal as he can, but leaves the area around the hole left by the waiter's thumb untouched.
- |
  

- The waiter drops off the check, and the guy leaves some money on the table.
- |
  

- The wife does a quick count of the guilders and realizes that her husband is leaving an almost 30 percent tip.
- |
  

- "\"Are you crazy?"
- |
  

- That waiter was awful!
- |
  

- He had his thumbs in every item of food that he brought to the table.
- |
  

- And now you're going to reward him with such a handsome tip?
- "\" The guy looks at her as he's putting on his hat and says, \""
- Honey, have a heart.
- |
  

- I think he's retarded.
- |
  

- A priest has been summoned for a meeting with the archbishop.
- |
  

- He's ushered into the archbishop's office, and the archbishop tells him that there's a conference at the Vatican the next week, and that he wants him to go there and represent their archdiocese at the conference.
- |
  

- He also tells him that he's going to get to meet the pope.
- |
  

- So the priest is very excited and honored, and the next week, he flies to Rome.
- |
  

- When he gets there, he goes and rents a car and starts driving to the Vatican.
- |
  

- He's driving along a deserted stretch of autostrada when a unicorn comes bounding out of the woods, and&#8212;BAM!
- |
  

- The dazed priest slowly gets out of the mangled Fiat and goes over to where the unicorn's lying.
- |
  

- He stands there for a second in disbelief, marveling at the beauty of the dying creature.
- |
  

- Then he notices that it seems as if the unicorn is trying to speak, so he gets down and cradles its head in his arms and leans in to listen.
- |
  

- The unicorn turns his eyes toward the priest and, with his dying breath, says, "All my life, I never got to do what I wanted.
