  PART I: ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
  Everyone loves Abraham Lincoln. How could you not -- the Great
  Emancipator, "a house divided...", the Gettysburg Address, walking ten
  miles to give an old lady her change, and so on. But let's consider, if
  only for a moment, what history's view of him would be if, on that
  fateful night at the Ford Theater, he'd seen John Wilkes Booth coming?
  And what if -- just for the sake of argument -- he'd grabbed Mary Todd
  and used her as a human shield?
  Makes you think.
