- DAVID KRUCHOWSKI,
- WORKING AT A STRIP CLUB
- WITH MOM.
- |
  

- "Q: When did you work in a strip club?"
- "A: It was 1987."
- |
  

- I was 18, and had enlisted in the Air Force.
- |
  

- Due to a large influx in recruitment, it was October before I would leave for basic training.
- |
  

- I needed a screw-off job to keep me in party money over the summer.
- |
  

- "It was serendipity\x97my mother, who tended bar there, helped me land a job at the cover-charge table."
- "Q: What was the name of the club?"
- "A: Tuna's."
- |
  

- Not for the obvious reasons, but because that was the nickname of the original owner.
- |
  

- He was a man of ample girth who was renowned for ordering a large pizza to be delivered to him uncut.
- |
  

- Then he would fold it in half and eat it like a sandwich.
- The bar's logo at the time was an unlicensed Charlie the Tuna holding a bikini top.
- "Q: Did you like the job?"
- "A: It was everything I hoped it would be."
- |
  

- In addition to having a view of the stage, albeit a distant one, there was plenty of slack-off time.
- |
  

- Most of the time I would sit there and read.
- |
  

- In retrospect, I wish GameBoy would've been around at the time.
- The cover-charge table was between the stage and the dancers' dressing room, so I'd get a good look as the dancers would change between sets.
- |
  

- However, at the time, I was terribly shy, so I tended just to sneak glances.
- |
  

- Plus, having Mom working at the bar, I tried to keep in line.
- "Q: Could you see your mom from where you stood?"
- "A: Yep, and, more importantly, she could see me."
- "Q: Did you and your mom carpool?"
- "A: The bar wasn't too far from the house, so I would just walk."
- |
  

- She started work a few hours before I did.
- |
  

- The club opened at 6 o'clock, but the dancers didn't start until 9 o'clock.
- "Q: Did you ever see anyone hit on your mom?"
- "A: No, I was spared the gruesome details of that."
- |
  

- It probably happened, but I didn't pay attention to the goings-on at the bar.
- |
  

- There was one guy, though, known throughout town as "Bert the Pervert," who would buy my mom lingerie.
- "Q: Please don't kill me: Was your mom good-looking?"
- "A: Stop it."
- |
  

- I can't afford therapy.
- "Q: Where was this place?"
- "A: The bar was in a northern Minnesota iron-ore-mining community."
- |
  

- "For an idea of the clientele, watch the movie  North Country \x97it was filmed in the same town as Tuna's."
- |
  

- There were also a lot of bikers, but they tended to be self-regulating and the best behaved.
- |
  

- Any time one of the bikers would start causing trouble, his buddies would haul him out.
- "Q: Were the girls completely naked?"
- "A: They had to wear G-strings\x97I think that was state law."
- |
  

- Toward the end of the summer, a new city ordinance was passed that required that their nipples be covered as well.
- |
  

- That caused a huge uproar in the club.
- |
  

- I thought some of the guys were going to cry.
- |
  

- Usually the dancers wore sequined pasties, but some of the skankier ones just put Band-Aids over their nipples.
- "Q: Did they serve alcohol?"
- "A: Oh yes."
- |
  

- In northern Minnesota, even the elementary schools serve alcohol.
- "Q: Did you tell any of your friends about this job?"
- "A: Yeah, they knew about it."
- |
  

- I told my best friend that I could get him in any time he wanted, but he never took me up on it.
- |
  

- I later found out that he was gay, so that explained that.
- "Q: Did you ever have problems with the clientele?"
- "A: The biggest problem was that a lot of the dancers were also hookers, so there'd be guys trying to get into the dressing rooms to solicit services."
- |
  

- At least once a night the owner would have to kick out someone trying to catch a hummer in the dressing room.
- |
  

- They'd usually just go outside and do it in the alley instead, or in a car in the parking lot.
- The dancers were all "free agents" that came, for the most part, from Minneapolis. They didn't actually work for the club. There were different dancers every week.
- The second-biggest problem was that the stairwell was separate from the main club, and invariably, toward the end of the night, someone would piss down the stairs.
- |
  

- I think that rankled the club owner worse than anything.
- |
  

- Eventually he installed a hidden camera at the top of the stairs and recorded the last couple hours each night.
- |
  

- "I recall him being very surprised with the results\x97it was people that he least expected that were doing it."
- |
  

- Of course, this was well before the term "passive-aggressive" was bandied about.
- "Q: So who were the people who peed on the stairs?"
- |
  

- Were they people who worked there?
- "A: No, but at least one of the guys was one of the very well-behaved regulars."
- "Q: How long did you and your mom end up working there?"
- "A: I took a couple of weeks off before leaving for basic training in mid-October."
- |
  

- "Mom wasn't there for much longer beyond that, either\x97she started working in a nursing home after she'd had enough of the drunks and the cigarette smoke."
- "Q: Are you proud that you had this job?"
- "A: The only thing that appalls me about the experience is that I actually ate bar food."
- |
  

- In a strip club.
- |
  

- Almost every night.
- |
  

- Yeesh.
- "Q: What kind of food is \"bar food at a strip club\"?"
- "A: I used to order chicken strips a lot."
- |
  

- "But they had the usual range of nasty bar food: bad hamburgers, deep-fried mushrooms, pickled eggs, and the like."
- "Q: But overall, it was a good job?"
- "A: Overall, it was a good experience\x97the owner was a great guy, and I was a night owl back then, so the hours worked out great."
- |
  

- Most guys would think that it would be their dream job, but really, you get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again.
- |
  

- Plus, the music was pretty much always the same.
- |
  

- It got so that if I heard ZZ Top's "Legs" one more time, I think I would've lost it.
