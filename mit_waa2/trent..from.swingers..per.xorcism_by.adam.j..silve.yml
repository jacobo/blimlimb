- Baby, this is money.
- |
  

- I'm swaying my big bear claws and dousing my magic demon potion on a brutal-looking baby who likes to party.
- |
  

- She's just like this green goblin, and I've got her tied to the bedposts.
- |
  

- I'm looking at my pagan potion and I'm thinking to myself, "How do I kill this goblin?
- Her head is doing twirlie-whirlies and she's smiling at how money I am.
- |
  

- You know it's not so much me as it is the priestly garb I'm wearing.
- |
  

- She's a freaky baby that is digging the outfit.
- |
  

- I'm performing an exorcism in Georgetown, so guys like me gotta kick it old-school.
- |
  

- And if that means I gotta wear all black with a touch of white, then so be it.
- Fuck me, you say?
- |
  

- Ahh-hahaha-ha-ha, you're right you want to fuck me, baby.
- |
  

- Oh, you wanna play devil-worshipper games?
- |
  

- We can play devil-worshipper games.
- |
  

- I can be Damien.
- |
  

- Look at this face.
- |
  

- OK, this is your little mischievous, trouble-making Damien.
- |
  

- Watch me pout.
- |
  

- See this face?
- |
  

- It's hurt, but it's not really hurt.
- |
  

- It's thinking devious thoughts.
- |
  

- It's thinking about deviant things to do to your filthy potty mouth.
- My mother is a cocksucker ass-eating whore?
- |
  

- I don't think you're qualified to be making those kind of observations, darling.
- |
  

- No, I don't think you are.
- |
  

- But here, take some more evil-cleansing potion, baby.
- I'm doing my thing with the thing and whoa .
- |
  

- I'm tumbling down this steep slope of steps.
- |
  

- OK, fine, I'm the asshole?
- |
  

- Yeah?
- |
  

- I would never party with a demon child anyway.
- |
  

- I'm out.

  I'm doing my thing with the thing and whoa ... some kind of crazy devil-baby force pushes me through a window and I'm tumbling down this steep slope of steps. OK, fine, I'm the asshole? Yeah? I would never party with a demon child anyway. I'm out.
