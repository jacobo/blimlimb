- Dear President Obama,
- I want to tell you hi.

- Do you work with Santa Claus?

- Can I meet you in your house?
- |
  

- Can I say bye to you after I meet you?
- |
  

- And then can I meet you again?
- |
  

- And then again after that?

- Dear Barack Obama,
- You are one of my friends.

- I cannot believe you are president.

- In our community, you're the best guy I've ever seen.
- |
  

- You rock the whole world.

- Dear Obama,
- If you were going to make up a holiday, what would it be?
- |
  

- If you were going to make a law, what would it be?
- |
  

- I liked you before you were even president.
- |
  

- I'm friends with Jerey Best, the girl that was on CNN and also sent you a letter.

- Dear President Obama,
- I think that this year you will have to do a lot of work.
- |
  

- One thing that you will have to do is to make school more important for everyone.
- |
  

- That way, kids will always do a good job.
- |
  

- If I were the president, I would work really hard to change Boston and other cities.
- |
  

- I would make the world very smart.
- |
  

- I would make all of the world work really hard and always do the best job that they can.
