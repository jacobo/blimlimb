- "Professor Nichols:"
- The following are minor errors that I ask you to keep in mind as you read my paper of September 11, 2000.
- |
  

- The title of the paper, "Aztec Systems," is actually meant to read "Implications of Loin-Cloth Breakage for the Aztec Military Complex.
- |
  

- The paper, "Aztec Systems," is best viewed in the "Georgia" font.
- |
  

- The printing in "Times New Roman" was beyond my control and should be disregarded.
- |
  

- The "[sic]" following the word "efflorescence" in the quote at the top of page five should be removed.
- |
  

- That is actually the correct spelling.
- |
  

- All citations of "Fraud, 1907," should be changed to read "Freud, 1903.
- |
  

- "The section titled \"Elizabeth Boone: Fink!"
- "\" beginning on page 11 should be struck entirely."
- |
  

- You will not mention it from this date forward.
- |
  

- Pages 14 through 22, containing only the letter "e," should be omitted, save for one instance of the letter "e" necessary to complete the last word on page 13, "cabbage."
- |
  

- The final section, headed "Conclusions," should be attributed entirely to Berdan, 1975. It is, in fact, a direct quote.
- |
  

- Citations numbers 1 through 4 and 7 through 30 should be removed from the "Works Cited" section, leaving only Berdan and Fraud.
- |
  

- While the eight blank pages included in the paper are for your own thoughts and comments, I intend for them to count towards the thirty-page requirement.
- Thank you for marking these changes on your copy of my paper.
- |
  

- Have a pleasant Rosh Hashanah weekend.
