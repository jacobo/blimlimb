- DIARY OF A FLYING MAN
- "Mankind's oldest dream has become my reality: I can fly."
- |
  

- This morning, running after a five-dollar bill blowing along the pavement, I simply lifted into the air.
- |

- "\" And just before I soared skyward, I stumbled and got an oil stain on my trousers."
- |
  

- At least I hope it's only oil and not PCBs.

- Testing the limits of my astonishing new power, I flew to the dry cleaners to pick up my pants.
- |
  

- They still have a faint stain on the knee, like a ghostly silhouette of Donald Manes.
- |
  

- My first flight to work reveals the city as more than a chaotic pile of limestone and steel.
- |
  

- I watch enraptured as streets and skyscrapers organize themselves into what is undeniably some patternlike shape!
- |
  

- City scandals undermine morale in many agencies, even here at the Pools and Playgrounds Planning Board.
- |
  

- "To lift our spirits, the boss, Mr. Kauffmann, posted a sign: \"More Than   Days Without a Work-Stopping Felony Arrest."
- "\" As he updated the count to eleven, I smiled, delighted that in a mere three hours I'd be flying to lunch."
- |
  

- I can cruise comfortably only at a walking pace.
- |
  

- With effort I can attain running speed, but just for short bursts.
- |
  

- From now on, only light beer.
- |
  

- If I could sustain higher velocities, that would change everything.
- |
  

- "Of course rain would still be a problem, particularly when I'm carrying groceries: those plastic bags really dig into your hands!"
- |
  

- What was wrong with plain old paper bags?
- |
  

- Why can't things stay as they are?
- |
  

- Ah -- my unprecedented aerial gift has made me introspective.
- |
  

- Mr. Anselmo, my landlord, is complaining about my coming and going from the roof.
- |
  

- The thumping disturbs the top-floor tenants and I'm causing leaks in the tar paper.
- |
  

- Now I'll have to walk to that parking lot near the piers.
- |
  

- It's inconvenient, but what can I do?
- |
  

- To take off from the ground, I need to run about a block and a half.
- |
  

- Well, if I leave fifteen minutes early, I can still fly to work.
- |
  

- Windy day.
- |
  

- Got a bit airsick during the commute, so I did the last half by subway.
- |
  

- Home.
- |
  

- In the mail was a summons to jury duty.
- |
  

- Threw it away.
- |
  

- After all, I am a flying man.
- |
  

- Mr. Kauffmann caught me doing personal work at the office.
- |
  

- One of my bench designs.
- |
  

- This one has armrests shaped like a sphinx with the head of Bess Myerson, and legs with the trim ankles of a former Miss America.
- |
  

- Its feet are shod in high-heel pumps.
- |
  

- It's the best yet in my "Under a Cloud" series. Someday, each corner of Broadway, from Inwood to Battery Park, will have a bench honoring a former Koch official. That'll show Kauffmann. Besides, once the indictments are handed down in the BenchTech investigation the city will start handling bench designs in-house, maybe from our office.
- |
  

- Flew to Yonah Schimmel's for those delicious cherry-cheese knishes.
- |
  

- They were all out, so I had apple.
- |
  

- Cruising uptown, I was surprised to see so many rooftops littered with old refrigerators crammed with review copies of best-sellers, eventually to be sold at the Strand, I suppose.
- |
  

- Even in our throwaway age, recycling thrives.
- |
  

- A few blocks later I glanced down and saw a crew of uniformed firefighters hand-fitting mosaic tiles on the rooftop love grotto of an assistant deputy mayor.
- |
  

- On city time!
- |
  

- A big one glanced up and hollered, "What are you looking at, creep?
- "\" I hope he didn't recognize me."
- |
  

- Maybe I can use my fantastic skill to nail some of these guys.
- |
  

- Out flying around.
- |
  

- Forgot to turn on phone machine.
- |
  

- I wonder if anybody good called.
- |
  

- Flew to cash machine on way to work.
- |
  

- It was out of order, so I flew to another.
- |
  

- It took three more stops before I finally got my money.
- |
  

- "I couldn't even use a customer service phone to complain: some busted, some stolen."
- |
  

- I shall write an angry letter.
- |
  

- My fabulous ornithoid prowess makes me less passive in the face of institutional authority.
- Then, far below me, near the Williamsburg Bridge, I spotted some cops napping on the job.
- |
  

- With their little sleep masks in place, three or four assistant police commissioners dozed in hammocks slung between their squad cars.
- |
  

- Sleazy!
- |
  

- Circled until I felt dizzy, which made it really hard to take notes.
- |
  

- I dropped my notebook on a guy!
- |
  

- It just grazed his shoulder, but he was furious.
- |
  

- I gave a phony name, Chadwick Lancaster, but you could tell he didn't believe me.
- |
  

- I wish I could think faster.
- |
  

- As I flew away, he gave me the finger.
- |
  

- I snapped back, "Oh yeah?
- |
  

- Same to you, stupid!
- "\" Has my unbelievable supernormal talent taught me nothing?"
- |
  

- "\"Accidentally\""
- |
  

- Then I bombed a limo with a thirty-two ounce jar of applesauce.
- |
  

- I am not bound by the laws that govern ordinary mortals.
- |
  

- As I glided home after work, some guy clambered onto the roof of a Jews for Jesus van and harangued me with a bullhorn.
- |
  

- He asked if I was Jewish, and the easiest way to avoid an idiotic conversation was to say no, but then I felt guilty.
- |
  

- A creature of the skies, I've learned to observe the urban ecology.
- |
  

- At the edge of a vacant lot a pack of feral hamsters reduces a cat to its skeleton in seconds.
- |
  

- Or else it was a bunch of kids in Davy Crockett hats stripping a car.
- |
  

- Above eighty-five feet my sense of scale is unreliable.
- |
  

- Hovered over Central Park watching a riding mower cut a vast Mercedes-Benz insignia into the Sheep Meadow, like a huge chlorophyll billboard.
- |
  

- Adjusting my Nikon, I nearly crashed into a tree.
- |
  

- I've got to get one of those autofocus cameras.
- |
  

- My excursions among the spires lift my spirits, reminding me that nature endures, even in the metropolis.
- |
  

- On fire escapes and window boxes the first vegetables of summer are ripening.
- |
  

- Say what you will about bio-engineering, those beach ball tomatoes look delicious, although if one fell it could crush a Subaru.
- |
  

- Five crime sightings today.
- |
  

- One payoff, three kickbacks, a bribe.
- |
  

- The new telephoto lens is bulky, but it takes a great picture.
- |
  

- If I had a way to carry luggage, I could fly to Fire Island for the weekend.
- |
  

- An in-flight snack would be good, too.
- |
  

- Smoked almonds.
- |
  

- And some kind of beverage.
- |
  

- When the infrared photos came back from the lab, I saw that Thursday's sighting was not a bagman, Just the kid from the deli delivering a roast beef sandwich.
- |
  

- I'll emend the log book.
- |
  

- Got really tired flying to work today, so I snatched a ride on the roof of a bus.
- |
  

- Cost to me?
- |
  

- Zero.
- Early evening, soared over Queens.
- |
  

- There was a deb party in Shea Stadium.
- |
  

- A bar was set up in each dugout; buffet tables lined the base paths; heedless teen socialites capered on the pitchers mound.
- |
  

- But I thought the stadium was closed all week for resodding?
- |
  

- Then I saw a borough president trundling a wheelbarrow full of cash across right field out beyond the 410 feet sign and into his official car.
- |
  

- I'm going to rip this town wide open!
- |
  

- And I got all the evidence I need before the wide-angle lens fell into the bullpen.
- |
  

- At the office I tripped over a trash can, churning up records of Kauffmann's involvement with a cabal of civil court judges.
- |
  

- They're conspirators in a crooked franchising scheme to install cigarette machines atop jungle gyms in city playgrounds and underwater in city pools.
- |
  

- That's it.
- |
  

- I'm going to the papers.
- |
  

- My meeting with the reporter wasn't all I'd hoped for.
- |
  

- She does want the story, but she can't get to it for a while.
- |
  

- Next week she's assigned to the wicker supplement.
- |
  

- And after that, she'll be filling in at "Buying and Owning.
- A social disaster!
- |
  

- Had a big date with Leslie, a new designer at the office.
- |
  

- I whispered, "Let me fly you to the stars on wings of love," and then I jerked her off her feet and dropped her on the coffee table. That's it. I'm cutting out pie altogether, and tomorrow I start working out with weights.
- |
  

- "No Nautilus machine can help me now: my powers are fading."
- |
  

- How can I resume ordinary life having known the embrace of the air?
- |
  

- I am desolate.
- |
  

- Awoke with odd flickering at the edge of my field of vision.
- |
  

- "Gradually I realized what was happening: I'm developing X-ray eyes."
- |
  

- Already I can nearly see through a sheet of newspaper.
- |
  

- This will irrevocably rend the drab fabric of my life.
- |
  

- Kauffmann resigned!
- |
  

- He wants to spend more time with  his family for reasons of health while going into private consulting at a major university to do the teaching he loves.
- |
  

- Perhaps I misjudged him.
- |
  

- False alarm.
- |
  

- Just a malfunctioning fluorescent lamp.
- |
  

- "Otherwise, my vision is what it's always been: OK in right eye, slightly astigmatic in left."
- |
  

- "No mistake this time: I can move objects with the force of my will -- telekinetic power."
- |
  

- So far I can't budge anything heavier than a few pounds, and my range is restricted to about four feet, but still!
- |
  

- After breakfast I slid the Sgt.
- |
  

- Pepper CD (Can it really be fifty years?
- |
  

- Oh.
- |
  

- Twenty years) across the coffee table.
- |
  

- I brace for the unimaginable metamorphosis my life is about to undergo.
- |
  

- May I use my new power wisely!
