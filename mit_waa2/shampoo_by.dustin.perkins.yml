  Is your hair damaged? Is it fine and frazzled? Does it shine like it is
  supposed to? Does it shine like it is not supposed to? Is your hair quiet
  and demure or boisterous and unruly? Is it soft like silk or soft like the
  "g" in "tough"? Is your hair of appropriate length and color for a person of
  your intelligence, or do you have dumb hair? Does your hair hold any degrees
  or certificates or is it self-taught? Is it afraid to cry?
  If you answered yes or no, then you need shampoo. Shampoo is a complicated
  substance of infinite constitution and utility. Shampoo is supposed to make
  you believe that you are a part of something larger than yourself. Shampoo
  is a smart person that can untangle your hair's illlogic. Shampoo is the
  most coldly rational of all the toiletries.
  There is shampoo to make your hair smell like apricots, and shampoo designed
  to make babies cry. You need to use a lot of some shampoo, and others
  require you to use less. Some shampoos require that you purchase them to
  keep your other shampoos company, while others are merely for putting in the
  eyes of polite rabbits. Most shampoo is acquired by theft, and
  establishments which encourage this practice can be found in any American
  city.
  Anything can be used to make shampoo. For example, papaya, cucumber essence,
  purple rain and murder would combine to make a shampoo that sells for $4.00
  and comes in a purple bottle. If gold were made into shampoo it would cost
  $4.00 and come in a blue bottle. Some shampoo is so good that children are
  not allowed to buy it and people of faith regret its influence in their
  lives. In Great Britain, Shampoo has three "O"s and a "U." No one there has
  ever heard of it.
  All types of people use shampoo. Very poor people use shampoo made of old
  mules and ash, and very rich people use shampoo made of poor people. Women
  use shampoo that smells like pi&#241;a coladas. Men get important vitamins by
  eating that shampoo. Imaginary people use shampoo made of pure light. Dead
  people use shampoo that comes in a green bottle. You can only get it through
  the mail.
  No one knows what shampoo does. No one knows where shampoo works, or how
  much it makes. Some people think that it makes money simply by existing in
  all times and places, while others think shampoo is living off an
  inheritance. No one knows what shampoo is or how to pronounce its name. No
  one has ever used shampoo or thought that it should exist. A woman once
  washed her hair with beer. It drove her insane.
