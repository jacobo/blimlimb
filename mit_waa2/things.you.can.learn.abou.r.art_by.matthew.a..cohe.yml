- Harry is getting older, but he's still not old enough to get bifocals.

- Harry will learn a powerful new spell that will help him fight off the forces of darkness.

- The lady who illustrates the covers ran out of blue paint on  The Order of the Phoenix , so she had to switch to green.

- Will the seventh book be hot pink?

- I, for one, can't wait to find out.

- "I'm rather proud of the fact that I can not only define but also spell the word doppelg\xE4nger, and, frankly, it doesn't come up a lot in casual conversation."

- I've read Dostoyevsky.

- We still can't determine the identity of the half-blood prince, but we can safely assume that this mysterious figure has been supplying Harry with all the fixings for his awesome, glowing bong.
