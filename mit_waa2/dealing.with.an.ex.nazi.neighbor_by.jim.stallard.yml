- You do not need to tell the ex-Nazi what the meeting is about; simply ask him when would be a convenient time for you to stop by for a few minutes.
- |
  

- Don't schedule the meeting too late at night, as the ex-Nazi will be old and probably has an early bedtime.

- Also, consult the History Channel listings to ensure you do not interrupt a night of nostalgia for the ex-Nazi, making him less likely to be conciliatory.
- Enlist the help of other (non-Nazi) neighbors.

- Share your concerns with other neighbors and ask them if they will stand with you in your intervention with the ex-Nazi.
- |
  

- You will be much more persuasive if you can demonstrate that many people disapprove of his past behavior.
- Gather and organize documentation.
- |
  

- The ex-Nazi neighbor is less likely to put up a fight if you can confront him with evidence of his misdeeds, so do your best to compile photographs, signed orders, and oral testimony.
- |
  

- This record of his actions will drive home to the ex-Nazi that you are not simply ganging up on him like a bunch of sorority girls.
- Go as a group to the ex-Nazi neighbor's house at the appointed time.
- |
  

- When he sees the crowd of people, the ex-Nazi may not want to invite you in.
- |
  

- Be prepared to use force to push back the door, but take care not to cause harm to the ex-Nazi while entering his house.
- |
  

- It is best to file into his living room and stand as a group.
- |
  

- One neighbor should guard the door to the basement steps so the ex-Nazi does not impulsively rush to his bunker.
- Take charge of the meeting.
- |
  

- State your concerns about his behavior in an assertive tone.
- |
  

- Remind him that he hurt many human beings and that this behavior will not be tolerated.
- |
  

- Avoid using labels, but point out that he caused pain and discomfort to a large number of people.
- |
  

- Above all, remain calm but firm.
- |
  

- The ex-Nazi neighbor may try to bait you by bringing up Dresden or muttering German curses, but getting emotional will only make the situation worse for everyone.
- Present a united front.
- |
  

- You and your non-Nazi neighbors may have your differences about lawn maintenance or barking dogs, but you should make clear to the ex-Nazi that you all agree his past behavior is unacceptable and that he needs to leave the neighborhood.
- |
  

- The ex-Nazi may try to create a diversion by scapegoating a segment of your group, but do not buy into his arguments, even if they begin to sound reasonable.
- |
  

- Calmly bring the discussion back to the issue at hand.
- Force the ex-Nazi to agree to a move-out date.
- |
  

- Explain to the ex-Nazi neighbor that after he is relocated, you will be taking possession of his house and belongings and that surely he can understand the precedent for this.
- Get the agreement in writing.
- |
  

- Immediately after the meeting, send a letter to the ex-Nazi thanking him for his time and laying out your understanding of what was decided.
- |
  

- As a courtesy, you may want to send follow-up letters as the move-out date approaches.
- Send thank-you notes to the non-Nazi neighbors who participated.
- |
  

- It is imperative that your non-Nazi neighbors know you appreciate their help with the intervention in case a similar situation arises in the future.
- |
  

- You all need to keep an eye out for further threats to your block.
- |
  

- Come to think of it, wasn't it a bit odd last year at the Christmas party when kindly old Mr. "Jenkins" from "New York" couldn't tell you which team Lou Gehrig played for?
