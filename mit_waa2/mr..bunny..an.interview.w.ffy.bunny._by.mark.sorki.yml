- "Q: So, how did you go about changing your name?"
- "BUNNY: Well, I had to file an affidavit stating that I wasn't married, that I didn't have children, and that I was aware that my name might subject me to public ridicule &#8212; which I thought was really amusing."
- |
  

- You have to publish once in legal notices.
- |
  

- All in all, it cost $30 to download the forms, then a little over $100 to file, and $78 to publish.
- |
  

- I think you can get by without paying for the forms, but the rest you sort of need.
- |
  

- This is the second time I've changed my name, actually.
- |
  

- The first time was in Oregon on my twenty-fifth birthday.
- |
  

- It was much less expensive back then.
- "Q: What did you change your name to twenty-five years ago?"
- "BUNNY: I changed my first name from James to Ames."
- |
  

- I was named after an annoying grandfather, and I never liked it.
- |
  

- One night I had a revelation that I could just drop the "J" and have something new. Ames is a much nicer name. It sounds like "amiable" and "amigo," and other variations on the word "friend.
- "\" So twenty-five years later, I'm due for another birthday present."
- |
  

- I've decided that Ames Michael Montgomery is a very serious name, and I'm not the world's most serious person.
- "Q: How did you arrive at the name Fluffy Bunny?"
- "BUNNY: Bunny is sort of a pet name in the house."
- |
  

- There's lots of rabbit stuff in here, as you can see.
- "Q: Indeed."
- "BUNNY: Those are new rabbits because of the name change."
- |
  

- Somebody sent me these bunnies over here, and somebody else sent me that one.
- |
  

- I purchased that one.
- |
  

- I like the evil bunnies, they're like something out of Monty Python.
- |
  

- You know, everybody thinks of them as fluffy, cute little creatures, but they're just rodents &#8212; like rats.
- "Q: Does that explain the sculpture of those plastic rats in the corner of the room?"
- "BUNNY: Actually, my sweetheart made that."
- "Q: Who is more responsible for the decor around here?"
- "BUNNY: I am."
- "Q: Are you a decorator by profession?"
- "BUNNY: No, it's just a hobby."
- |
  

- I'm an intravenous nurse at NYU Hospital.
- "Q: What are your specific responsibilities?"
- "BUNNY: Inserting needles into veins, for the most part, and doing it well."
- "Q: Do you, um, hop from ward to ward, or are you assigned to a specific part of the hospital?"
- "BUNNY: I go pretty much all over the hospital except for pediatrics."
- |
  

- The other day I saw a patient who is 107 years old.
- "Q: Wow, that's remarkable."
- |
  

- That's four name changes.
- "BUNNY: Right."
- |
  

- And she was totally lucid and rational and would have been perfectly capable of changing her name.
- |
  

- You know, it's not like I'm placing a value judgment on somebody for being one thing their whole life.
- |
  

- "The question is: are they happy?"
- |
  

- My father had two hairstyles his entire life, and I guess I understand that.
- |
  

- You want people to think that you're reliable, that you're a rock of stability in a chaotic world.
- "Q: How do you want people to react to your new name?"
- "BUNNY: With amusement, for the first part."
- |
  

- And then I want them to forget that they're amused by it.
- |
  

- It's not like I'm going to walk around wearing a fluffy bunny suit.
- |
  

- Ninety-five percent of the time I don't have a name to the world.
- |
  

- In the hospital, I wear my ID card at all times, but rarely do people want to know the name of the person jabbing them with a needle.
- |
  

- And they don't want to get stuck any more than they have to, so they're typically pretty quiet and helpful.
- |
  

- At some point, someone is probably going to check my ID card to see if I'm a legitimate person, and they'll find out that not only am I a person, I'm a bunny.
- "Q: Do you think of yourself as a performance artist?"
- "BUNNY: Not really."
- |
  

- The public life is very difficult.
- |
  

- The more you're in the public, the more it demands of you.
- |
  

- I was very visible for about a month in Oregon because my hair was blue and my beard was green.
- |
  

- There were lots of strangers who would want to encounter me, talk to me, react to me &#8212; it was exhausting.
- "Q: How did you celebrate the millennium?"
- "BUNNY: At the time, my hair was all the way down to my butt."
- |
  

- I had grown my hair for seven years, and I had a full beard.
- |
  

- Then, on December 31, 1999, I shaved everything.
- "Q: Do you feel that your identity is constantly evolving?"
- "BUNNY: I feel like I need to do something every once in a while that's a little difficult for me, personally, in order to grow."
- |
  

- Changing my name to Fluffy Bunny will engage me with reality, or with society, in a different way.
- |
  

- It's like an unmasking.
- "Q: Do you think people will expect you to act differently from now on?"
- "BUNNY: Not really."
- "Q: Seriously?"
- |
  

- What about Easter?
- "BUNNY: Oh, gosh, I hadn't thought about that."
- |
  

- I suppose there will be a lot of demands on me come Easter.
- "Q: One last thing: Does the \"A\" stand for Ames?"
- "BUNNY: No, it's just \"A."
- "\" That's really all that's left."
