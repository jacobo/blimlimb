- JUDITH REGAN  is in bed.
- |
  

- She wakes up.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN
- Last night I had the strangest dream.
- An angel came to me.
- |
  

- It seemed
- As though he tumbled down from heaven high.
- He had the gentlest tone.
- |
  

- His voice, it did beguile.
- He wanted me to make a book
- That turned back time to take a look
- At the O.J.
- |
  

- Simpson murder trial.
- Then he flew back up into the endless vault of sky.
- Part of me would like to go right back to bed.
- Instead I think I'll do just what the fallen angel said.
- |
  

- While she is singing,  O.J.
- |
  

- SIMPSON  appears at her bedside.
- |
  

- He walks slowly as a result of his injured knees, but when he hears his name mentioned he brightens.
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- Oh, how I wish that you would help me.
- I need another chance to state my case.
- I have been suffering for years now.
- Golfing and nightclubbing in disgrace.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN  hops out of bed.
- |
  

- She is fully dressed in a business suit.
- |
  

- She takes  O.J.
- |
  

- In the car, she begins to explain her plan.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN
- I'll rent us a studio.
- We'll talk about that night.
- America will see you
- In a wonderful new light.
- Obviously, we'll also
- Use the program to promote
- The sale of the tell-all
- Companion book you wrote
- Remembering the dead
- While honoring the living.
- It's quite a brilliant stroke.
- I'm shooting for Thanksgiving.
- |
  

- The limousine pulls up at a television studio.
- |
  

- O.J.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN  hops out after him.
- |
  

- The two of them enter and take their seats.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN
- I know that it is hard for you
- To relive your darkest day.
- Start when you are ready.
- Say what you want to say.
- O.
- J.
- Well, let's see.
- I've forgotten a lot.
- We were happily married and then we were not.
- There were fights.
- |
  

- There were drugs.
- There were rumors galore.
- Some of the rumors were hard to ignore.
- I am thinking in particular of one I heard one night,
- That she was in a threesome.
- |
  

- I felt that wasn't right.
- |
  

- Curtain parts.
- |
  

- Dry-ice smoke is released.
- |
  

- "The  FLASHBACK PLAYERS \x97puppet versions of  O.J."
- |
  

- "NICOLE , and  RON GOLDMAN \x97appear."
- |
  

- O.J.
- |
  

- NICOLE 's house.
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- I am mad.
- I am mad.
- Holy God am I mad.
- What I think
- I may do
- Is horrifically bad.
- In my hand,
- In my hand
- Is a dangerous knife.
- I am paying
- A visit
- To my wanton ex-wife.
- This is it.
- This is it.
- Bundy Drive, I presume.
- The children
- Are sleeping
- Upstairs in their rooms.
- What is that
- That I hear?
- There's a voice in my ear.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet.
- A waiter draws near.
- |
  

- RON GOLDMAN  approaches the house, holding  NICOLE 's glasses.
- |
  

- He rings the bell.
- |
  

- NICOLE  answers.
- |
  

- RON GOLDMAN
- I am just a simple, kindly waiter.
- I smile and bring exactly what you want.
- That is why I said that I might drop by later
- With the glasses that you left behind at the restaurant.
- NICOLE
- Thank you, Ron, oh, thank you, Ron.
- This is what we agreed upon.
- Now would you like to come in for a drink?
- I am wearing a black dress.
- It's kind of short, I guess.
- But we're all adults here, don't you think?
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- Stand back.
- Stand back.
- It's time for me
- To attack.
- Now I'll chop off your head
- Until you're good and dead.
- The ground will be stained red
- At the place where you bled.
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- |
  

- NICOLE  and  RON GOLDMAN .
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- Whatever I just did, I didn't do it.
- And if I did, I didn't.
- |
  

- That's denial.
- Does it bother me?
- Sure, it does, a little.
- "But I'll see you at the trial\x97"
- Or maybe I should say at the acquittal.
- |
  

- Dry-ice smoke fills the frame again.
- |
  

- The  FLASHBACK CHORUS  appears, consisting of puppet versions of Judge Lance Ito, Marcia Clark, Christopher Darden, Johnnie Cochran, Paula Barbieri, Kato Kaelin, Marcus Allen, Phil Spector, and Robert Blake.
- |
  

- CHORUS
- "Murder, mayhem, spousal abuse:"
- The Juice is loose!
- |
  

- The Juice is loose!
- "Trial, acquittal, civil award:"
- He who lives by the sword does not die by the sword.
- "Murder, mayhem, spousal abuse:"
- The Juice is loose!
- |
  

- The Juice is loose!
- "Book deal, magazines, TV show:"
- From open wounds great profits flow.
- |
  

- The  FLASHBACK PLAYERS  disappear with a puff of smoke, showing  O.J.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN  back in the TV studio.
- |
  

- JUDITH REGAN
- That puppet show was wonderful
- And really quite affecting.
- O.
- J.
- |
  

- That I'm detecting?
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- |
  

- O.
- J.
- I can't go on like this.
- My kids can't see me this way.
- The search for the real killers

- Of my lovely ex-wife.
- It begins in earnest today.

- JUDITH REGAN
- Oh, what a beautiful day.
- I've never had a feeling quite like this.
- The sun coming up in the east
- Feels like the sweetest kiss.
- I've published them all, from Canseco to Stern.
- Top cop Bernie Kerik was my client and lover.
