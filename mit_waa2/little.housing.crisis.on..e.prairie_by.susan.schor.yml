- Laura and Mary got up early the next morning, for Pa was arranging the financing that day.
- |
  

- They rode across the prairie in the covered wagon for a long time.
- |
  

- Finally, they stopped.
- "\"Here is where our house will be!"
- "\" Pa said."
- |
  

- Laura and Mary hurried to look.
- |
  

- All around them stretched the prairie.
- |
  

- For miles and miles, there was only grass and prairie hens and wild creatures.
- "\"Where is the school?"
- "\" Ma asked."
- "\"Where is the golf course?"
- "\" Mary wondered."
- "\"Where will the tax base come from to support the development of adequate infrastructure?"
- "\" Laura wanted to know."
- "\"Now, Laura, don't pester,\""
- |
  

- Ma said.
- But Pa chuckled.
- |
  

- "\"Well, little Half-Pint,\""
- |
  

- Laura, "all those things are right here, just waiting to be built with good old American know-how, elbow grease, and sticktoitiveness.
- "\"And perseverance,\""
- |
  

- Ma added.
- "\"That, too,\""
- |
  

- Pa agreed.
- Just then Jack the brindle bulldog barked.
- |
  

- A man Laura and Mary had never seen before rode up on a mule.
- "\"Hullo, Edwards!"
- "\" Pa sang out."
- |
  

- "\"Caroline, this is our neighbor, Mr. Edwards."
- |
  

- I met him yesterday down at the creek.
- |
  

- Mr. Edwards is a wildcat mortgage broker from Tennessee.
- |
  

- He is going to finance our house for us!
- "\"I am pleased to meet you, ma'am,\""
- |
  

- Mr. Edwards said, bowing.
- |
  

- "\"And I'm tickled to be able to offer you and your husband the finest 5/1 negative-amortization loan this side of the Mississippi!"
- "\"Tell us more,\""
- |
  

- Pa encouraged him.
- "\"Well, now, your teaser rate is only 1.5 percent!"
- "\" Mr. Edwards went on, pausing to spit tobacco juice into his hip pocket."
- |
  

- "\"Don't that beat all?"
- "\"It sounds wonderful,\""
- |
  

- Ma said politely in her gentle voice.
- |
  

- "\"And what will our rate be after the introductory period, Mr. Edwards?"
- "\"That depends on those scoundrels in Washington!"
- "\" Mr. Edwards declared hotly."
- "\"Pa, how much will we pay for the house?"
- "\" Mary asked."
- "\"What we pay doesn't matter much, Mary,\""
- |
  

- Pa explained.
- |
  

- "\"At 1.5 percent interest, we can easily service the debt on the principal."
- Laura was confused.
- |
  

- "\"But when do we pay off the principal, Pa?"
- "\" she asked."
- "\"She's got you there, Edwards!"
- "\" Pa laughed."
- |
  

- "\"What about that principal?"
- "\"Those are two mighty smart daughters you have there, Ingalls,\""
- |
  

- Mr. Edwards said admiringly.
- |
  

- "\"Well, it's pretty simple."
- |
  

- Your loan will reamortize every 60 months.
- |
  

- The minimum payment will be recalculated at that time, but your rate will vary annually according to the then-current prime lending rate.
- |
  

- "Of course, your regular rate and payment resets will continue to apply, but these will be capped at\x97 Look!"
- |
  

- A jackrabbit!
- "\"Good game surely is plentiful in this country,\""
- |
  

- Pa observed.
- "\"You've said it, Ingalls!"
- "\" Mr. Edwards agreed."
- |
  

- "\"And once all the   Indians are gone this land will be worth millions!"
- "\"That's true enough, Edwards,\""
- |
  

- Pa.
- |
  

- "\"But you are taking the short view."
- |
  

- I'm minded to give mortgages to all the Indians, and sell them more houses.
- Mr. Edwards whooped and threw his coonskin cap high in the air.
- |
  

- "\"Now, that's the kind of thinking that made this country great!"
- "\" he shouted."
- |
  

- "\"Why, we can issue mortgage-backed securities with a weighted-average-gross coupon of 9 or 10 percent!"
- "\"We'll live like kings!"
- "\" Pa exclaimed."
- "\"Ingalls, you're the brokerin'est fool that ever I did see!"
- "\" Mr. Edwards told him, spitting into his mule's ear."
- Pa and Ma signed the papers.
- Laura still didn't understand.
- |
  

- "\"But, Pa,\""
- |
  

- "\"if we never pay off any of the principal, how will we build equity in the house?"
- "\"Don't worry, Laura,\""
- |
  

- Pa reassured her.
- |
  

- "\"In a year, this house will be worth twice what we paid for it."
- |
  

- And if we need cash before then I can always hew some equity out of an oak stump with my ax.
- |
  

- Oak is good hard wood.
- Then Laura felt better.
- |
  

- Pa could make anything with his ax.
- "\"You see, Laura,\""
- |
  

- Pa went on, "Uncle Sam has made a bet with us.
- |
  

- We have bet that housing prices will continue to rise at historic rates for the foreseeable future.
- |
  

- And the government has bet that if real-estate values plummet, honest citizens like us will be too stupid to do anything but continue paying out our hard-earned 5-cent pieces for property that was never worth more than a fraction of its appraised value.
- |
  

- Either way, we are going to win that bet!
- "\"Charles,\""
- |
  

- Ma remonstrated.
- |
  

- She did not approve of gambling, even in   metaphors.
- "\"But what if land values  do  drop?"
- "\" Laura wanted to know."
- Pa's blue eyes twinkled.
- |
  

- "\"That can never happen, Half-Pint."
- |
  

- Why, it's just as likely that all our crops will be ruined by a blizzard, or a prairie fire, or a horde of grasshoppers!
- Laura and Mary and Ma and Pa all laughed at that idea.
- |
  

- Jack barked and barked.
- |
  

- Mr. Edwards ran around his mule in circles, slapping at imaginary bees.
- "\"And I'll tell you what else, Caroline,\""
- |
  

- Pa added.
- |
  

- "\"As soon as the house is built and the oats are planted, I will drive the wagon to  Independence and bring back some granite countertops for your kitchen."
- Laura and Mary hugged each other at the thought of a house with boughten countertops!
- "\"Oh, Charles!"
- "\" Ma protested."
- |
  

- "\"Store-boughten countertops!"
- |
  

- But Independence is 40 miles away!
- "\"Pshaw, nothing's too good for you, Caroline,\""
- |
  

- Pa told her.
- |
  

- "\"Besides, I can put it on the credit card."
- "\"Well,\""
- |
  

- Ma admitted, "it will be nice to live like civilized folks again.
