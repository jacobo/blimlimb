- "Q: After getting attacked by a great white, how did you eventually go back to diving?"
- "Fox: After I was attacked, I went off power-heading sharks with an explosive head underwater."
- |
  

- A power-head is an explosive device that fits usually on the end of the spear and has a bullet for the charge.
- |
  

- I thought, if I could convince myself that this is a weapon I'm proud of or I can use, I won't be so scared in the water.
- |
  

- But we couldn't find any sharks.
- |
  

- Then I spoke to several shark victims &#151; there aren't that many around &#151; and they hadn't seen the shark coming.
- |
  

- It doesn't matter how big a gun you've got, or how good it is, if you don't see it coming, if it sneaks up on you, you can't deal with it.
- |
  

- So I looked for other ways to look for sharks and to get my confidence back.
- "Q: Like what?"
- "Fox: I actually became an abalone diver, a full-time diver in the same waters here, and I worked there for sixteen years."
- |
  

- I was one of the first ones in South Australia.
- |
  

- I made my living around these islands, where we still went out with film crews and found sharks.
- |
  

- In over five to six thousand hours underwater, in my diving career, I only saw three great white sharks when I was taking abalone.
- |
  

- I have no doubt that more great whites saw me, because your head's down and your bottom is up.
- |
  

- They weren't interested in the abalone or us as a scuba diver, and yet I saw hundreds when you just put a bit more fish juice and blood in the water.
- "Q: You never got attacked after that first time?"
- "Fox: In the early days of power-heading sharks, my friend speared a big fish."
- |
  

- All these damn bull sharks came racing in, and we power-headed them off.
- |
  

- We drifted well away from shore, and it was a long way back to the boat.
- |
  

- I had only one bullet left.
- |
  

- "\"Save the last bullet for yourself,\""
- |
  

- I was thinking.
- |
  

- I think I'd seen some crazy cowboy film.
- |
  

- Then this big tiger shark comes straight out of the sun toward me and I thought, "Bugger that!
- "\" And I went, \""
- Boom!
- "Q: How'd you end up in the business of filming great white sharks?"
- "Fox: My shark attack dragged me into this business."
- |
  

- The main reason was because everybody in the hospital didn't talk about sharks.
- |
  

- They said I'd be a good golfer and everything else, but they didn't talk about sharks.
- |
  

- Alf Dean is the world record holder &#151; he's dead now &#151; for game fishing on great white sharks.
- |
  

- In South Australia, he held four of the five records for great white sharks over one ton.
- |
  

- "He wrote to me in hospital: \"Rodney Fox, Shark Victim, Royal Adelaide Hospital."
- "\" He said he thinks it was a great white shark of about eleven feet long and that I was really lucky that time."
- |
  

- If I'd seen what he's seen I'd never go back in the water again.
- "Q: When was this?"
- "Fox: In the 1960's."
- |
  

- They were just beginning to explore the seas.
- |
  

- Masks and fins and scuba had just been invented.
- |
  

- We were sticking our heads under places people had never seen before.
- |
  

- And I knew the world was made up of seven-tenths water, and I wanted to go back in, but of course I was pretty scared after the attack.
- |
  

- And so I organized the first expedition to see what he [Alf Dean] meant, and have a look at my attacker.
- "Q: You just dived right in, so to speak?"
- "Fox: [Points to picture of shark cage."
- |
  

- This particular cage is the first one I ever built.
- |
  

- Three shark victims went out to spear, to look at sharks, catch them, kill them and film them underwater.
- |
  

- That was in 1965.
- |
  

- We made the first underwater film of great white sharks, with underwater cameras.
- "Q: You do these films for educational purposes, even after you almost got eaten?"
- "Fox: They're probably many things in the world that need help, but because of my shark attack and the number of people who ask me strange questions &#151; that's what I've focused on now for nearly forty years."
- Science has proven we need the shark &#151; they're not very many, they don't have many young.
- |
  

- They're at the top of the food chain.
- |
  

- The food that they eat is the slowest, the weak, the sick, the ones with viruses.
- |
  

- Something underwater we can't do, so we should protect and look after them.
- |
  

- It's been a hard thing to keep that straight without getting emotional.
- "Q: Can you describe that time you were attacked?"
- "Fox: I dived down and I was gliding along and I was just going to spear a big fish."
- |
  

- I knew I had it, I was so close, and its head was in the weed, and I couldn't see it.
- |
  

- As I was about to shoot it, this huge thump hit me in the chest so hard that immediately I thought it was a train, and then I thought, "No I'm underwater.
- "\" It was such a big thump, and it knocked the gun out of my hand, the mask off my face, and I was just hurled through the water faster than I could swim."
- "Q: Wow."
- "Fox: I thought, \"What can I do to get out of its mouth?"
- "\" Its eyes were probably the most vulnerable thing."
- |
  

- My arms were over the top of it, so I gouged its head, and it seemed to stop.
- |
  

- I thrust my hand out instinctively to push it away and my hand went over its teeth in its mouth.
- |
  

- I quickly dragged it out before it could close its mouth, but I lifted it and &#151;  rrip &#151; I ended up with ninety-seven stitches.
- "Q: Just in your hand?"
- "Fox: I had ninety-seven stitches in that hand and four tendons cut, so I couldn't use that hand anymore."
- |
  

- I thought I'd grab the shark in a bear hug around its belly so it couldn't bite me.
- |
  

- I grabbed it around the belly and I held on, but I'm snorkeling and I'm still forty feet underwater holding my breath.
- "Q: I thought you were scuba diving."
- "Fox: I'm out of breath and my chest is bleeding."
- |
  

- And so I thought, "I'm going to drown.
- "\" So I pushed off, went to the surface, took a big breath of air and I looked down."
- |
  

- And the memory I have, this memory of looking down through the blood red water, which is my blood, and this great big head coming up with its mouth wide open &#151; is the scariest one in my whole memory, because I had nothing to protect myself with.
- |
  

- I thought, "
- What can I do, What can I do?
- "\" And I kicked at the head as hard as I could as it came up to bite me, its mouth wide open."
- |
  

- I kicked at it, thinking that's the only thing I've got.
- |
  

- But everything underwater is twenty-percent further away, and so I just touched it with the fin, and not smashed it as I expected to.
- "Q: This doesn't get better, does it?"
- "Fox: Then it swam up and swallowed the fish float I was towing behind me, a buoy, with a piece of wire with two small fish, because I'd weighed in most of them and I was on my way up."
- |
  

- It swallowed that whole and did a circle, tightened the rope to my belt &#151; it must've thought something was wrong, and it took off.
- As it swam down it towed me down and I'm spinning, spinning, spinning.
- |
  

- So with my left hand &#151; my brain knew that my right hand wasn't working, and I ran my fingers over the lead weights trying to find the quick release and I couldn't find it.
- |
  

- I'm just about to gasp water, and the line snapped!
- |
  

- The shark had actually bitten the line three-quarters the way through when it had bitten me the first time.
- |
  

- Laughs].
- I couldn't work out which way was up, and I remember as a leaf drops from a tree I remember just leafing up to the surface.
- |
  

- When I got there I took a couple of breaths and yelled out, "Shark!
- |
  

- Shark!
- "\" But it was an absolute miracle because we never had boats in these [spear-fishing] competitions."
- |
  

- We're all too poor.
- |
  

- We just went off the shore and back again.
- |
  

- Somebody had brought a boat down.
- |
  

- They'd seen all this bright red water and came over to have a look, and I came up in the middle of it.
- |
  

- They rolled me into the boat before the shark came back and raced me to shore.
- "Q: This is going to sound stupid, but did it hurt?"
- "Fox: The fear of dying and the fear of having to fight for your life overcomes pain as we know it."
- |
  

- But it's a worse pain, the fear of dying.
- |
  

- That you're in really big trouble is something equal to pain.
- |
  

- When I was in the boat and they picked up another guy and were racing to shore, I felt waves of pain that continued on for many, many, many days after that.
- |
  

- But you know, it never occurred to me to give up, even though my lung had collapsed.
- |
  

- I was trying to breathe through my right lung &#151; [makes chortling sound] &#151; and it was so hard.
- |
  

- I hardly had any blood left, and I was weak, it was just &#151; I just kept trying.
- "Q: What did they do at the hospital?"
- "Fox: They had no idea at first about what to do and how to do it."
- |
  

- There was so much morphine.
- |
  

- I went on these incredible Mardi Gras marches &#151; the colors I saw!
- |
  

- Now that the drug scene is in and people have told me that they see these incredible colors I understand it, because I'd never really taken drugs until then.
- |
  

- I thought the colors were so incredible, that if I could only remember them and reproduce them I'd make a fortune.
- "Q: Did you know it was a great white that had attacked you?"
- "Fox: I didn't know what it was at the time."
- |
  

- We didn't know much about sharks in those days.
- |
  

- I couldn't have named three or four sharks in those days.
- |
  

- Sharks were sharks.
- |
  

- It's like saying, Religion or Death, or Hell or Fear.
- |
  

- It was just a shark.
- |
  

- I knew bronze whalers, we had a few swim around us, and a few of the little ones, but this was the King Terror himself.
- |
  

- It was quite an introduction!
- "Q: Do you ever have nightmares about it?"
- "Fox: I tried to sleep to disappear, because of the pain."
- |
  

- I remember laying in the hospital, panting, just a little bit, because every time I fell asleep I imagined stretching my lungs, the crunch and creak, and all those bones and everything.
- |
  

- I was strong enough to wake up during a dream and stop it.
- |
  

- I'd think of other things.
- |
  

- Like food, and what I'd do.
- |
  

- But the only thing that was really strong enough was boobs &#151; girls' boobs, and sex and stuff like that.
- |
  

- You can think about pretty flowers and cars or Ferraris.
- |
  

- None of that was strong enough.
- |
  

- I don't know if you should print it up quite that way.
