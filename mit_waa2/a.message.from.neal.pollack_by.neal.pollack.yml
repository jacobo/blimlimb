  Every reading on my book-tour schedule is real. They have all happened, and will all continue to happen, with the exception of the songwriting workshop at Wrigley Field, which I am removing from the schedule due to previously unplanned domestic obligations. People have come to these readings, and enjoyed themselves. Let me provide a brief but amusing summary.
  Sept. 6, Fenway Park ticket window, Boston:  Approximately ten people in attendance, including reporter and photographer from Boston Phoenix and Peter from Lancaster, PA, who was in town for a job interview. Read "One Writer's Routine" and "The Albania of My Existence." Answered questions. Did imitations of Bill Buckner and Carlton Fisk. Sold four books out of backpack.
  Sept. 10, Ellis Island, New York City:   Six people made it onto the 3:30 ferry, which was the last of the day. These included Karl Tobais Steel, a medievalist from Columbia University; May, who works for the ACLU; Mary, who is "floundering;" Mike, who doesn't like to laugh; and Elizabeth, who has made the unfortunate choice of working as a theater techie. Read from "Leaves of Grass." Read "Secrets of the Mystery Jew." Read from Karl's Old-English-language version of "Beowulf." Went on tour of museum. It was Jenny Lind Day, and we met a Jenny Lind impersonator, who asked us if we were from Israel. We said we were not. She then led us in a chorus of "Oseh Shalom Bimromav," as we linked arms. Sold three books. My friend Debbie, who was in attendance, later looked up a web URL that Jenny Lind had given us. Turned out that Jenny Lind is a Jew for Jesus.
  Sept. 11, Coney Island, New York City: 	Met at aquarium at 2:30. In attendance were Courtney, Amy, and Neal (no relation), all sociology graduate students, and Robin, who is in journalism graduate school at Columbia and is covering Brighton Beach. Ian Lendler and Jason Eaton rounded out the crew; they are hopeful young humor writers whose website, Freedonian.com, should be going up within a week, and will be quite good. Read "My Week At Sea" in dolphin stadium. Announcer from dolphin show interrupted me on purpose. Saw dolphin show, which included a sea lion named Fonzie. Attended penguin and otter feedings and asked intelligent questions, particularly Ian. Went to seahorse exhibit. Courtney, who was grumpy, left early.

Unsuccessfully tried to trade book for T-shirt at Freak Show gift shop. Rode carousel. Read "Portrait of an Andalusian Horse Trainer" in front of carousel. Rode subway home.
  Sept. 12, 30th Street Train Station, Philadelphia: 	Intern Laurence and I arrived 45 minutes in advance of reading and met friend Jen Rehill, from WHYY radio. Ate delicious buttered pretzels. Peter from Lancaster showed up again. I asked him why he didn't come to normal readings. He had no good excuse. Three women in black mini-dresses and bright orange wigs appeared.
