- For five years, I've begged you to watch the best show on television, but you didn't listen.
- |
  

- That's why I've kidnapped you, my closest friends and family members, and locked you here inside my apartment.
- |
  

- I know how tired you all are of me telling you about  The Wire 's deliciously complex plotlines, its unflinching sociological commentary, and its note-perfect gallows humor.
- |
  

- Well, I'm tired, too.
- And so here we are.
- "Check the top of the TV for the DVDs of the first four seasons\x97over 40 hours of television."
- |
  

- When you're done with those, the fifth and final season is available via OnDemand.
- |
  

- Just hit the red button on the remote.
- |
  

- "Sounds daunting, but don't worry: I've removed any and all possible distractions from the apartment."
- |
  

- You have no other options, so don't try any of your usual excuses.
- You feel me?
- Be sure to watch every episode carefully.
- |
  

- It's all connected!
- |
  

- On the coffee table, you'll see multiple-choice tests that assess your grasp of the show's plot and characters.
- |
  

- Finish them as you complete each season, and then slip them under the door.
- |
  

- A score of 80 percent or higher and you'll be rewarded with a day's ration of food and water.
- |
  

- Score below that and, well, I've hired some muscle from down on the corner to "help out" should you need further motivation.
- But you're all going to pass.
- |
  

- I know it.
- Please understand that holding the dearest people in my life hostage is not something I take lightly.
- |
  

- It's risky, expensive, and technically illegal, but sometimes you have to listen to your inner McNulty and take justice into your own hands.
- Besides, the show is so fucking good.
- |
  

- It's  all  connected!
- |
  

- I've told you this day after day, year after year, and you all ignored it, preferring to watch  American Idol  and  Wife Swap .
- |
  

- I mean, Jesus Christ.
- |
  

- Wife Swap ?
- I realize, Mom, this isn't the best timing, what with your chemo and everything.
- |
  

- And, Jim, buddy, your absence from work is going to be hard to explain to your firm.
- |
  

- But what choice do I have?
- |
  

- How can I stand by and allow you to miss the conclusion of the smartest, most resonant drama in the history of television?
- |
  

- So, yeah, Jim, maybe you'll get fired.
- |
  

- And, Mom, it's possible that tumor of yours will make a reappearance.
- |
  

- But it's a small price to pay.
- Just trust me on this one.
- |
  

- When it's over, you'll thank me.
- |
  

- For real, yo.
