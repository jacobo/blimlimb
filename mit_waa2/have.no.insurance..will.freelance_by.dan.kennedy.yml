- Chris Whitley at The Knitting Factory.
- Mr. Whitley is no stranger to knocking at the door of major label success, or the bittersweet battle that every artist has to fight when courting the larger audience that comes with radio airplay and having a video in rotation on MTV.

- Seeing Whitley in a smaller venue far away from his recent festival appearances was a welcome opportunity for this fan.
- |
  

- I can't recall what song Mr. Whitley opened the show with, because the dull pain in my groin was finally accompanied by a new symptom that had me convinced what I thought might be a minor lifting or stretching injury may in fact be a serious problem with my blood circulation.
- |
  

- "You guessed it: a narrowing field of vision has augmented my concern about the groin situation."
- |
  

- I believe the first song of the evening was "Narcotic Prayer," from the Din of Ecstasy record that first brought Whitley to the attention of the major labels in the mid-nineties. And just hearing the word "narcotic" made me ponder what the prescriptions alone would cost me if, in fact, there was something keeping my heart from moving blood through my muscle tissue.

- A great show from Chris Whitley, as far as I can recall.
- |
  

- Memory's kind of going these days, what with the week-long migraines and the periodic blackouts.
