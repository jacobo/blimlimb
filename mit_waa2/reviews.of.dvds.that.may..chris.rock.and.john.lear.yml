- Fourteen minutes into the movie, just as Billy Bob was getting into a fistfight at the beach bar, the screen disintegrated into very large squares of color, then the disc stopped completely.

- "We took the disc back to the DVD Caf\xE9 and the woman refused to honor her stated policy, offering us instead DVDs of  Badder Santa  and  Without a Paddle ."

- After protracted negotiations, we settled on  Badder Santa  and a pair of fake Nike socks.
- Sin City
- "Obtained: Guy standing on Maoming Road, next to guy selling puppies"
- "Price: 8 RMB"
- In several climactic scenes, including the Jessica Alba dancing segments, the anvil-headed guy in front of the cameraman gets up to go to the bathroom.
- |
  

- His big flat head blots out a good 10 percent of the screen.
- |
  

- Damn you and your excitement-sensitive bladder, anvil-headed guy.
- |
  

- We're looking for you.
- |
  

- We'd recognize that jug anywhere.
- Ten minutes in, the DVD starts skipping.
- |
  

- Repeated cleanings with bottom of T-shirt fail to improve performance.
- |
  

- It plays normally again at the 21-minute mark, leaving us confused about where the Bruce Willis character went.

- After the movie is over, we're still not sure.
- Film also ends with credits from  Shredder .
