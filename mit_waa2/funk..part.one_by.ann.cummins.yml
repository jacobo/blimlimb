- When the doctor stuck his flashlight in Rivard's ear, Rivard reeled back and said, "Now hold on there.
- "\"Well, it's infected, I can tell you that."
- "\" And on further examination, \""
- You got a hole in the membrane.
- "\"A hole in the membrane,\""
- |
  

- Rivard said.
- "\"What you been doing, son, to pop a membrane like that?"
- The doctor's wall was perfectly blank.
- |
  

- No nature scenes, no happy faces.
- |
  

- Rivard stared into the blank wall and tried to hold on to his good mood.
- |
  

- "\"I'm a musician."
- "\"Music,\""
- |
  

- "\"Well, I'll be honest with you."
- |
  

- I've known certain illegal substances to eat a man's ear away like this.
- "\" He clicked the flashlight off and peered over his glasses into Rivard's eyes."
- |
  

- "\"Worst case scenarios, they can erode your tympanic membrane."
- |
  

- You ever use those kind of drugs?
- "Rivard dead-eyed the dough-faced gentleman, and spelled it out again: \"In my spare time,\" he said, \"I play a little music."
- The doctor straightened up, tucked his flashlight in his pocket, and shrugged.
- |
  

- "\"I guess if you end up deaf, you'll be ready to hear what I'm talking about."
- As soon as he could, Rivard got out of there, but it was too late.
- |
  

- The man had fouled his good mood.
- People were always on him about something.
- |
  

- People on his case all the time.
- |
  

- The doc'd put drops in Rivard's ear and stuffed it with cotton.
- |
  

- Now, Rivard took the cotton out and smelled it.
- |
  

- Smelled like cotton.
- |
  

- He thought about Dr. Shrewd and his pugnacious eyes, his fat-fingered hands, and the drops Rivard hadn't felt.
- |
  

- He tossed the cotton in the gutter.
- |
  

- His ear hurt.
- |
  

- He needed to clean it out.
- |
  

- In the apartment the dishes were all on the floor.
- |
  

- Dishtowels were on the floor.
- |
  

- Coffee pot, toaster, bread, butter &#8212; all on the floor.
- |
  

- Rivard's girlfriend, Betty, was on the floor, too, sprawled out in front of the TV, her feet swathed in gauze.
- |
  

- Betty'd had bone spurs removed a week ago, and now she couldn't walk.
- |
  

- She scooted around on her rump and spent days in front of the TV.
- |
  

- Rivard spent days putting things within her reach.
- Now she sat blinking up at him.
- |
  

- "\"What'd the doctor say?"
- She'd wanted the microwave on the floor, but he drew the line there.
- "\"Is it infected?"
- On TV, a man in a chef's hat was dicing carrots.
- |
  

- This struck Rivard funny.
- |
  

- "\"What are you watching?"
- "\"Gourmet Chef."
- "\"Why you watching that?"
- "\"I might just cook us something."
- "\" Rivard laughed."
- |
  

- "\"I might,\""
- |
  

- "\"What?"
- "\"What are you doing here?"
- She shut her mouth.
- "\"Did I invite you?"
- She looked back at the TV.
- Rivard stared at the side of her face.
- |
  

- For three months Betty O'Dell had been here, day in, day out, and for one week, ever since she had the bone spurs removed, he'd been her personal man-servant.
- |
  

- Just now it made him mad.
- He stepped over her sprawled legs, headed for the bathroom, and shut the door.
- |
  

- He stood in front of the mirror and peered sideways into his crusted ear.
- |
  

- When he was a boy, he had swimmer's ear.
- |
  

- His mother had poured hydrogen peroxide in it, and it opened up just like that.
- |
  

- His mother was dead now, and he didn't have anybody to call about something like this, nor about his high blood pressure.
- |
  

- He had high blood pressure, his blood sugar was way out of whack, and now this.
- He seriously doubted that the doctor had put drops in his ear.
- |
  

- "Dr. Cool: The type who'd like to teach somebody a lesson."
- |
  

- A situation.
- |
  

- That's what he had.
- |
  

- Rivard had run into situations before.
- |
  

- He'd once had the house band at a downtown club.
- |
  

- The environment got a little stale so Rivard served notice.
- |
  

- The club owner, Jack was his name, had a temper about it, and on the last night wouldn't pay them.
- |
  

- "\"So sue me."
- "\" That's what Jack had said."
- It was a situation, and this thing with Dr. Medical Moral Majority was a situation, too.
- |
  

- Rivard had seen 'em all.
- |
  

- He'd had songs stolen, players wooed.
- |
  

- Once on a road trip he'd been hung out to dry.
- |
  

- Tibur, South Carolina.
- |
  

- Woke the last day of the tour, found manager and money gone.
- |
  

- Had to hock his drums to get bus fare home.
- "The manager, old Jack, Dr. Thinks-He's-Smart: Guys like that liked knowing they could make a man crawl."
- |
  

- "One thing Rivard knew for sure: you only had yourself to rely on."
- |
