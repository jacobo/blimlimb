- A short, thin man who held his head at a sharp angle, he allowed other men to rent him out for $5 a day.

- They'd grip him around his thin shanks, swing him over their heads, and bash golf balls around with his dented, grass-stained skull.

- He didn't mind their sweaty hands on him, or their blaming him when their shots went bad, or the hours spent in a confining bag with other clubs.

- He'd talk to his fellow clubs, the woods and irons both, about getting out of the bag and getting a better job one day.

- But that old stick loved the game&#8212;the outdoors, the cart travel, the sand and mud in his face, the being tossed in the water hazard on occasion, and even being left out overnight on a fairway by a forgetful player.

- He didn't retire until age 65, his spine bent and his grip unraveled.

- Sam, the stylish young graphite club who replaced him, said there'd never be 9-irons like Daddy ever again on our links.

- Sam liked to tell how, one day on the 17th green, Tiger Woods used Daddy to chip into the hole for a birdie.

- Sam was lying, of course, since Tiger has his own 9-iron, one much nicer than Daddy.

- But it shows how we all felt about Daddy.

- Later, Daddy took up fishing, becoming his own pole.

- The day he drowned&#8212;yanked into the drainage basin by a half-pound bluegill&#8212;was sunny, with small wads of cumulus clouds in the sky.
