- A swain who worked near the Euphrates
- "Had quite a smooth way with the ladies:"
- When he tried for a kiss,
- He would not ever miss,
- So I had him lowered into an acid bath until his screams woke the dead.
- |
  

- A Baath Party bureaucrat thought
- He'd defy me and never get caught.
- Imagine his shock
- When, called in to talk,
- He was thrown from the 12th-story window of the interrogation office.

- One Abdul Ghani Shindala
- Was especially good, a cappella,
- At singing the praises
- Of foes and disgraces,
- So I had the traitorous cur assassinated after he fled the country.
- |
  

- A comely young lady from Nippur
- Was always quite friendly and chipper.
- It's a shame to relate,
- "But her fianc\xE9's fate"
- Was to contribute to the labyrinth of bones beneath my torture stadium.
- |
  

- A Samarra cleric persisted
- In the praising of persons blacklisted.
- I was left little choice
- But to limit his voice
- By feeding his extracted tongue to birds of carrion.
