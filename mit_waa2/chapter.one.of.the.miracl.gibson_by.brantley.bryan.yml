- People like you come to Chiba; they don't come out.

- Or maybe they do, but they come out different.

- Annie had noticed the shotgun, a boxy Garin Riot-Burst model, hidden behind some boxes of gauzeplast, but there was no way the spidery, gray-haired street doc could get to it.

- You work out here like a street cutter, but you can do things nobody else can.

  "What are you doing here, Sullivan? People like you come to Chiba; they don't come out. Or maybe they do, but they come out different. Dead."
  Hojima's threat was back-alley standard, all flash. Annie had noticed the shotgun, a boxy Garin Riot-Burst model, hidden behind some boxes of gauzeplast, but there was no way the spidery, gray-haired street doc could get to it. Not before Annie could take out her taser, at least. Months in the Perkins Corporation's security-training holo made
  sure of that.
  "You stand to profit from this. No reason for you to go shifty." She spoke without emotion, her eyes covered by her mirrorshades.
  "Talk, then."
  "I know what you did back in the war. I know about Aegis Battalion. The grafting. The black-ops med work. You work out here like a street cutter, but you can do things nobody else can. I've got something for you."
  "What?"
