  I am pleased to share the results from new studies we've recently completed at the J.D. Aspen Institute that prove conclusively the Chimpy Corollary to the Motherfucker Hypothesis. This corollary claims that \"almost all people are at least mildly offended when you address them as Chimpy, yet they often don't know why\" and that their level of agitation is \"similar regardless of race, religion, nationality, or gender.\"\n\
  The majority of our study was conducted in the real world, addressing workers in various service industries, friends, and family. When uttered, the phrases were held at a constant, unexcited pitch and offered to a myriad of participants who were subsequently asked to respond to a questionnaire regarding the experience.\n\
  Examples of statements used in this study include:\n\
  \"Hold on, Chimpy, I had fries with that.\"\n\
  \"Is there a problem, Officer Chimpy?\"\n\
  \"Whoa there, Chimpy, I gave you a twenty.\"\n\
  \"Could you pass the wine, Chimpy?\"\n\
  \"Look, Chimpy, a Q-tip is not a weapon I could use to hijack the plane, though I will acknowledge your point that they do sort of resemble 'fuzzy matches.'\"\n\
  The results were not markedly affected by adding titles (e.g., \"Dr. Chimpy,\" \"Rabbi Chimpy,\" \"Chef Chimpy,\" etc.), applying the diminutive (\"Little Miss Chimpy,\" \"Chimpito,\" \"Chimpchen,\" etc.), or by applying other endings (\"Chimpson,\" \"Mr. Chimpypants,\" etc.) to the root word \"Chimp(y).\"\n\
  While participants could not always articulate why they were offended, 99.6 percent reported that they were, in fact, offended and consistently described the feeling as \"miffed\" and \"slightly put out.\" After excluding the data from one unoffended Frenchman whose last name was Chimpet, this number rose to a perfect 100 percent!\n\
  So you are asking yourself, \"Where are we breaking new ground? How does this deviate from the Motherfucker Hypothesis? Why do we need a corollary?\"\n\
