- A DISPATCH BY  PETE BRUSH
- |
  

- NEW YORK, NEW YORK&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;My friend David Tengelin, a Swedish kid, got lost somewhere in the collapsed north tower.
- |
  

- David was an accountant with Marsh, one of the hardest-hit firms.
- |
  

- He was twenty-five and worked on the 101st Floor, near where the first plane hit.
- |
  

- David and I were relative newcomers to a team that plays soccer together on Tuesday nights in a city league called UrbanSoccer.
- |
  

- Our team called him Toe Poke, because of his notorious method for goal-scoring.
- |
  

- His friends from Arizona, where he went to college, called him Swede.
- His death brought many people together.
- |
  

- We told each other, based on the sad forensics of watching television, that it was likely he didn't suffer.
- |
  

- I still find myself fantasizing that David's down in the basement of the World Trade Center, in the shopping mall, eating Almond Joys with a pretty secretary and waiting for the cops to show up.
- Last week, another teammate, and fellow journalist at CBS News, Dean Cox, and I set out to tour the area around ground zero.
- |
  

- Dean had visited earlier, and wanted to return.
- |
  

- I intended to report on the plight&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;or success&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;of local businesses, among other things, for the website I work for.
- |
  

- We also just wanted to know how things were going down there.
- |
  

- But our walk, which lasted several hours, was really defined by David's disappearance.
- |
  

- Every movement and conversation took place in the shadow of loss.
- Working just blocks from where it seems David may lie forever, buried if not laid to rest, there is a young Senegalese man, Souleymane Dieng, who lost his job at a Chambers Street Blimpie sandwich shop because it was too near ground zero.
- |
  

- Blimpie didn't provide Souleymane with a golden parachute.
- |
  

- Within two days of the attacks, Souleymane, who's twenty-three and lives in Brooklyn, visited a distributor of patriotic flags, pins and T-shirts on 28th Street, and purchased several boxes of lapel pins, including the stars and stripes; "America Fights Back"; and the familiar red, white and blue ribbon. Now he's selling them out of a cardboard box on the corner of Broadway and Chambers.
- Souleymane is tall and lanky, the same build as David.
- |
  

- The two could be cousins.
- |
  

- I could see David, famous among friends for his wily ways on the soccer field, adapting as Souleymane has.
- |
  

- My friends and I are reluctant to give up hope about David, though I tell them&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and they tell me&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;that such a sentiment is, at this point, little more than a caveat.
- Two blocks to the west, at the corner of Chambers and Greenwich Streets, a mobile McDonald's has been humming day and night, slinging free Quarter-Pounders and Chicken McNuggets&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;along with sodas and coffee&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;for the hard-hat workers, cops, fireman, EMTs, ASPCAs, and soldiers.
- |
  

- McDonald's workers from local franchises come in and take shifts.
- |
  

- They are proud and energetic.
- Last year, anti-globalization protesters, people in whose eyes the Golden Arches represent much that is wrong with the modern world, trashed David's hometown of Gvteborg, Sweden.
- |
  

- He was furious.
- |
  

- Now, here was McDonald's, strangely comforting, keeping the troops fed.
- |
  

- Anybody could see it was a good thing.
- McDonald's is here because it can afford to be generous.
- |
  

- Cheryl O. Forsatz, who works PR for the company, says the mobile McDonald's has given away 15,000 burgers and just as many Chicken McNuggets each day.
- |
  

- Nearby, tiny delis and pizza places are struggling to reopen, and their owners are worried about the future.
- |
  

- The little guy vs.
- |
  

- "\"I'm scared,\""
- |
  

- Joey Scalici, 24, of Joey's Pizza nearby.
- |
  

- "\"Hopefully in a couple of months we'll get it going."
- "\" Joey's face is beaded with sweat; he's been making pizza all day."
- |
  

- He comes in from New Jersey early in the morning, despite the slow business.
- |
  

- He's determined to stay in the game until things return to normal.
- |
  

- "He figures: I come in, act normal."
- |
  

- So will they.
- |
  

- Mom-and-pop shops in the World Trade Center area have mortgaged into very expensive real estate.
- |
  

- But Scalici knows that, even when the clean-up is complete, the huge infusion of foot traffic the World Trade buildings were responsible for each day at lunchtime will not be coming back for a long time.
- |
  

- My friends and I said goodbye to David Tengelin last Saturday, in a small Swedish Lutheran house of worship near Gramercy Park.
- |
  

- His parents, sister, and brother got on a plane and flew here from Gvteborg, showing more courage than I believe I could muster.
- |
  

- The hardest part of the ceremony was watching his family cry and knowing I couldn't do anything.
- As of September 30, the State Department listed David as the only missing Swede.
- David's father, Peter, unshakable in his faith, and without tears, told us he was sure he would see David again.
- |
  

- Many of David's soccer mates, hearing David's father, broke down into tears.
- |
  

- Peter's five minutes of grieved stoicism were more powerful than any hymn or prayer we heard in the church.
- The following Tuesday night, our team, the D. Boon All-Stars, named after the late singer from the Minutemen, lost 4-2, in a match on a rooftop at West Side Highway and Houston Streets.
- |
  

- The soccer pitch overlooks what's left of the World Trade Center.
- |
  

- Not only did we lose, we didn't play all that well either.
- |
  

- David, I'm sure, would have been unhappy with the loss.
- |
  

- Last year, when he sprained his ankle in a game and couldn't play the next week, I remember he came out anyway, just to cheer us on.
