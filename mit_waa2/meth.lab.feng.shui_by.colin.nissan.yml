- Place Yourself in the Power Position
- Make sure your chair is facing the front door.

- Working with your back to the front door places you in the path of negative energy and makes you the first one to get cuffed during a raid.

- One of many instances where the principles of feng shui, meth making, and common sense collide.
- Clear the Clutter
- When you clear clutter, you clear your mind.
- |
  

- For example, once you remove the lithium from your batteries and finish stirring it into the pitcher of ammonia, throw out the battery shells.

- Eliminate the flow-choking mess and the risk of chemical burns in one practical step.

- Same goes for lab glassware and rubber tubing.

- Who wants to start out a 14-hour meth-making session by doing dishes?
- Enhance Your Prosperity Corner
- As you enter a room, the area to the far left is considered your wealth and prosperity corner.

- It's advisable to put something valuable and water-related here.
- |
  

- An aquarium stocked with brightly colored carp is a good choice.
- |
  

- "One word of caution: you may, on occasion, wake up after a particularly blinding meth-smoking session and find remnants of a fried-carp sandwich all over your shirt."
- Create a Nourishing View
- Chances are you're covering up your windows so people can't see you making meth.
- |
  

- Though completely understandable, this is a giant feng-shui no-no, and all the more reason why you need to keep your lab balanced and flowing.
- |
  

- Think about what you see when you look up from your worktable.
- |
  

- If it's a wall or a blackout curtain, maybe it's not just withdrawals that are making you feel antsy and depressed.
- |
  

- This is the perfect opportunity to hang up some artwork, like of dogs playing poker.
- Balance Your Senses
- Phosphine gas is a byproduct of the meth-cooking process and is highly lethal to inhale.
- |
  

- Lethal smells are so not feng shui.
- |
  

- A good idea is to counterbalance a lethal odor with a delicious one, like that of a Mango Splash Glade PlugIn.
- Plants are a key feng-shui component for their unique ability to absorb energy-stifling toxins from the air.
- |
  

- Unfortunately, your average fern probably won't stand up to the piercing wafts of hydrogen chloride, so consider something hardier, like a fake fern.
- Don't disregard the aural energy in your lab.
- |
  

- Drown out persistent drones from the propane tank with a nice ocean-wave relaxation CD.
- |
  

- You'll feel like you're making meth on a beautiful secluded beach while the tide slowly rolls in and the refreshing, frothy water gently creeps up through the burn hole in your shoe.
- Free Your Life Force
- If you're having financial problems, examine the lab for anything that might be draining your life force.
- |
  

- Also look to see if you're on the best street corner for unloading rock.
- |
  

- If your corner is good, maybe that unruly backroom where you keep the sacks of lye is the problem area.
- |
  

- Or how about the broken lawn chair where you spend hours a day popping cold pills out of their infuriating foil packages?
- |
  

- Reworking these areas can unclog the drain, so to speak, and get the money flowing again.
- Build Harmony From the Outside In
- The need to keep the exterior of your meth lab nondescript isn't necessarily at odds with the principles of feng shui.
- |
  

- While you're at the store picking up bottles of ether and antifreeze, pick up some nice perennials and a few simple lights to line your walkway.
- |
  

- Make sure the lights are bright enough to symbolically illuminate the path to success but dim enough to obscure your face in surveillance photos.
- Be careful not to get too carried away with the landscaping.
- |
  

- After all, you don't want to attract unwanted attention from the neighbors.
- |
  

- If you're new to the area, someone will inevitably bring over cookies, so you'll just have to deal with that person as best you can.
- |
  

- Just be sure to fight the urge to show off your new feng-shui space.
- |
  

- Remember, it's still a meth lab and you're still wearing a gas mask, and that's a can of worms you don't want to open over a plate of pecan sandies.
