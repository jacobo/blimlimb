- I was fifteen when I bought the Creation Records compilation  Wild Summer Wow!
- |
  

- Creation Records was an indie British label, later famous for signing Oasis, that could only be found at record stores in the city; my friends and I gladly fled the suburbs to find them.

- I was thrilled and saved by the sulky pop songs on my turntable.
- |
  

- "The influence of 1960s music was obvious, but these songs, written by my contemporaries, were brand new, and that mattered to me: they were ours to discover."
- |
  

- I also loved knowing that I was one of few people hearing the songs in the States &#8212; or anywhere.
- |
  

- The songs ranged from the protest lyric of "Melt the Guns" by the X-Men to the somnolent aesthetic of my favorite song, Revolving Paint Dream's "In the Afternoon.
- "\" The songs wondered about one's engagement with a disappointing world: what kind of involvement?"
- |
  

- With whom?
- My copy of the LP was slightly warped, and I sometimes wondered if I was hearing the songs quite right.
- At the same time I was also discovering 80s alternative rock, and that was not good stuff for the young and hypersensitive.
- |
  

- My dad was right, it is possible that the Violent Femmes caused my downfall.
- |
  

- Their first album lodged inside my consciousness, like a twisted childhood trauma, forever encouraging me to be obsessed and tormented.
- |
  

- After that, fueled by bong hits and microdots, I really turned on at college.
- |
  

- Listening to the Birthday Party and the Swans, I ended up contracting mono, hepatitis, viral meningitis, and pneumonia.
- Coincidence?
- |
  

- I've always been impressionable, but I digress.
- "Mostly, I couldn't stop listening to the psychedelic song \"In the Afternoon\" by Revolving Paint Dream:"
- I never asked you your dream.
- Sometimes feelings go beyond words,
- |
  

- I cling to tender moments,
- |
  

- I don't feel real at all
- |
  

- Departure and resignation were immanent, it seemed, as I listened to the tragic singer sing without emotion.
- |
  

- Knowing I was queer, I felt that it would be years before I would experience even the painful parts of love, which I was convinced would come first.
- |
  

- "\"In the Afternoon\""
- |
  

- "Now, the lyrics also remind me of the film  Splendor in the Grass , in which Natalie Wood, humiliated by her sexual desire and recently rejected by Warren Beatty, is forced to recite in English class part of Wordsworth's \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality\":"
- Though nothing can bring back the hour
- |
  

- I saw the movie in high school, and cried uncontrollably.
- |
  

- "I know now that the writer, William Inge, was gay, and now I can't help but read the gay subtext: loving couple torn apart by small-town conventions and hypocrisy; one goes crazy, is institutionalized, and both eventually go emotionally dead."
- In "In the Afternoon," the guitar jangles; it sounds like bells. The organ, I think, rising and falling, provides a surface for the tired, sighing script of the lyrics.
- I never located either of Revolving Paint Dream's LPs,  Mother Watch Me Burn  or  Off to Heaven .
- |
  

- In a way I'm glad because I have just my perfect song, which along with the Smiths first album catapulted me into self-consciousness and made me think of the phrase "make love"; whose lyrics left me in lassitude, yet hopeful there would be sex and romance in my life one day.
- I wrote this piece to exemplify the Exploratory Essay for my Freshman English students.
- |
  

- Here is an example of writing without a thesis; here is an exploration of the song "In the Afternoon.
- "\" I gave up the idea when I realized I could lose my adjunct position for sharing such a queer piece with my students in Tampa, Florida, at a community college."
- They would have been a great audience, and I regret not taking the chance.

  I never asked you your dream.
  Sometimes feelings go beyond words,
  and now I cling to tender moments,
  and I don't feel real at all
  in the afternoon, your love was always lost
  Departure and resignation were immanent, it seemed, as I listened to the tragic singer sing without emotion. Knowing I was queer, I felt that it would be years before I would experience even the painful parts of love, which I was convinced would come first. "In the Afternoon" sweetened my fate.
  Now, the lyrics also remind me of the film  Splendor in the Grass , in which Natalie Wood, humiliated by her sexual desire and recently rejected by Warren Beatty, is forced to recite in English class part of Wordsworth's "Ode: Intimations of Immortality":
  Though nothing can bring back the hour
  of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower
  we will grieve not, rather find
  strength in what remains behind
