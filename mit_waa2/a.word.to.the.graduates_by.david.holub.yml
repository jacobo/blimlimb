- "\" he says."

- "\"We graduated 27 years ago."
- And, looking around, you realize he's right.
- |
  

- You wonder where it's all gone and realize you've been asleep, dreaming.
- |
  

- Of what, you're too embarrassed to say.
- |
  

- Cupcakes, perhaps.
- |
  

- As you begin to sob into your hands, you say to your college buddy, "I'm so sorry, Franklin.
- "\"Actually, no."
- "\"Hayes, is that you?"
- "\"No.\""
- "\"Salazar?"
- "\"No.\""
- You go back to weeping into your hands and he embraces you.
- |
  

- From the smell, you determine the hobo costume is no costume at all.
- |
  

- "But just as you begin to feel comforted\x97 poof \x97he's gone, and he took your watch."
- |
  

- On your wrist is a blue plastic replacement watch from a cereal box.
- |
  

- The time reads, "Welcome to the real world.
- There's a lesson in that.
- |
  

- Unfortunately, we've run short on time.
- "If I could give one piece of advice, it's this: Don't throw your hats up into the air, because eventually they'll fall back to the earth and likely hurt somebody."

- And if you've been maimed or killed during my speech, then I apologize.
- |
  

- It turns out I probably could have made my point without lions.
