- A DISPATCH BY  JAMES WAGNER
- |
  

- CENTRAL NEW YORK &#151; I was wheeling my return cart into the heating aisle today, looking to unload bird guards, when a man suddenly appeared out of nowhere.
- |
  

- He displayed the classic wearied-irritated expressions and arm movements common to our shoppers.
- |
  

- He wanted to know where the vents were for the bathroom, you know, the dryer.
- I paused, because he wasn't making himself clear whether he was really looking for venting for a bathroom or venting for a dryer.
- |
  

- He was highly fidgety and irritated that I wasn't following him, and he became sarcastic.
- |
  

- "\"Jesus,\""
- |
  

- "\"Um, you know, the bathroom fan."
- I said, "Oh, the bathroom fans?
- |
  

- They're over here.
- "\" I walked away from the heating aisle, proceeded down a few more aisles, and pointed to the display of faucets."
- |
  

- I told him they were on the opposite side of the display.
- |
  

- He said, okay, and then left.
- I returned to the heating aisle.
- A few minutes later, the man came race-walking up to me and, with a very serious expression on his face, said, "You're a liar.
- |
  

- You lied to me.
- |
  

- There are no bath fan vents over there.
- I said, "You told me you wanted a bath fan, that's where the bath fans are.
- He said, "No, I didn't.
- I said, "Yes, you did &#151; I wouldn't have sent you over there if you hadn't said that.
- He changed the subject.
- The man was almost jumping out of his clothing, running around, picking up things, putting them back in the wrong spots.
- |
  

- He said, "I need, I need, I need a, you know, a Wye vent, you got a Wye vent, and what about the venting, too, do you have the white kind or just this here metal kind, because what I want to do, you know, is to hook it up, you know, oh, here's the white, like this here, this here picture, and I need the Wye vent, do you have that, because the Wye vent is needed for me to move it the way I want.
- |
  

- Do you have a Wye vent?
- I was looking for the Wye vent while he was going through the entire talk.
- |
  

- I found vent elbows and vent tees, but no Wye vents.
- |
  

- I still kept looking because I thought I saw them a week ago.
- He was about ten feet away from me, searching in the dryer vent area, picking up vent couplers and reducers.
- |
  

- He moved into the shelf area then darted back to his cart, often holding the same item in his hand without putting it back on the shelf or in his cart.
- |
  

- He was rocking, really.
- |
  

- It was in this state of movement that he suddenly began a stream of talk that consisted entirely of the phrase, "Wye vent.
- |
  

- You know, a Wye vent.
- "\" This lasted a good fifteen to twenty seconds."
- |
  

- In the middle of it, I thought there might be something wrong with him, like his synapses were stuck.
- During my searching and his weaving, my store manager called, telling me to come to the kitchen and bath display area, so he could show me how to special order a faucet.
- |
  

- I told the man that I couldn't find a Wye vent, and that I was needed elsewhere.
- |
  

- I asked if he was all set with everything before I left the aisle.
- He said, "Really, you don't have a Wye vent?
- |
  

- What about a tee, you got a tee?
- I said, yes, that we did have tees, and asked whether he wanted a three- or a four-inch one.
- |
  

- He chose the three-inch.
- |
  

- As I was getting the three-inch tee for him, my phone rang again.
- |
  

- It was from the woman from Returns &#151; she wanted to let me know that my return cart was full.
- |
  

- I said, okay, and hung up.
- |
  

- I handed the tee to the man, and again asked if he was all set.
- He started to make some incomprehensible sounds, sounds that still somehow told me he needed me.
- |
  

- I had given up getting to the kitchen and bath area for the lesson in special ordering faucets.
- |
  

- As I waited for him to say something, the phone rang again.
- |
  

- It was a local call.
- |
  

- The man wanted to find out about hot water heaters, how much they were.
- |
  

- I told the man in the heating aisle that I would be back and walked over to the hot water heater area.
- |
  

- I gave the man on the phone the information he needed.
- |
  

- I answered a few more questions from customers in the same aisle and then became sidetracked by a woman who needed a peephole for her door.
- |
  

- I walked down to the Doors aisle first, where an associate told me they were in Hardware.
- |
  

- Then the woman and I walked back to Hardware, and started looking for peepholes.
- |
  

- I couldn't find them, so I called an associate in Hardware to help me.
- |
  

- He came over and pointed to where they were.
- It was now about fifteen to twenty minutes since I had last talked with the Wye vent man in the heating aisle.
- |
  

- I felt relieved that I wasn't dealing with him anymore, because I was getting nervous around him.
- |
  

- I decided not to return to the heating aisle for at least another half hour.
- |
  

- By then, I figured, he would be gone.
- As I was walking down the plumbing aisle, which is my home area, I saw the man talking with another associate.
- |
  

- As I came closer, I saw the bewildered look on the face of the associate and the wide-eyed look of the bath fan vent man.
- |
  

- He was asking the associate if we had any Wye vents.
- Two hours later I found a three-inch tee vent in my return cart.
