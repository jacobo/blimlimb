- "Re: Hardy Boys Manuscript Submission"
- "Dear Sir:"
- Thank you for your submission of a Hardy Boys mystery.
- |
  

- As explained in our submission guidelines, to appeal to today's readers, the Hardy Boys series seeks to bring a contemporary feel to its newest offerings.
- |
  

- While we here at Simon & Schuster fully appreciate your efforts to modernize the characters and their adventures, as per our instructions, we have some concerns with your draft.
- First and foremost, we are unpersuaded that the subject matter of  The Case of the Secret Meth Lab  is appropriate for our readers.
- |
  

- We understand that the manufacturing of narcotics in otherwise bucolic towns has indeed become a problem.
- |
  

- That said, we ask you whether Joe Hardy would realistically go undercover and turn into what his brother repeatedly refers to as a "crankhead.
- "Page 42: While it is important to end each chapter with a cliffhanger, we don't think Frank pacing outside the bathroom door while his girlfriend, Callie, uses a First Response pregnancy test is consistent with the Hardy Boys formula."
- |
  

- And he certainly shouldn't be muttering under his breath about doubts that it's even his.
- "Page 50: Colorful banter between the brothers is, of course, to be expected."
- |
  

- Please reconsider, however, whether Joe would tell Frank to "grow a pair.
- "\" Further, Joe would not dismiss Frank's suggestion to call for help with \""
- Step off, bitch.
- |
  

- I know what I'm doing.
- "Page 57: Lighthearted exchanges with family members have always been a staple of the series."
- |
  

- We are having trouble, however, with Aunt Gertrude "tying a few on" and playfully commenting that Frank is "a little light in the loafers.
- "\" On that note, Frank's adamant attempt to persuade Chet Morton that it is entirely normal for boys to skinny-dip together and his persistent requests for help applying sunblock are probably out of bounds."
- |
  

- "Question: When did Frank develop a lisp?"
- "Page 60: We encourage including Nancy Drew in the adventure as it represents great cross-marketing with our other adventure series."
- |
  

- We would think it goes without saying, however, that she would not have, nor even contemplate, surgical enhancement.
- |
  

- Please delete all references to her "killer rack.
- "Page 72: While we understand that violence is a necessary part of any adventure series, we think it best that it be downplayed and referred to as delicately as possible."
- |
  

- Neither Frank nor Joe has ever "popped a cap" in anyone's posterior and they never will. Furthermore, we would prefer that Joe's "going medieval" on the villain in this scene explicitly refer to a swift uppercut punch.
- |
  

- Period.
- "Page 80: What's a \"k-hole\"? Please clarify."
- We look forward to receiving your revisions.
- |
  

- Please bear in mind that we are well aware of the difficulties of maintaining a proper balance between the series' original concept and the need to reflect current social and cultural norms.
- |
  

- That said, your proposal for the next book in the series,  The Mystery of the Hot Girl in the Night-Cam Video , is likely not headed in the right direction.
- Sincerely yours,
- Eugene Simmons
