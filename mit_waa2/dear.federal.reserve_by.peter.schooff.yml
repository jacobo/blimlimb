- "Dear Federal Reserve:"
- I'm a waitress at a diner off the Beltway, and I just want you to know that Mr. Greenspan is the worst tipper EVER!
- |
  

- He's been coming to the diner for years and has never left a tip.
- |
  

- Not one dime.
- |
  

- Once I asked him about it, and you know what he told me?
- |
  

- He said I should consider myself lucky that he never tipped.
- |
  

- He said that if he did tip me, it could lead to inflationary pressure and that could upend the whole U.S.
- |
  

- Inflationary pressure my ass.
- |
  

- "To Whom It May Concern:"
- I run the town dump outside of Pawtucky, Virginia, and as of late we've had this skinny old fellow visiting our dump.
- |
  

- He usually drives up after dusk in his pick-up truck, parks alongside the fence, then sets up a folding chair and a cooler of beer in the truck's bed.
- |
  

- He takes out his shotgun, gets drunk, and shoots bears.
- |
  

- At first I didn't mind too much, as we do have ourselves a bear problem, but lately this fellow's coming every night.
- |
  

- Yesterday, I had one of my boys crawl up real close to his truck.
- |
  

- After the old man plugged a bear, all my boy heard was this eerie, hollow-sounding cackle.
- |
  

- "You know, like this: Heh heh heh, except real soft."
- |
  

- Of course, you know by now that I suspect this fellow is your boy Greenspan.
- |
  

- You might want to have someone talk to him, you think?
- |
  

- "To Sane Person at the Federal Reserve:"
- I am writing this letter to let you know that Mr. Alan Greenspan is a total lunatic.
- |
  

- I manage the Gap store in Georgetown, and just this morning Mr. Greenspan came in to buy a pair of plain khakis.
- The only problem was the pants had been on sale yesterday, but were not on sale today.
- |
  

- Mr. Greenspan claimed that because he had been in important meetings all yesterday, he should get the sale price.
- I told him that was not store policy.
- |
  

- Mr. Greenspan got really angry and asked me if I really thought store policy covered high-level meetings with the President of the United States.
- |
  

- I told him I didn't care if he was meeting with the President of the United States, the sale was over, and so he had to pay full price.
- Well, Mr. Greenspan flew into a rage, punched our sock display, and vowed to raise interest rates so high that every retail store in America, including my Gap, would quote-unquote feel his rage and then have to close.
- |
  

- With that, he stormed out of my store.
- Mr. Greenspan isn't really going to intentionally destabilize the economy so that I'll never again see a period of high growth and low inflation in my lifetime, is he?
- |
  

- "Dear Federal Reserve:"
- I was at the D.C.
- |
  

- Nordstrom last Tuesday when I had a little run-in with your Alan Greenspan.
- |
  

- I was in the jewelry section, just about to try on a diamond necklace, when Alan Greenspan charged me from behind and tackled me to the ground.
- |
  

- He climbed on top of me and started slugging me in the face.
- |
  

- Lucky he's so old and weak or he might have really done some damage.
- |
  

- While he was punching me, he asked me to repeat after him, "Say it wasn't a speculative bubble.
- Right away I knew what the mix-up was, and explained I hadn't said anything about a speculative bubble, but had in fact said, about the necklace I was trying on, "This is one spectacular bauble.
- You and your hearing impaired boss will be hearing from my attorney.
- |
  

- "To a Sagittarius at the Federal Reserve:"
- Hi.
- |
  

- I work at a certain well-known psychic hotline and I really need your help.
- |
  

- Lately, I've had this older gentleman calling me, and although he tries to sound British, I can tell he's American.
- |
  

- He's a Pisces, and instead of asking me his horoscope, he always wants me to predict what the Federal Reserve is going to do about interest rates.
- |
  

- Without fail, whatever numbers I rattle off dictate what the Fed does the next day.
- I want to be upfront with you here, so I'm going to let you in on a little trade secret.
- |
  

- Even though I work at a psychic hotline, I'm not really a true psychic.
- |
  

- What I do is I just make the stuff up, you know, off the top of my head.
- |
  

- It would be a big help to me if one of you guys just decided what the rate should be and told me what to say before he calls the next time.
- |
  

- Okay?
- |
