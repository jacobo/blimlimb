- How do birds have sex?
- |
  

- Female birds have the egg laying hole/cloaca thingie, which is kind of like a vagina, I guess.
- |
  

- Some male birds have penises, but others just have a little container area where the sperm goes into.
- |
  

- So in those cases, does the male bird kind of put the hole of his container area next to the female's cloaca-hole and kind of pour it in there?
- |
  

- Recently astronomers announced the discovery of a planet 2.5 times larger than the mass of Jupiter.
- |
  

- It is now the oldest planet we know of in the universe.
- Will we wince when it kisses us with its bristly face?
- |
  

- Lightning is jagged, not straight, because the channel (which results from the attraction between negative electrical charge in the cloud and positive charge induced in the ground) tends to extend out to regions of higher conductivity.
- Or maybe&#8230; the cloud's just trying to be snazzy?
- |
  

- Blue crabs can switch back and forth between old and new skeletons during the molting process.
- I bet they sure confuse their friends and families!
- "\"Ed?"
- |
  

- Is that you?
- "\" Ha ha!"
- |
  

- Reflexive sneezing induced by light, and sunlight in particular, is estimated to occur in 18 to 35 percent of the population and is known as the photic sneeze reflex (PSR) or the ACHOO (autosomal dominant compulsive helio-ophthalmic outbursts of sneezing) syndrome
- More like these people are having a flashback about their jobs when they were in prison, toiling under the harsh fluorescent glare of the pepper factory.
