- To date, the longest period of time I have spent in bed is probably no more than 12 hours.

- I usually sleep for about eight hours and then I'm out of bed within the first 15 minutes after waking.

- From July 31 to October 23, I will be doing all these things in bed.

- These and other things.

- I will be bedridden, and I have longed for the opportunity.

- My home will be a room in the Cleveland Clinic.

- I will lie down on a Monday morning and not rise until 12 weeks later.
- |
  

- During this time, my head will be six degrees lower than my feet, I will urinate in a bottle, and I will play hundreds of games of online Scrabble.
- |
  

- It will all be in the name of science.
- NASA is conducting a study to document, as best they can, the effects of inactivity on a person, specifically on muscle and bone.
- |
  

- There will be 12 sessions in this study, each installment involving two human subjects in bed for three months.
- |
  

- In total, 12 of them will be inactive for that time, and 12 will be put on a daily exercise program.
- |
  

- I do not know yet which group I will be in.
- |
  

- All 24 subjects will be in the head-down position (in which one's head is six degrees lower than one's feet) for 84 days.
- The tests done on me before, during, and after this bed-rest session will give scientists a greater understanding of bone loss and muscle atrophy, so that we might put astronauts on Mars.
- |
  

- I will remain sedentary so that others might go the greatest distance yet.
- |
  

- I am permitted to read, write, use a computer, and watch TV.
- |
  

- Those are the things I can do.
- |
  

- I am forbidden, however, from straying from protocol.
- |
  

- Protocol says I cannot put pressure on the bottoms of my feet or pick my head up.
- |
  

- This means I will use bedpans, inflatable bathtubs, and rubber-pronged grabbing tools to perform my daily functions.
- |
  

- While I am allowed visitors, none of these visits are to be of the conjugal variety.
- |
  

- I will be monitored constantly by a surveillance camera.
- "Almost everybody says the same thing when I tell them about this: \"You're crazy."
- "\" I understand why they would think that, but I think they're being obtuse."
- |
  

- Like millions of other people, I have been either working or going to school full-time for the past 20 years.
- |
  

- During this period, I have pushed aside great plans, giant tasks, to focus on that which took up most of my waking hours, that which I didn't particularly care about.
- |
  

- "Here will be at least 84 days of my life in which I get the opportunity to focus on my personal projects: reading, writing, thinking, studying, learning."
- |
  

- Though I will be under unblinking surveillance by hospital staff, I will not have any priorities that are not created by myself.
- |
  

- This is what originally attracted me to the study.
- |
  

- Instead of letting days get away from me as they do now, I will be able to squeeze every second from 84 of them.
- Will I get bored?
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- Will I lose sight of the end?
- |
  

- Occasionally.
- |
  

- Will this be everything I thought it would be?
- |
  

- We'll see.

- In these dispatches, I hope to chronicle the high and low tides, the thoughts and feelings that come from elation or depression, and all the experiences of a man who is voluntarily bedridden in the name of science.
