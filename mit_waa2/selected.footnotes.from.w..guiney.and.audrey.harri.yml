  INTRODUCTION: THE DAYS OF THE NIBLUNGS, NOTE 6
  Gen. 6: 11-12. God's solution, the Great Flood, like the activities of an insect exterminator, might have removed any number of vermin, but this morning's newspaper reminds me that the achievement was temporary.
  ON THE AESTHETICS OF WEAPONS, NOTE 8
  And those unfortunate enough to live in war zones, while they might be even more prone to admire weapons, as some do, will also of course tranquilize themselves with peace. I remember one Sarajevo bar "protected" by irregulars, where bad music still played and they still had booze, the girls were laughing and it was packed.

  DEFENSE OF RACE AND CULTURE, NOTE 220
  As in the U.N. pullout from Somalia a century later (see "Let Me Know If You're Scared"), the strategy was to declare an implausible victory once the occupier was sufficiently exhausted.
  DEFENSE OF RACE AND CULTURE, NOTE 346
  In the inimitable words of the former Opium King, Khun Sa: "When someone else farts, you are all too willing to say it's got a pleasant smell. But you refuse to listen when one of your own people speaks. Just let me ask you who you are?" (Khun Sa, p. 56, "National Unity").
  DEFENSE OF HOMELAND, NOTE 5
  Some examples: In wartime Serbia I've seen a leather boutique displaying nothing but pistol holsters. In Indonesia, a full-window display of tampons and sanitary napkins. In France (never in India!), smoked carcasses in the butcher's window. In Mexico, rolls of tanned goatskins tightly stacked; to see what one really looks like, you must persuade a clerk. In Thailand, the King's portrait everywhere.
  DEFENSE OF HOMELAND, NOTE 127
  This moral algebra can be expressed as follows:
    Let defense of homeland  = H
    Other political-ethical variables  = A-F
   Then: H1 + [A1 + B1 + C1] = ? = H2 + [D2 + E2 + F2]
   Therefore: A1 + B1 + C1 = ? = D2 + E2 + F2, which at least simplifies the equation.

  Just in case I haven't made myself clear, I am opposed to almost everything.
