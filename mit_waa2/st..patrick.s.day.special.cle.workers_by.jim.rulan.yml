  From  The Curious History of St. Briggs the Benevolent
  St. Briggs the Benevolent has long been overshadowed by the figure of St. Brodie the Quick-Tempered, whom Briggs is said to have accompanied on his early travels. Briggs was born in Ireland, probably on the Dingle peninsula. Little is known of his childhood, but he is believed to have been one of the young latecomers mentioned in  Navigatio Sancti Brodi Abbattis  who joined Brodie on his voyage to the Promised Land. "The latecomers were led to the boat by the neck for prayer." Modern translators, however, have substituted "latecomer" with "stowaway" or "reluctant passenger," and there is considerable evidence for the latter, slavery being a preferred means of cheap labor for the seawardly mobile.
  We can be certain that Briggs did not sail with Brodie long and embarked on missionary voyages of his own. However, strange circumstances surround his many journeys, and he was frequently poorly received. In  Triumph Over Self-Satisfaction , Fr. Eugene O'Dolomiter writes: "came to Iveraugh a strange figure of a noseless monk in a boat made of skins." Michael Fenner's  A Compleat History of Inch  amplifies this matter:
  [Briggs] volunteered to baptise every man, woman and child in the vicinity, but the wild-looking stranger was rejected by the people of the towne, His odd appearance set their hearts hard against him and the Children threw stones and old vegetables, some of which he bore back to his curious boat.
  The origin of Briggs's deformity is not known. While many histories suggest he was born with his peculiar disfigurement, Victor Farladoon's  Dingle, Sweet Dingle  claims he lost his nose in a fishing accident with his brothers:
  Be assured, sir, the salmon of the Shannon had themselves God's own cartilaginous feast.
