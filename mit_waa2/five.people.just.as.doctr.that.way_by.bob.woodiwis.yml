  I only have to look at Antonin Scalia for, like, three seconds to see he has serious dietary issues. I mean, there's his portly build, his pastiness, his schlumpy posture. Everything about the man screams \"non-cruelty-free lifestyle.\" You can't tell me he's not covertly pushing the carnivore/predatory agenda. Beyond that, he's obviously ingesting way too much dairy, because the river of bile he spews can only be the result of abnormal liver function. The biggest thing, though, is, if he were getting enough legumes and whole grains, he'd never have let Bush steal the 2000 election.\n\
