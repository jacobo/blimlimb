- Last year, Peter McGrath and Jenny Traig, cousins, left their jobs to become self-declared shut-ins.
- |
  

- They quickly discovered that the shut-in's life is full of many small mysteries.
- |
  

- More recently they discovered that these mysteries often unfold in the lavatory, and some that don't, should.
- |
  

- But forensics can be a dirty business, and there's no sugar-coating the truth.
- |
  

- Here, then, with apologies to their gentle readers, are more cases from their files.
- |
  

- The Case of the Sloppy Brusher
- "Status: Solved"
- Several weeks ago the shut-ins' chore wheel indicated it was their roommate Angela's turn to clean the bathroom.
- |
  

- She did an excellent job and everyone admired the gleaming sink.
- |
  

- But within twenty minutes, Angela's work had been besmirched by toothpaste smears and whitish spittle.
- |
  

- Who was the sloppy brusher?
- No one had left the apartment, so the perp was still on the premises.
- |
  

- Jenny and Peter ruled out themselves because they brush very infrequently.
- |
  

- "This left two suspects: Angela and their other roommate, Daniel."
- |
  

- Daniel swore he hadn't brushed his teeth yet; Angela swore she'd brushed hers before she'd cleaned the sink in the first place.
- "\"One of you is lying,\""
- |
  

- Peter announced.
- |
  

- "\"In order to ascertain which, I will use the science of forensics."
- |
  

- Please allow me to smell your breath.
- "\" The suspects obliged."
- |
  

- Angela's proved minty; Daniel's, quite stale.
- |
  

- "\"Now, do I have your permission to finger your toothbrushes?"
- "\" The suspects refused, so Peter pretended he had to use the facilities and handled the brushes in privacy."
- |
  

- Angela's was damp, as expected, but so was Daniel's.
- |
  

- Traces of toothpaste on his brush matched that in the sink.
- |
  

- Yet Daniel's breath indicated he hadn't brushed at all.
- |
  

- What was going on?
- Peter remained in the lavatory for quite some time.
- |
  

- When he emerged, he revealed the solution.
- |
  

- "\"Angela and Daniel, you are both telling the truth, and the crime is more heinous than originally feared."
- |
  

- Daniel's brush was the weapon, but the criminal is none other than my dear cousin Jenny.
- |
  

- She used your brush and I suspect she's been making a habit of it.
- "\" A sniff of Jenny's breath confirmed Peter's theory."
- |
  

- The sorry episode concluded when Daniel gave Jenny his sullied toothbrush and a very stern rebuke.
- |
  

- The Case of the Overlong Bathroom Tenure
- "Status: Investigation Suspended"
- One quiet afternoon, Peter and Jenny were peacefully tatting a tablecloth when the doorbell rang.
- |
  

- It was Mr. E---, a casual acquaintance.
- |
  

- He visited with the detectives for a few moments, then asked to use their lavatory.
- |
  

- Nearly half an hour passed before Mr. E--- emerged, whereupon he apologized profusely and unintelligibly, then left.
- The detectives were shaken but curious.
- |
  

- What, exactly, had gone on in there?
- |
  

- Like many seasoned investigators, Peter and Jenny prefer to consider all findings before examining the crime scene itself.
- |
  

- Conducting their inquiry from the relative safety of the couch, they reviewed the clues.
- Mr. E--- had brought neither food nor drink with him, yet he left looking bloated.
- |
  

- Was it possible that he'd helped himself to a snack of fancy soaps and the leave-in conditioner Peter can only get at the salon?
- |
  

- Possible.
- Mr. E--- had been very vocal.
- |
  

- Was it possible that he'd mistaken the lavatory for a phone booth?
- |
  

- Possible.
- |
  

- People mistake the latter for the former all the time.
- Mr. E--- had left wet and disoriented.
- |
  

- Was it possible that he had, according to the popular idiom, "fallen in"? Yes, possible.
- After much deliberation, the sleuths agreed they would never know what happened without a close, on-site investigation of the lavatory itself.
- |
  

- They then agreed ignorance wasn't such a bad thing.
- |
  

- Although it seemed likely that Mr. E--- had committed some atrocities during his tenure in that room, the nature of these would remain a mystery.
- |
  

- The Case of the Congested Drainpipe
- "Status: Solved"
- One recent morning found Peter and Jenny enjoying an "eye-opener" of malt liquor on their back porch. All seemed right with the world. Suddenly, their idyll was punctured by a scream from their roommate Daniel. The detectives rushed inside, where Daniel stood clutching himself and shaking.
- "\"I just wanted to take a shower,\""
- |
  

- "\"But when I pulled back the shower curtain, I was greeted with a foul surprise."
- |
  

- There's a foot of standing water in the tub.
- |
  

- When I plunged my arm into the morass to clear it, I encountered a fistful of fur, scum, and nail clippings.
- |
  

- It was like shaking hands with Death.
- |
  

- I fled and here you find me now.
- |
  

- What in the world can be down that drain?
- Jenny and Peter calmed their friend with a draught of grog and considered possible culprits.
- |
  

- Was the stoppage some sort of marine life form?
- |
  

- Was it drain lichen?
- |
  

- Or was it debris left behind by their lavatory-polluting acquaintance, Mr. E---?
- Before the detectives arrived at an answer, their fearless roommate Angela rolled up her sleeves and cleared the drain herself.
- |
  

- "\"It's a hair clog, you babies."
- |
  

- Case closed.
- The mystery was solved.
- |
  

- The sleuths and their roommates returned to the cold comfort of their "breakfast" and soon all unpleasantness was forgotten.
- |
  

- The Case of the Steaming Indiscretion
- "Status: Solved"
- Peter received an urgent call from his sister, a teacher in a public junior high school.
- |
  

- She had an inquiry of a delicate nature.
- |
  

- "\"Someone took a crap in the middle of my classroom."
- |
  

- It must have been one of the kids.
- |
  

- But I can't figure out how anyone could have done that with no one noticing, especially during Quiet Time.
- |
  

- It happened when they were supposed to be reading silently and I was correcting papers.
- |
  

- It was [expletive] disgusting.
- "\" Peter was intrigued by his sister's enigma and agreed to investigate it."
- He and Jenny discussed the case at length.
- |
  

- Regrettably, this was not the first time they'd had to solve a mystery of this nature.
- |
  

- In the past the culprit had always proved to be their friend Mr. B---, but as he was neither Peter's sister's student nor a resident of her state, he was not a suspect.
- |
  

- They considered other scenarios.
- |
  

- Was it possible that the culprit was not a student, but a class pet?
- |
  

- "No: there was no pet; and besides, the sample was unmistakably that of a human."
- |
  

- "Then was it possible that the specimen was not, as she said, \"crap,\" but a more benign material? No: it was most certainly offal. Well, then, was it conceivable that Mr. B--- had mastered astral projection and had traveled to the classroom, bodiless, to commit the heinous misdeed? No: the criminal had needed a body to commit the crime."
- When they couldn't come up with a satisfactory conclusion, the detectives reluctantly determined they would have to recreate the scene at home.
- |
  

- Before they did, Peter's sister telephoned again, with some startling&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and to our sleuths, revelatory&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;information.
- "\"So one of the kids' moms called me tonight."
- |
  

- She said she was worried about 'the incident'&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;"
- "\"A-ha!"
- "\"Would you let me finish?"
- "\"My dear sister, I believe you will excuse my interruption if I tell you what you have just said is highly illuminating."
- "\"No [expletive], Sherlock."
- |
  

- I was just about to say, Mrs. M--- told me her son was the kid who snapped one off.
- |
  

- Apparently, it fell down his pant leg.
- The enigma was solved.
- |
  

- Peter and Jenny then set upon investigating the more pressing mystery of why they continue to maintain a friendship with Mr. B---.
