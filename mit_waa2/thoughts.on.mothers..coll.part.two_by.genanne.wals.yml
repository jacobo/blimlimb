- Ingenuity
- She stuck her arm into a cow up to the armpit to pull out a breached calf.
- Jonah, 89, poet
- When we needed rent money, she'd let her boss take her out to his favorite steakhouse and feel her up under the table.
- |
  

- But she'd have me call the restaurant at a certain time, so she could say one of us was sick and get home before things got out of hand.
- Louise, 47, customs broker
- My mom always had the right answer to our questions.
- |
  

- When I asked her how come dad always sat around in the den waiting to give advice, she said he needed to do it to feel useful.
- |
  

- So we'd come up with a new question to ask him each week, and she'd practice my lines with me before I went in there.
- |
  

- What a woman.

- |
  

- I haven't even told her I have a daughter.
- Audrey, 38, marketing specialist
- Having me was her biggest mistake.
- |
  

- She died of complications after I was born.
- |
  

- As a girl, I'd sit on her grave and read her writings.
- |
  

- People ask me, "How did you, an educated lady, dream up such a horrifying monster?
- "\" It wasn't the drugs we took that weekend, or Percy's influence, as some have suggested."
- |
  

- It was thinking about her, and what she could have been.
- Mary, 53, writer
- She'd hide her empty vodka bottles behind the woodpile.
- |
  

- Once, I was playing back there and fell and gashed my shin open on the broken glass.
- |
  

- Seventeen stitches.
- |
  

- I still have a scar.
- Dawn, 38, yoga teacher
- She ran over the family dog.
- |
  

- She was backing the Ford out of the driveway when my brother started screaming.

- |
  

- I was with her, but then we got separated, and I saw my friends and I knew if I stayed to find her, I'd die.
- |
  

- So I left, I left her there.
