- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if I were a  patient  lawyer, I'd make this closing argument into a long-winded speech about the inadequacies of our criminal-justice system, the failings of our nation's social-support networks, and the tragedy of mistaken identity.

- But I am  not  a patient lawyer.
- |
  

- I can freely admit that.
- |
  

- I've had enough of this trial, and I can see by your weary eyes that you're tired, too.
- |
  

- You've spent the last few months sitting here in this crowded courtroom, hearing day after day of testimony and sifting through endless boxes of evidence.
- |
  

- By now, you're probably as sick of hearing me talk as I am of talking, so I won't bore you by blathering on about the criminal-justice system, social-support networks, and mistaken identity.
- |
  

- I'm sure that neither of us has the patience.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if I were a  brilliant  lawyer, I'd deliver an eloquent, deftly delivered speech right now to convince you that my client is innocent.
- |
  

- I'd quote renowned poets, cite legal precedents, spout Latin phrases, and, in the end, ask you to consider whether it's my client on trial here or, in fact, humanity itself.
- |
  

- But, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am  not  a brilliant lawyer.
- |
  

- I can freely admit that.
- |
  

- Hell, for most of this trial, I've been sitting here doing Sudoku puzzles, and I haven't solved a damn one.
- |
  

- Also, for the longest time, I thought "ipso facto" was a city in Michigan.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if I were an  emotionally stable  lawyer, this is where I'd recite a litany of reasons why my client couldn't possibly have committed the crimes for which he stands accused, calmly appealing to your logic, your common sense, and your compassion as I sowed the seeds of doubt that would eventually lead to my client's complete exoneration.
- |
  

- As some of you may have guessed by the way I wept uncontrollably through the jury-selection process, however, these last few months have been a difficult time for me.
- |
  

- Ever since my wife, Barbara, ran off to Albuquerque with her tennis instructor, I've suffered from bouts of depression, anxiety attacks, and fits of rage.
- |
  

- Now that I'm seeing a therapist, I recognize that I am  not  an emotionally stable lawyer.
- |
  

- I can freely admit that.
- |
  

- I also recognize that shrieking, "Why, Barbara?
- |
  

- Oh, God, why?
- "\" throughout my opening statement might have been somewhat off-putting, especially to those of you named Barbara."
- |
  

- In retrospect, it also may not have been the strongest defense strategy.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if I were a  sober  lawyer, I'd take this time to repudiate the prosecution's arguments by finding flaws in their logic and showing that each of their witnesses has a strong self-interest to incriminate my client.
- |
  

- Also, I'd be wearing pants.
- |
  

- But the water pitcher on the table in front of me is full of vodka, I've been on a two-month bender, and, apparently, I keep mistaking the witness box for a restroom.
- |
  

- No, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am definitely  not  a sober lawyer.
- |
  

- I can freely admit that.
- |
  

- It is, after all, the first step.
- |
  

- By the way, let me apologize to Mrs. Pelkins, once again, for the unfortunate incident during her cross-examination.
- |
  

- I blame bad chorizo.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if I were a  sane  lawyer, I might have called my client by his real name instead of repeatedly referring to him as "Mama Ape Breath.
- "\" Also, I might not have licked every piece of evidence or responded to each of the prosecution's objections with a motion to make soup hats."
- |
  

- Furthermore, I might not have called a donkey to the witness stand and then, using only armpit noises, performed Gilbert and Sullivan's  The Mikado  in its entirety.
- |
  

- But, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I am  not  a sane lawyer.
- |
  

- I can freely admit that.
- |
  

- When your cat talks like Herbert Hoover, you've got bigger fish to fry.
- So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in conclusion, let me just say that although I am not a patient, brilliant, emotionally stable, sober, or sane lawyer, even  I  can see that my client, Mama Ape Breath, is not guilty.
- |
  

- I hope, by God, that you can see it, too.
- Now who's up for making soup hats?
