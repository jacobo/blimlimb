  Dear Gary,
  Let me open by offering my condolences to you and your boy about my team,
  the Shoney's Lions whupping you 52-9 last Saturday. I shook your hand after
  the game, and when I tried to talk you sprinted to your mini van. Oh well.
  Say, I'm sure you'll agree that Ricky "Stud" Sanders, Jr.  is a great QB.
  What's even more great is that I am helping Ricky "Stud" Sanders, Jr. with
  sports and with life because he doesn't have a Ricky Sanders, Sr. to offer
  him moral support and spot for him as he bounces his little waist against
  life's uneven parallel bars. Ricky Sanders, Sr. vanished with an 18-wheeler
  full of kerosene lamps into the Great Smokey Mtns. (a.k.a. the Bermuda Triangle
  of Trucking) and was never heard from again. This occurred when Ricky "Stud"
  Sanders, Jr. was 1-day old. So, as you can see, he has a lot of questions.
  I feel more equipped to answer Ricky's questions and answer your sometimes
  "harsh" letters because I've been working on me. Those classes I was forced
  to take frightened me at first, but finally I had what they call a
  breakthrough and now I am practicing Witness Fitness. That's where members
  of the community agree to monitor each other's mental and emotional
  well-being and stave off any negative backsliding. One of my witnesses,
  Dwight, said look at chapter 33 of your manual.
  Chapter 33 had been written expressly for me it seemed. It deals with
  "Emotional Scratch-Offs." I had been playing my own life like the lottery.
  And losing. I had gambled all my happiness on little, quick, empty moments
  that weren't feeding my soul. I was more interested in coaching, sour cream
  and onion potato chips, MGD Light, fondling some hot tail, and failing that,
  fondling myself. Or both. And yelling at kids. Ugh.
  Your letters used to hot me up something fierce. Like tree-stump screwing
  mad. But now I realize that we all have a road to take and we are all
  blossoming in our own way. We are, Gary!  I'm sorry your relationship with
  the Mrs. retreated to limbo status. My shoulder is here. And, for the
  foreseeable future, my shoulder is here for all adult men or females to shed
  tears on. You can rest-assured I never got with her even though she sent me
  illicit notes asking for gas-pump trysts. I had some shreds of character
  then. And now, I have even more character. I am character-heavy, with a
