- "EPISODE SIX: FAN MAIL"
- When folks ask me why I write about teen-scene celebrities, which was exactly the question posed to me last night by a young man who would not look out of place in a Whit Stillman movie, I cite a 1998 poll that gleefully revealed that more adolescents recognized Leonardo DiCaprio than Vice-President Al Gore.

- Just like Howie D.'s dream to develop condominiums on the East Coast of Florida, LeAnn Rimes' plans to study speech pathology, and Leo's musings on celebrity ("Fame is like a VIP pass wherever you want to go").  Somebody out there actually cares about this stuff.
- Someone like Lan X. Le.
- Yours Forever
- You came into my life  Like an unexepted hurricane  You filled my life with music  You brought me life and joy  You stole my heart  Yet you don't realize that I'm here  Standing here, waiting for you.
- I love but not love in return  My life is fufilled  But my heart are empty  Come to me now  Make me yours and forever  Embrace me in your arms  We will soar together to place lover never went
- I will bring you love like no others  Give me a change to prove my love  Don't lock me out  Open your heart and let love in  I will be your moon, stars, and sun  I will be your everything  Make me your and forever.
- I know of your rejecting love  And it harden your heart  You feel that you could never love again  Babe, I'm not like the others  I will walk a million miles  Just to see your smile and heard your laughter  I will never leave you  Just want to be with you till I die.

  EPISODE SIX: FAN MAIL
  When folks ask me why I write about teen-scene celebrities,
  which was exactly the question posed to me last night by a
  young man who would not look out of place in a Whit Stillman
  movie, I cite a 1998 poll that gleefully revealed that more
  adolescents recognized Leonardo DiCaprio than Vice-President
  Al Gore.   While this may imply that a valuable and
  influential demographic would rather buy one of my books
  than say,  Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit,  
  it is not my intention to profit from my business.  Like
  Francis Bacon, I "take pleasure in the action itself, and
  not in the purchase."
  Besides, I'm after something much larger than a $1,250 (flat
  fee) paycheck.
  And while I suppose that documenting flash-in-the-pants boy
  bands does, on a deeper level, say something about the
  impermanence of art&nbsp;&#151; like Julian Schnabel's broken plates
  or Damien Hirst's pickled cow halves&nbsp;&#151; what I'm coming to
  realize as I embark on my latest Latino biography is this:
  Writing about Enrique Iglesias' favorite vegetable (lettuce)
  is meaningful.  Just like Howie D.'s dream to develop
  condominiums on the East Coast of Florida, LeAnn Rimes'
  plans to study speech pathology, and Leo's musings on
  celebrity ("Fame is like a VIP pass wherever you want to
  go").  Somebody out there actually cares about this stuff.
  Someone like Lan X. Le.
  Yours Forever
  You came into my life 
  Like an unexepted hurricane 
  You filled my life with music 
  You brought me life and joy 
  You stole my heart 
  Yet you don't realize that I'm here 
  Standing here, waiting for you.
  I love but not love in return 
  My life is fufilled 
  But my heart are empty 
  Come to me now 
  Make me yours and forever 
  Embrace me in your arms 
  We will soar together to place lover never went
  I will bring you love like no others 
  Give me a change to prove my love 
  Don't lock me out 
  Open your heart and let love in 
  I will be your moon, stars, and sun 
  I will be your everything 
  Make me your and forever.
  I know of your rejecting love 
  And it harden your heart
