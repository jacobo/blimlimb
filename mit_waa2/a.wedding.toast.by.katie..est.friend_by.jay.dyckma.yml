- Well, um, hi, everybody.
- |
  

- I'm Becky, Katie's oldest friend from Toledo.
- |
  

- It's just so great to be here celebrating Katie and Tom's marriage.
- |
  

- I mean, I can't believe it!
- |
  

- Tom Cruise!
- |
  

- I mean, I totally remember a picture of him she had hanging on her bedroom wall.
- |
  

- Well, I guess it was more of a side-column interview next to this totally HOT feature on Brad Pitt, but whatever.
- |
  

- Oh my God, we had such a crush on Brad!
- |
  

- Do you remember that, Katie?
- |
  

- Huh?
- |
  

- Oh, right, I mean, yeah, it was a really long time ago.
- And it's just so funny that you're marrying the guy from  Risky Business .
- |
  

- I mean, we didn't see it when it came out, being 5 and all, but we totally did rent the video.
- |
  

- "Or, actually, I think we tried to rent that Jared Leto movie\x97oh my God, Jordan Catalano!"
- |
  

- Blockbuster.
- |
  

- And, well, I guess it was Mrs. Holmes who rented  Risky Business , but we totally loved it!
- |
  

- Remember, Katie, it had Balki in it but without that weird accent?
- |
  

- Yeah, we laughed so hard about that.
- So, anyway, I'm really honored to be here as part of Katie's wedding party.
- |
  

- I've met so many great people.
- |
  

- And I'm so looking forward to meeting Tom at some point.
- |
  

- I mean, if he's anything like his publicist, I can just tell this is going to work out really well.
- |
  

- And it was super great meeting Jessica Rodriguez, Katie's new best friend, maid of honor, and, uh, spiritual adviser?
- |
  

- I mean, I don't remember Katie ever mentioning her before, but whatever.
- |
  

- And, you know, the bachelorette party was pretty fun, I guess.
- |
  

- "Well, I really would have never thought of Clearwater, Florida\x97I actually thought South Beach would have been awesome\x97but I guess it wasn't so bad."
- |
  

- Jessica said they had a great spa there and some really hot entertainment.
- |
  

- And, while I haven't been to too many spa resorts, I guess I enjoyed the self-actualization seminars and sleep-deprivation games.
- |
  

- And maybe the stripper did just get lost or something.
- |
  

- Oh, well.
- |
  

- Thanks again, Jessica!
- And it's just really great about Katie's involvement with that Scientology thing.
- |
  

- Hey, Katie, remember when we used to watch those dumb volcano commercials about it on TV?
- |
  

- Huh?
- |
  

- Well, um, we did.
- |
  

- And it's just so funny that you're into something scientific, 'cause we were both, like, so bad at science.
- |
  

- "Remember that Bunsen burner incident in 10th-grade lab\x97so not my fault\x97and then you pretended to make out with that fetal pig?"
- |
  

- And now you're totally into science.
- I mean, I should so become an Algebratologist or something.
- |
  

- Huh?
- |
  

- Oh, it's just a joke, Jessica, lighten up.
- But anyway, Katie's been really great explaining Scientology to me.
- |
  

- Oh, and you too, Jessica.
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- No, Jessica, I don't need another stress-test pamphlet.
- |
  

- Whatever.
- |
  

- So, apparently, there are these things called thetans that live inside you like alien parts or something and you try to, like, shed them.
- |
  

- Well, let's just hope the cameras don't add 10 thetans or anything!
- |
  

- Huh, what, Katie?
- |
  

- Oh, it was too funny.
- |
  

- Yeah, well, maybe Jessica just needs to chill out a bit.
- Finally, again, I'd like to apologize for crying inappropriately at times during the ceremony.
- |
  

- I've been off my meds for a few weeks and have had some trouble controlling my emotions lately.
- |
  

- But I totally think you were right, Katie, and I'm really better off now.
- |
  

- Yeah, it's just that at times I get a little dark.
- |
  

- Oh, well.
- |
  

- Hide the steak knives!
- |
  

- Hahahahaha.
- |
  

- I'm kidding.
- |
  

- I guess.
- So, a toast to the happy couple!
- |
  

- Nanoo nanoo, or whatever you people say.
- |
  

- OK, seriously, Jessica, get your hands off me.
- |
  

- It's a wedding, just let it go.
