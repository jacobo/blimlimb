- Dear Diary,
- Wow!
- |
  

- College is everything I thought it'd be.
- |
  

- Such diversity!
- |
  

- Jimmy, my roommate, went to school in a three-bedroom brick rambler, and Bobby and Robby, the guys across the hall, spent their senior year in a Dutch Colonial with a screened-in porch.
- |
  

- One guy even went to school in a condo!
- |
  

- I feel like I've been exposed to a whole new world.
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- I've given it a lot of thought, and I've decided to major in government.
- |
  

- There are so many great government classes in the course catalog!
- |
  

- As far as I can tell, you really need to be a government major to be part of the "in crowd" here.
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- My first college party!
- |
  

- A bunch of us got together last night at Bobby and Robby's room.
- |
  

- We cranked up the Amy Grant and drank more apple juice than I've ever had in my life.
- |
  

- Maybe it was the music, but after about 10 minutes we got so pumped up that we ran back to our rooms and called our parents.
- |
  

- A few people were hyperventilating.
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- I just received my schedule and I'm really excited.
- |
  

- "Here's what I'm taking:"
- |
  

- Government  11:00-11:50	Government  12:00-12:50	Government  13:00-13:50	Government  14:00-14:50	Government
- I'm a little worried about the late-afternoon class.
- |
  

- I hear it's tough.
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- The athletic programs here are excellent.
- |
  

- All the home-school sports are offered, and the competition is fierce (everyone at Patrick Henry was the best athlete at their home school).
- |
  

- I thought I was pretty good at running in circles in the backyard, but we've got some guys who just  fly  around the backyard.
- |
  

- One guy&#151;Timmy&#151;has this move where he spins as he runs and scoops up leaves and throws them over his head.
- |
  

- It's so awesome.
- |
  

- You can tell he spent a lot of time practicing.
- |
  

- I haven't seen our schedule yet, but I think we've got a great chance of going undefeated.
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- I sure am learning a lot about government.
- |
  

- Mistrusting the government, overthrowing the government, why the government is too intrusive unless it's restricting something you don't like&#151;college is opening up my mind to a lot of new ideas!
- |
  

- Did you know that the Constitution requires a separation of church and state?
- |
  

- I always thought this was something the public school kids made up.
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- I think I've met a girl I like!
- |
  

- Her name is Suzy, and she's a government major.
- |
  

- She graduated from a three-bedroom Victorian last fall, and her goal in life is to fulfill her parents' dreams.
- |
  

- I sit next to her in government class.
- |
  

- Every time I think about asking her out I get nervous.
- |
  

- I didn't feel this way when I asked Mom to my senior prom!
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- Don't have time to write&#151;I've got a big government exam tomorrow&#151;but guess what?
- |
  

- Suzy likes me!
- |
  

- We ate apple pie in the cafeteria and talked about government until 8:00 p.m.
- |
  

- Even better, both our parents signed our dating application and approval forms.
- |
  

- College life rules!
- |
  

- Dear Diary,
- Well, all my exams are over, and hard as it is to believe, tomorrow is graduation day.
- |
  

- Suzy and I have talked long and hard about our future together, and we've decided that after graduation we're going to pursue careers in government.
- |
  

- "Thanks to all our years in home-school, and our time here at the college, our mission, as we see it, is clear: To lobby Congress for legislation moving all forms of government into the home."
- |
  

- Assuming we get permission from our parents, of course.
