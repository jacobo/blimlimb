- "At the Check-out Counter:"
- "Cashier: Cash or credit today, sir?"
- "You: Cash?"
- |
  

- Credit?
- |
  

- Bah!
- |
  

- I challenge you to live dangerously!
- |
  

- Erect your cities beside Vesuvius!
- "Cashier: Whoa, Ken, I think you'd better double-bag this guy's eggs."

- "Greasy, Lecherous Parent with Hair Plugs: And handsome!"
- "Lonely Housewife: And blond!"
- "You: Heh heh."

- "At a Party:"
- "Partygoer #1: Nice party, eh?"
- "You: Because thou hast made danger thy calling, therefore shall I bury thee with my own hands!"

- Whaddaya say we head out with the boys and toss back a few brews?
- "You: Why, yes &#8212; let's indulge and revel in Dionysian bacchanalia!"
- "Co-worker #2: It's ironic that you say that, since '\"bacchanalia\" is derived from Bacchus, the Greek equivalent of Dionysius. Though fulfilling the same basic duties as deities, Greek Bacchus and Roman Dionysius are based on such uniquely disparate cultures that they resist intermingling. So, in essence, your prepositional object is a contradiction, albeit a long dead one."
- "Co-worker #1: Hahahaha, \"long dead,\" hahahaha &#8212; that's a good one, Steve."
