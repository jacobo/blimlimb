- I've always felt like part of the flock, but this shepherd really made me feel like an individual sheep.
- |
  

- I didn't  like it .
- |
  

- The worst shepherd ever!
- |
  

- You wouldn't believe how many times she lost us.
- |
  

- Be prepared to be left alone to come home on your own .
- |
  

- Trust me, there were no tails wagging.
- |
  

- Flock spirit sucks.
- |
  

- Bo-o-o-o-ring!
- |
  

- Like watching grass grow.
- |
  

- In fact, we did watch grass grow.
- |
  

- Total perv.
- |
  

- Always shearing us with his eyes.
- |
  

- Awesome shepherd!
- |
  

- He really makes you ruminate over the big issues.
- |
  

- Mary had a little lump.
- |
  

- Eww!
- |
  

- What is that on her neck!
- |
  

- Enough with the bad puns!
- |
  

- "We get it: ewe = you."
- |
  

- Ha ha ha (barf).
- |
  

- And every day it's "So who watched  Graze Anatomy  last night?
- "\" OMG!"
- |
  

- Awful hygiene, even for a shepherd.
- |
  

- Wears the same tunic, like, every day.
- |
  

- Made me sick to all four of my stomachs.
- |
  

- It's always "My goats did it this way" and "My goats would never do that.
- "\" Go herd goats then, idiot!"
- |
  

- I can't believe someone pays him for this.
- |
  

- Once, we found him under the haystack, fast asleep.
- |
  

- We peed on him.
- |
  

- Good times!
- |
  

- Sick!
- |
  

- I mean, what's with the Wile E. Coyote costume?
- |
  

- Not funny, man!
- |
  

- Clearly intimidated by the black sheep.
