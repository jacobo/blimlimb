  "WELCOME, NOEL"

Despite these tensions (or because of them?), Callas is splendid here &#151; tender, reverent, sweet. And those are just the hand gestures.

  "DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR?"
  "Indeed I do know what I hear," wrote critic Arturi Fendetz of this now beloved seasonal treasure, "and I do not care for it any more  than I did Renata Tebaldi's album of Mississippi prison blues." It should come as no surprise that Fendetz was later recognized as a philistine, deported by steamboat and, once home, made to denounce his mother, father and  fondness for sweetbreads at a sensational "show" trial. As for poor Maria, at this time she is undergoing tremendous stress in her personal life. Her voice makes something of a comeback after she accidentally swallows acupuncture needles, mistaking them for toothpicks. Then &#151; disaster. She is fired from the Metropolitan Opera after clashing with manager Sir Rudolf Bing over a new production of the "Ring" cycle. He expects her to go on as her own understudy in the long but vocally undemanding scene in which the Valkyries core apples. Callas simply refuses to attend rehearsal. She stays in her hotel suite bleaching yellowed press clippings in the bathroom sink, playing her old recordings on the mechanical pianaforte and in general bemoaning life. "Meanwhile" (as opera buffs like to say) Onassis is planning fresh heartbreak. In the years since he has grown from mere magnet shipper to shipping magnate, his ego also has grown out of control. Not satisfied with a great yet aging diva who is only too happy to lend him her chignon, Onassis now is determined to woo away and win the hand of some world leader's wife. Out on the yacht he already is entertaining actress Monica Viti &#151; only eight weeks after her wedding to Paul VI.
