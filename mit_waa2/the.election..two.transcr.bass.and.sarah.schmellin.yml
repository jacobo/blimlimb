  JA: But why is Jesse Jackson talking?
  TJ: They say he is saying that police with flashing lights have stopped the
  black people from voting.
  JA: What?
  TJ: The black people could not stuff the boxes because the flashing lights
  were frightening and sounded hard. (Taarnvang returns on screen). Now she
  says the old are confused because the lines of Gore and of a third person
  were very very near. They put the holes for the third person and not for

  JA: Does that mean he won?
  TJ: No, he is saying this because the counting was counted again. He says
  the underneath president called him to say his celebration, but then said no
  that he would like for more counting. (a map of the United States appears)
  JA (who is from Portland): Why is Oregon flashing?
  TJ: There is no deciding there. They do not know the winners and cannot do
