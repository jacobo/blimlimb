- "\"Hello, Michael?"
- |
  

- Hey, these guys here don't believe I know you.
- |
  

- Tell them I know you, Michael.
- |
  

- Tell them how I know you.
- |
  

- We go so far back.
- |
  

- Like centuries back.
- |
  

- Remember that time I beat you in a race.
- |
  

- That was crazy, Michael.
- |
  

- We were doggy-paddling to that inflatable raft and I beat you.
- |
  

- I beat Michael Phelps.
- |
  

- We were the best in that class.
- |
  

- No one was better at swimming with the giant noodles than me and you.
- |
  

- Everyone else was like a guppy, but me and you, we were like sharks.
- |
  

- Sharks, Michael.
- |
  

- Sharks.
- |
  

- "Michael\x97are you there?"
- |
  

- Mike?
- "\"This is Papa John's."
- |
  

- How can I help you?
- "\"Help me?"
- |
  

- No, no, Michael, I want to help you.
- |
  

- I remember your mom telling my mom that you were really bummed out when I quit training.
- |
  

- I got bronchitis, then I missed a few weeks, then I just stopped coming, then I took up clarinet.
- |
  

- "I don't know if my heart was in it back then\x97but it is now."
- |
  

- I'm ready to get back in the pool and get training again.
- |
  

- I think you should move here, and me and you can train at the YMCA by my apartment.
- |
  

- It'll be great.
- |
  

- The Chinese better watch out in 2009, 'cause we're gonna bring it, me and you, breaking record after record.
- |
  

- I can see it now.
- |
  

- Our relay team will be the best.
- |
  

- Maybe we can go out for pizza after, like back in the day.
- |
  

- Remember how my dad would drive us to get pizza after training?
- |
  

- That was fun.
- "\"Yes\x97pizza ."
- |
  

- What kind would you like?
- "\"You used to blow soda out your nose."
- |
  

- That was funny, man.
- |
  

- You gotta come to my birthday next week.
- |
  

- Like, I insist.
- |
  

- I'm turning the big two-four.
- |
  

- You probably want my address.
- |
  

- It's 510 Dockery Street, fifth floor, apartment 12B.
- |
  

- Just go to the fifth floor and look for the door with balloons on it.
- |
  

- Those balloons are for you.
- |
  

- Like, everyone else knows where my apartment is, but I'm putting up those balloons for you, man.
- |
  

- I'm gonna get, like, an inflatable pool, and you can race my friends and put on demos or something.
- |
  

- Do you want to come, Michael?
- |
  

- Do you?
- "\"My name isn't Michael, it's Greg."
- |
  

- But, yes, I'd love to come.
- |
  

- No one's ever invited me to anything before.
- |
  

- They think just because I answer the phones at Papa John's I'm some kind of worthless middleman, but I like hanging out, too.
- |
  

- "I'm a real\x97\""
- "\"Yeah, Michael, you're real."
- |
  

- You're the real deal.
- |
  

- You're the  realest  deal.
- |
  

- How many medals did you win, like 30?
- |
  

- "Watch your back in '09\x97I might take some of those away."
- "\"What time should I come over?"
- "\"USA!"
- |
  

- USA!
- |
  

- USA!
- |
  

- USA!
- "\"Should I bring anything?"
- "\"Yeah, Michael, we're gonna bring it in '09."
- |
  

- Can you wear flippers in the pool?
- |
  

- If you can, I don't get why the other swimmers don't.
- |
  

- I can swim sooo fast with my flippers.
- |
  

- Maybe I'll wear one of those shark fins, like in the movies, and everyone will be freaking out.
- |
  

- But it could make them swim faster, unless they think I'm a dolphin and want to come over and pet me and ride me and stuff.
- |
  

- Do dolphins have fins?
- |
  

- Where do you buy those fins?
- |
  

- Target?
- |
  

- I have an idea.
- |
  

- Let's go halfsies on a place downtown, our bachelor pad.
- |
  

- Some of those chicks on your team are hot.
- |
  

- We should invite them over.
- |
  

- Do you know LeBron James?
- |
  

- I always wanted to meet him.
- |
  

- You probably know him.
- |
  

- Or maybe you don't.
- |
  

- Either way, I think you should invite him to our housewarming.
- |
  

- OK, it's late, and I'm gonna go check out some places downtown.
- |
  

- Scout out the area.
- |
  

- I'll call you tomorrow.
- |
  

- I hope these guys believe me now.
- |
  

- Remember that time I beat you in a race.
- |
  

- Oh, man, we had some great times.
- |
  

- Someone should make a movie about our friendship.
- |
  

- I want you to be the best man at my wedding.
- |
  

- "Remember, birthday next week\x97pi\xF1ata, inflatable pool, chocolate cake."
- |
  

- USA!
- |
  

- USA!
- |
  

- USA!
- |
  

- I love you, man!
- "\"I love you, too."
- |
  

- Also, I hope there aren't any peanuts in the cake, because I'm allergic.
- |
  

- Most people don't realize that some chocolate contains traces of peanuts.
- "\"For you, Michael, I'd put chlorine in the cake."
- |
  

- I'd dress it in a Speedo.
- |
  

- I'd cover it in gold.
- |
  

- Just come to my bar mitzvah.
