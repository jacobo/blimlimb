- All right.
- |
  

- Here we go.
- |
  

- Wedding song.
- |
  

- Wedding song.
- |
  

- Something epic.
- |
  

- Big song for the biggest day of my life.
- |
  

- An anthem.
- |
  

- No half-assed "You're My Best Friend.
- "\" Bigger."
- |
  

- "\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\""
- |
  

- What am I saying?
- |
  

- Queen?
- |
  

- Sorry, guys, just because you write one long song doesn't make you progressive.
- |
  

- "I mean, that would make \"Stairway to Heaven\" progressive. Yeah, right. Hey, Robert Plant\x97you're not fooling anyone with those Tolkien-based lyrics. Frodo wouldn't \"ramble on."
- All right then.
- |
  

- Wedding.
- |
  

- Love.
- |
  

- Eternal love.
- |
  

- Undying love.
- |
  

- Love is stronger than death.
- |
  

- "\"Great Gig in the Sky\""
- |
  

- No, that's just about death.
- |
  

- How about "Close to the Edge"? That's about suicide, but in an uplifting way. Wait. I've lost myself.
- Emerson, Lake & Palmer.
- |
  

- They must have a love song.
- |
  

- "\"Karn Evil 9\""
- |
  

- That's an epic.
- |
  

- And recorded in just one take!
- |
  

- "Ooh, even better: \"Lucky Man\"! Yes. \"Lucky Man."
- "\" It's my wedding day and I'm a lucky man!"
- |
  

- Perfect.
- |
  

- Oh, wait.
- |
  

- That's about death, too.
- OK, OK.
- |
  

- How about something with nature?
- |
  

- Something pastoral.
- |
  

- Katie likes picnics and stuff.
- |
  

- Rush?
- |
  

- "\"The Trees\""
- |
  

- "\"There is unrest in the forest."
- |
  

- There is trouble with the trees.
- |
  

- For the maples need more sunlight and the oaks ignore their pleas.
- "\" Hmm."
- |
  

- Almost.
- |
  

- But people probably won't understand it's a  metaphor .
- |
  

- Damn, Alex Lifeson is an underrated guitarist.
- How about Jethro Tull?
- |
  

- They have some nature stuff.
- |
  

- No, no.
- |
  

- I'd have to explain for like the millionth time that Jethro Tull is  a band, not a person .
- |
  

- Geez, people, his name is fucking Ian Anderson.
- |
  

- Besides, songs about wood sprites might not be romantic enough.
- "\"Roundabout\""
- |
  

- "\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\""
- |
  

- "\"Games People Play\""
- |
  

- No, no, no.
- |
  

- A marriage consecrated by the Alan Parsons Project will end in divorce.
- |
  

- I read that somewhere.
- |
  

- Moody Blues?
- |
  

- Yeah, "Nights in White Satin"! No, all my friends are using that these days. It's getting worse than the chicken dance.
- Genesis is good.
- |
  

- Peter Gabriel Genesis.
- |
  

- Katie thought she was being helpful when she suggested "You'll Be in My Heart," because it's Phil Collins. But it's Phil Collins  solo , Katie. And it's Disney, for Christ's sake. The pinnacle of suck. (Although I admire  Fantasia 's combination of Celtic demon mythology with Mussorgsky's  Night on Bald Mountain .) But still. The theme song from  Tarzan ? Good Lord. How can I marry this woman? She doesn't even own any songs in 5/4.
- "Maybe I should just pick a song that reflects our wedding theme: The Wizard's Role in an Android-Based Society."
- |
  

- Hmmm .
- |
  

- An instrumental might be the best bet.
- |
  

- Something fuguelike, with a scripted 15-minute guitar solo.
- |
  

- The guitar is the wizard, and the rest of us are obviously androids.
- |
  

- "The guitar will serenade my bride and me, and we'll be swirling within arpeggios and grace notes\x97the center of Energy as Sound."
- |
  

- Then Katie's mother will complain about the volume.
- |
  

- I know it.
- This shouldn't be that hard.
- |
  

- Maybe I'm getting cold feet.
- |
  

- It occurs to me that tradition, my future mother-in-law, and the videographer all expect us to dance together.
- |
  

- I don't know how to dance, and I deride those who do.
- |
  

- I'll be mocked by all my best friends, including members of L.H.
- O.
- |
  

- Yes cover band, Lonely Heart Owners).
- Katie keeps reminding me that planning a wedding is all about compromise.
- |
  

- And I agree that I don't necessarily have to approve the engineering specs for the wedding cake.
- |
  

- I mean, it's enough that it's in the shape of the E.L.
- O.
- |
  

- Katie did say Sting.
- |
  

- Sting would be about compromise the way carrot cake is about compromise.
- |
  

- A dessert no one could possibly want, just to have dessert.
- |
  

- I mean, I do respect that he decided to do "I Hung My Head" in 9/8 just to confuse the Memphis Horns, but how can I trust anyone with that kind of commercial success? If it's Sting, it has to be a B side. Maybe something unreleased.
- Maybe "Saint Augustine in Hell.
- "\" I know Sting's got a good line in there somewhere."
- |
  

- What is it?
- |
  

- "Oh, yeah: \""
- The minute I saw her face, the second I caught her eye, the minute I touched the flame, I knew it would never die.
- "\" Yeah, that's pretty good."
- |
  

- "Oh, wait, this line's even better: \""
- Blessed St.
- |
  

- Theresa, the whore of Babylon, Madonna, and my mother all rolled into one.
- "\" Yep."
- |
  

- That's a keeper.
- |
  

- Compromise.
- |
  

- I wonder if it's too late to get that emblazoned on the cocktail napkins.
