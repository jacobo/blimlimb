- I have been asked to say a few words about Superbad, a book by a fresh new voice in elegant, literary, sometimes humorous writing, in part because I am that fresh new voice.
- |
  

- If I were asked to say some introductory words about me, I would say that I have, in my long years as a human being, learned that funny people are not necessarily funny writers, just as people are not necessarily writers.
- |
  

- If I could distill my decades of experience into a single lesson, it would not be that.
- |
  

- "It would probably be this: Look out!"
- "Through the ages, many great men have studied the mechanics of comedy: Henri Bergson, me."
- |
  

- Bergson believed that repetition was one of the principal sources of humor, and that exaggeration was another.
- |
  

- I believe that repetition is one of the principal sources of humor, and that Bergson criminally underestimated the role of exaggeration.
- |
  

- We differ on other important points as well.
- |
  

- Bergson was French, and I am assuming he had a long beard that contained mice and other vermin.
- |
  

- I am an American, and my beard contains only mice.
- Perhaps an example will make this clearer.
- |
  

- The other day, I received a humor piece from a young humor writer named Michael Edson who wrote to me requesting my help.
- |
  

- I agreed to read the piece and offer a short critique.
- |
  

- "And then it occurred to me: Why not stage the critique as part of this introduction, so that all of my readers can learn a little something about how humor operates?"
- The premise of Edson's piece is simple.
- |
  

- As a result of a mix-up, the renowned soul singer James Brown has become the President of the United States.
- |
  

- The Funky President, if you will.
- |
  

- "The piece opens in an imaginary cabinet meeting in the early days of the Brown Administration:"
- "Secretary of Education: We need to do more about education."
- "President Brown: Sometimes I feel so good, I got to jump back and kiss myself."
- |
  

- Heh!
- "Secretary of the Interior: But what about the environment?"
- "President Brown: You got to get over before you get under."
- |
  

- Heh!
- "Secretary of Defense: This most recent Chinese crisis worries me."
- "President Brown: Pass the peas, pass the peas."
- |
  

- Heh!
- This is what is known as a one-joke joke.
- |
  

- In Mr. Edson's piece, President Brown isn't as smart as his advisers.
- |
  

- He isn't capable of understanding the very real problems that face the nation.
- |
  

- He is incoherent, and merely repeats lyrics from his best-known songs.
- |
  

- I hesitate to call a young humorist to account for what is obviously a first draft, but I must say that this shoddy, vaguely racist piece appalls me.
- |
  

- This is not a good piece.
- |
  

- It's not even a bad piece.
- |
  

- It is superbad.
- How can we make it better?
- |
  

- Well, for starters, I would recommend changing the premise so that James Brown is not the President of the United States, but rather the coach of the American biathlon team.
- |
  

- The biathlon, of course, is an Olympic event that combines skiing and shooting, and consequently it is inherently humorous.
- |
  

- Once Mr. Brown has been moved to the biathlon team, then I would recommend that Mr. Edson think long and hard about what mishaps might befall Mr. Brown in his newfound life of skiing and shooting.
- |
  

- "For example, Mr. Brown could trip over a pair of skis and, as he falls, say \"Oooo-eeeee\" the way he does in songs sometimes. He could drink a hot beverage and burn his tongue, therefore making it difficult if not impossible to sing without sounding marble-mouthed. Or else he could put on all his clothes backward and ski up the mountain. (This brings to mind Bergson's other tenet: \"Backwards clothes and uphill skiing are gold."
- "\") Whatever the scenario&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and it would not be fair for me to overdirect this revision&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;it is vital to do more than think about the situation from the outside."
- |
  

- Going inside the joke results in a richer joke.
- |
  

- Feeling your way through your characters, even in the shortest piece, results in richer characters.
- |
  

- And remember, Mr. Edson, compassion is not a dirty word.
- |
  

- Unlike "
- |
  

- Not all the pieces in Superbad are humorous.
- |
  

- Some, in fact, are quite sad.
- |
  

- "The reason for this is simple: what is sad is also what is funny."
- |
  

- Though this aphorism sounds like a hollow bit of sophistry, I cannot stress it enough.
- |
  

- I could write it in capital letters forty feet high and still feel that I had underplayed my hand.
- |
  

- Sad situations are some of the funniest things around.
- |
  

- Say, for example, that a young woman lives in a high-rise apartment building with her boyfriend and their two-year-old daughter.
- |
  

- Say that the boyfriend has recently struck up an affair with an ex-girlfriend of his who lives in the same high-rise apartment building.
- |
  

- Say that the young woman who is the story's central protagonist dreams of murdering her romantic rival.
- |
  

- Say that the young woman does in fact murder her romantic rival, inviting her over for what she says will be a polite conversation and then running her through with a kitchen knife, afterwards dragging her body into a hall closet and wrapping it in a bedsheet.
- |
  

- Say that the two-year-old daughter of the murderess sits in the kitchen in her high-chair, in the high-rise apartment building, squalling, her face as red as blood.
- |
  

- Say that the boyfriend returns home.
- |
  

- "\"Honey,\""
- |
  

- "\"I think the baby dropped her pacifier."
- This is a moment of exquisite comedy; it would take me hours to list all the ways in which is it superior to a clown, or a pie in the face.
- I will list them while you read.
- |
  

- When you are done, if you would like a copy of the list, please send me an email.
- |
  

- I will do my best to fulfill your request.
- |
  

- A man I have known for many years was recently hospitalized with what doctors thought was a fatal disease, but which turned out to be a simple matter of shoes that were two sizes too small.
- |
  

- Nevertheless, the experience changed him profoundly.
- |
  

- He went from being a meek sort, the kind of man who would give you a dollar if you looked at him sternly, to a man who would hoard his dollars and instead dispense a steady stream of opinions.
- |
  

- The other day, he called me on the phone.
- |
  

- "\"You have a terrible haircut,\""
- |
  

- "\"It makes you look like an inmate in an Italian women's prison."
- |
  

- Also, your bedsheets are ridiculous; an adult should not be sleeping on linens with pictures of the characters from Fat Albert.
- |
  

- And it is apparent to me that your head is too large for the rest of your body.
- "\" I tell you: this new assertiveness of his was almost like a disease."
- To distract him, I asked him what he thought of Superbad, a copy of which I had messengered to him as he lay in the hospital, terrified of the Cramped-Toe Syndrome that he was certain would take his life.
- "\"I liked it,\""
- |
  

- "\"More or less."
- |
  

- I should say, though, that I found the whole enterprise formally scattershot.
- |
  

- Here, there's a traditional narrative.
- |
  

- There, a piece of witty metafiction.
- |
  

- It's rather like flipping the channels on a telly.
- |
  

- Bloody smashing, but it gets you all narked.
- "\" (He's British."
- |
  

- Did I mention that?
- |
  

- My friend was right, of course.
- |
  

- He is dead now&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;on his way home from buying new, roomier shoes, he went under the wheels of a bus&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;but when he was alive, he was righter than right.
- |
  

- The pieces in Superbad occupy a wide range of shapes and sizes, like the instruments in an orchestra.
- |
  

- But I would urge readers to recognize that the themes played upon these instruments are similar, and that the intent is to produce a sweet music that makes ample use of harmony and composition.
- |
  

- "The stories, almost to the last, are concerned with the following six topics:     Originality  Pain  Power  Letter-Writing  Mortality  Obsessive List-Making"
- Other minor themes, too numerous to list completely, include Italy, Russia, obesity, sexual shame, dogs, dreams, people's hair, and the inner workings of language itself.
- Though I have no doubt streamlined things with this easy-to-use List of Themes, I feel that I must say a few words about reading.
- |
  

- Writing a book is hard, yes.
- |
  

- It is back-breaking work.
- |
  

- If you are a young man when you start writing a book, you are an old man by the time you finish.
- |
  

- In fact, there is only one thing harder than writing a book, and that is reading a book.
- |
  

- I do not say this unctuously, as a sop to those who have purchased my book and are about to undertake the nearly superhuman task of reading it, for which they should be admired.
- |
  

- I say it because it is true.
- |
  

- Creating is hard, but responding correctly to the creation of another is nearly impossible.
- |
  

- Studies have shown that more than ninety percent of all college graduates cannot fully understand even a simple sentence such as "The dog walked up a hill, and then ran for president.
- "\" If you are one of the lucky few, if you have managed to master the devilishly difficult art of reading, I have only one request for you: teach others to do what you have done."
- |
  

- Make sure some of them are children, because teaching children always seems noble.
- |
  

- Also, do not vote for the dog.
- |
  

- His economic plan is terrible.
