- Dear Mr. Superman, Mr. Batman, Ms. Wonder Woman, and other esteemed do-gooders,
- Although I have been waiting patiently for a few years in the hope that an advertisement would appear, I feel for the sake of my career that now is a good time to approach you.
- |
  

- In essence, I am wondering whether you are, or will be, accepting any new members into your fine organization.
- |
  

- More specifically, I am inquiring as to whether you need the services of a geneticist, since that is my particular field of expertise.
- "Part of the reason I am contacting you now is that I suspect you are possibly hurt by the unwarranted waning in public interest associated with your group, a symptom that likely correlates to the soaring popularity of some of your competitors\x97the X-Men and Spider-Man, to name two."
- "Anyway, this is why I think I can help\x97as a geneticist, I can bring a lot to the table."
- |
  

- To me, it's no coincidence that the X-Men, Spider-Man, and the like are mostly a consequence of fortuitous genetic modification.
- More specifically, my knowledge in genetics can directly tackle your weaknesses.
- |
  

- For instance, current genetic technologies could be utilized to offset Mr. Superman's annoying kryptonite problem.
- |
  

- Whether it's the result of something specific in  his  genetic makeup or the result of the rest of society having some sort of innate immunity, the issue at stake is a difference in biological makeup.
- |
  

- This, of course, makes it a perfect candidate for targeted gene therapy.
- Mr. Batman could also benefit greatly from a genetic analysis.
- |
  

- I would not be surprised if his manic-depressive tendencies are hard to manage and counterproductive to the group as a whole.
- |
  

- Here we can perform a few diagnostic genetic tests, which can then go to great lengths to effectively pinpoint and manage these potentially bothersome tendencies.
- Even Ms. Wonder Woman could stand to gain from my genetic expertise.
- |
  

- Clearly, engaging in intensive hand-to-hand combat with her sizable chest is problematic.
- |
  

- "But how exactly would you perform breast-reduction surgery\x97or any surgery, for that matter\x97when an individual's magic bracelets are constantly maneuvering to defend against an incoming scalpel?"
- |
  

- "My point is that you don't have to\x97I may be able to do something about this by using current genetic-manipulation methodologies."
- And just imagine what could be done with cloning.
- |
  

- The mind reels, does it not?
- Now, with respect to fighting crime, I think that, overall, it wouldn't take much effort to transform me into a fully functional Superfriend.
- |
  

- I already have a well-equipped laboratory facility, which, with your help, could easily be relocated to the appropriate underground cave, glacier, secret island, or space station.
- As for a costume, I own several lab coats, which, when worn with a good pair of spandex pants, will, I'm sure, sufficiently instill some semblance of fear into those who choose to do battle with me.
- |
  

- I would offer to wear some retro-looking goggles as well, but, unfortunately, I need my prescription glasses, and, well, contacts tend to make my eyes itch.
- Although I can't fly, and I don't own anything close to resembling a Batmobile or an invisible jet, I do drive around in one of those stylish yet practical Mazda MPVs.
- |
  

- "If you recall, this is Mazda's very popular minivan model (you know\x97zoom zoom!"
- |
  

- I to paint some lightning bolts or DNA strands on its sides.
- Also, if it helps, I know quite a few physicists who may be able to lend a hand with Ms. Wonder Woman's embarrassing "the jet is invisible but I'm clearly not" situation.
