- Goat on the Railroad Tracks
- Do not send us your second- or third-best poem.

- We want your favored son, your bright-shining diamond, your sacrificial goat on the railroad tracks of our pages.
- Leave the Cannoli
- We might or might not be interested in poems about clandestine Italian-American business culture in northeastern New Jersey, and we may, or may not, want to publish those poems in a journal that might be called  Leave the Cannoli  and that we, whoever we are, may or may not be responsible for editing.

- Feel free to simultaneously submit, but if we decide to take your poem, we'll meet you at the docks behind the Lucky Fish Factory at 4 a.m.
- |
  

- Come alone.
- |
  

- With your poem.
- Road Rage Review
- We're looking for work that evokes the truly American feeling of being rear-ended at a busy intersection, emerging from the car like a Greek god, pulling the cocksucker from the front seat of his BMW, ripping open his pelvis, and savagely gnawing on his shrunken prostate.
- So Straight!
- So Straight!
- |
  

- We want poems that evoke the back seat of a Toyota Camry, the awkward armrests at a suburban movie theater, screaming fights in the dressing room of a J.Crew outlet, text messaging, Starbucks, and John Cougar Mellencamp.
- Southern Aquitane Hill
- Between Cottonwood Avenue
- |
  

- Street Review
- No profanity or graphic material.
- |
  

- No sex.
- |
  

- No children's poems.
- |
  

- No scenes with children learning life lessons alongside other children.
- |
  

- No nostalgic poems, nor poems that depict a dark apocalyptic future wherein humans are controlled by fascist robots (although that certainly will be the case).
- |
  

- In general, we are not interested in poems that explain how people die in gruesome and all too realistic ways, nor do we want poems that hold true love in the highest regard.
- |
  

- We do not accept rhymed, formal, free-verse, or prose poems.
- |
  

- Response time varies according to the quality of the submission.
- |
  

- Sixteen pages, bound with silk, and printed on the skin of a lion.
- |
  

- Appears once every Democratic presidential administration.

- No simultaneous submissions, please.
- Spilled Milk
- We publish poetry that makes us weep.
- |
  

- Give us dead puppies, single mothers, and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches with the crusts cut off.

- Show us headless dolls and lonely circus workers after dark.
- |
  

- Take us to kickball games where an overweight child is selected last, or perhaps not at all.
