- First Memory.
- The ball came at him harder each time.
- |
  

- He let it bounce off his chest.
- |
  

- When it landed on the ground at his feet, he kicked it to the boy nearest him.
- "\"Catch it,\""
- |
  

- But, again, he let the ball hit off his chest and fall to the ground.
- |
  

- He dribbled it with his feet, toeing it carefully to keep it in front of him, until one of the other boys took the ball from him and set it down a few feet away.
- |
  

- "\"Pick it up with your hands,\""
- |
  

- "\"No,\""
- |
  

- Footboy.
- |
  

- "\"I won't use my hands."
- |
  

- The New Doctor.
- "\"From day one he hasn't used his hands,\""
- |
  

- "\"The nurse brought him to me, put him to my breast, and his feet came up and took hold of me."
- |
  

- It was funny.
- |
  

- All the other mothers crowded around my bed at feeding time, just to watch.
- |
  

- We all laughed.
- The doctor looked at him through his glasses, which were dusty.
- |
  

- The look on his face says, "Let's make friends.
- "\"He's getting older,\""
- |
  

- "\"What kind of life is it to do everything with your feet when God gave you two good hands?"
- |
  

- Look at his skinny arms, just hanging down.
- |
  

- They're like rope.
- He worked his right foot out of its shoe and brought it to his face, rubbing under his nose.
- |
  

- The doctor's eyes followed the foot back into the shoe.
- "\"Can you believe it,\""
- |
  

- Trying to Sleep.
- The weights the doctor fastened to his wrists came off easily.
- |
  

- He placed them on the small table beside his bed and lay down to take a nap.
- |
  

- He told himself there are no bones in his arms and hands, but he saw the X-rays and now knows otherwise.
- He closed his eyes.
- |
  

- "There's a dream he had been having lately where he doesn't have any arms: the sleeves of his shirt are rolled neatly to the shoulder and pinned."
- |
  

- He tried to put himself back into that happy dream, but the voice of the new doctor kept him awake.
- "\"You're really missing out on a lot,\""
- |
  

- "\"There's no medical reason why you should not use your hands."
- |
  

- You're only limiting yourself.
- "But he was sure he could do with his feet all the things the rest of the world did with their hands: he could peel an orange, sharpen a pencil, put a cassette in his tape deck, open a can of soda, use a telephone &#151; both touchtone and rotary."
- |
  

- He could ride a bike, kill flies, and even tie his own shoes, though he always had to tied them before putting them on.
- |
  

- His penmanship was legible, he kept his room picked up, he made good grades.
- |
  

- What was the problem, finally?
- |
  

- The New Girl.
- In the school cafeteria, the new girl sat down directly across from him.
- |
  

- She had on a white sweater, a plaid skirt and glasses.
- |
  

- Her name, he knew, was Beth.
- |
  

- Smiling at him, she asked, "Is this seat taken?
- He looked up from the book he was reading.
- |
  

- "\"No.\""
- Beth sat.
- As he read, he brought his right foot to the side of his head, tugged at his ear, licked his big toe, and then turned the page of his book.
- |
  

- He continued reading for a short time, then looked up to see that Beth was having trouble opening her milk.
- "\"Let me get that for you,\""
- |
  

- He opened the carton and set it back down on the table in front of her.
- Beth thanked him, and he said she was welcome.
- After a moment his reading was interrupted by a tap on his right foot.
- |
  

- Without looking up, he returned the tap and let his foot linger beside Beth's then move a few inches up the inside of her calf.
- |
  

- He gave her a little toe pinch.
- |
  

- She bounced in her seat and laughed.
- |
  

- "\"How'd you do that?"
- "\" she asked."
- "\"What?"
- "\" he said."
- |
  

- He gave her another small pinch, "
- That?
- She laughed again, then slipped her feet out of their shoes and gave him a toe pinch.
- "\"I didn't even feel that,\""
- |
  

- He told her there's a trick to it.
- |
  

- "\"You have to give it a little twist when you squeeze."
- He watched her face squint in concentration as her toes took hold of the flesh just above his ankle.
- |
  

- She gave him a squeeze and then a twist.
- "\"Ouch,\""
- |
  

- He bounced in his seat and laughed.
- "\"I owe you one,\""
- |
  

- "\"Truce,\""
- |
  

- She nodded her head and said, "I will if you will.
- Their feet met again under the table.
- |
  

- Their toes interlaced and locked.
- |
  

- Their soles pressed together, her heels fitting snugly into his arches.
- He thought he could do that all day.
