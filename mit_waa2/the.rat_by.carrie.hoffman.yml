- The rat rumbled through the kitchen, eating everything he could find.
- |
  

- The rat ate our peanut butter and popcorn.
- |
  

- The rat ate our cereal and pretzels.
- |
  

- Then he ate our oatmeal and assorted nuts.
- |
  

- The rat ate simply anything.
- |
  

- We set out several traps but none worked.
- |
  

- The traps were too small, and the rat was too smart.
- |
  

- He ate the bait and kept moving.
- The rat didn't fit under the kitchen cabinets, where the other vermin lived, so he sat on our couch with his tail dangling off the plaid cushion.
- |
  

- He munched on our baked lays and diet cookies and complained bitterly, unceasingly, about our low-fat food products.
- "\"We are obese,\""
- |
  

- "\"And unhealthy."
- |
  

- It's either the diet snacks or gastric bypass.
- The rat gave my husband the finger.
- "\"I still want the bypass,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- My friend at work had it done.
- |
  

- For lunch she eats half a cracker and is full.
- |
  

- She lost twenty-five pounds in one week.
- "\"You want surgery, and I want a milkshake,\""
- |
  

- "\"I'm glad we don't have a child,\""
- |
  

- "\"What with this rat around, and our obesity."
- |
  

- What would a child think?
- "\"Oh, it would be okay,\""
- |
  

- "\"You could get the kid a dog, that would keep him busy."
- |
  

- A dog is a nice animal.
- My husband started crying then.
- |
  

- He had his face in his hands.
- |
  

- I was pregnant once, but lost the baby.
- |
  

- Sometimes my husband got emotional about it.
- The rat placed his paw on my husband's back and patted him.
- |
  

- He went over to the stereo and turned on some adult contemporary music.
- "\"You two need to rekindle your romance,\""
- |
  

- He urged my husband off the couch.
- "\"Why don't you dance with her?"
- "\" the rat said to him."
- |
  

- "\"Go on, put your arms around her."
- My husband stretched his arms and wrapped them around my back.
- |
  

- He stroked my hair.
- |
  

- We moved around the living room to the sounds of a piano.
- The rat watched for a while and then huffed off to the kitchen, always scavenging.
