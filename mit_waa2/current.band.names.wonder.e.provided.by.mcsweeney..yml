  Part One: "Bullets for Pussy."
  There is a punk-rock band with the name "Bullets for Pussy." Its meaning
  is elusive. This writer will be examining the band's name in this space, which will follow what I've just been saying, and will go on from here,
  after this sentence.
  "Bullets for Pussy." Is the exchange implied in this name in the form of
  bullets for sex? This writer doesn't know much about guns, but I imagine
  bullets aren't too expensive, so in this case it would be a good trade
  for the one receiving the sex. Unless, though, the bullets were those
  armor-piercing ones with the mercury in the tip -- those are expensive.
  Then it would be a more fair trade. Or if it were a large quantity of
  bullets, then the trade would also be fair.
  Then there's the question of who would need bullets, in what seems to be
  quite a pinch. My guess is that it's a woman offering the "pussy" side
  of the bargain. But why would this woman need bullets so quickly that
  she would have to sell herself in exchange for them? After all, in the
  time it takes to have sex, she could have run to the store and  bought 
  the bullets. Unless she had no money or was not near a store.
  Unfortunately, there simply is not enough information in the title for a
  cut-and-dried answer.
  Yet another frustrating tangent is that due to the fact that the woman
  needs bullets, logically, one would assume that the woman is in battle.
  But hold on! you say. Women aren't allowed into combat. The U.S. allows
  women to hold numerous military positions, but none require firing
  weaponry in combat (thereby necessitating the bullets). All very true,
  but who said anything about the U.S.? The Israeli army allows and maybe
  even requires females to be in the military for a certain period of
  time, and in front-line combat roles. Following this route of thinking,
  however, inevitably leads one down several open-ended roads which maybe
  too obscure to even consider.
  But even the above leaves untouched the options that the female is some
  sort of freedom-fighter-urban-guerilla type who is using her feminine
  wiles to obtain scarce ammo, or a secret agent who sleeps with foreign
  high-ups in order to get her hands on the new, high-tech bullets
  destined for outlaw nations. Then again, we have to consider the
  possibility that maybe it's a violent person who is trading his or her
  pet cat for the bullets. This seems implausible, but we would be making
  a mistake in underestimating the depths violent people would sink to,
  especially if they needed bullets.
  One is almost wont to throw up one's arms at the sheer complexity of it
  all!
  It is in consideration of this that I have regrouped and put together
  the following notes outlining the major non-silly or non-obscure
  postulates we have come up with for the name to this point:
  
  	 - Probability that "Pussy" = "sex": Likely
  - Probability that "Pussy" = "cat": Less likely due to the lascivious
  thinking generally associated with "punk-rock" bands, but cannot be
  ruled out
  - Probability that "Pussy" in question is owned by or a part of a
  woman: high
  - Probability that "Pussy" in question is owned by or a part of a
  hermaphrodite: lower due to the world's female-to-hermaphrodite ratio,
  but again cannot be ruled out in deference to punk-rock bands
  - Possible occupations of said woman (in order of descending
  probability):
  - Israeli soldier
  - Freedom fighter
  - Carol Channing
  - Super spy
  - None of the above
  Even after all of this, I still find the possible explanations somehow
  unsatisfying and am secretly sure there is something else out there,
  some other reason for the name. Please rest assured that I will exhaust
  all options and leave no stone unturned in pursuit of an explanation.
  Thanks to the exploding technology advances in communications I have
  already formed an internet chat group to address the subject. Feel free
  to write for updates or with possible explanations. It is all much
  appreciated.
