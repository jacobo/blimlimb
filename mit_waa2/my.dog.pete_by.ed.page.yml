- I was sitting out on the porch with my dog Pete.

- A breathtaking sunset was streaked across the sky and it had put me in a reflective mood.
- "\"You know, Pete,\""
- |
  

- I said.

- "\"I've been thinking about salads."
- Pete looked at me, one ear cocked slightly higher than the other.
- "\"When you hear the word 'salad,' you instantly think of lettuce, right?"
- |
  

- But what about fruit salad?
- |
  

- And potato salad?
- |
  

- It makes me think that a salad is really just a jumble of different foods, regardless of whether lettuce is involved.
- From the look on Pete's face I could almost believe he was intrigued.
- "\"But what about soup, Pete?"
- |
  

- By that definition, aren't soups nothing more than hot liquid salads?
- For a second, it looked like Pete was going to say something.
- |
  

- But, of course, he didn't.
- |
  

- He's a dog.
- |
  

- He simply leaned back in his chair, took a long, deep draw on his pipe, and gazed out at the dazzling horizon.
