- "LOUD, BOOMING VOICE: What do you need to know about Criss Angel, the Mindfreak?"

- Yes, he is the awesomest person in the known universe.
- |
  

- He embodies intensity, democratic values, and true "bad-assery.
- "\" He voted Gore in 2000."
- |
  

- He said, "
- I would have voted Copperfield if he wasn't such a pussy!
- "\" Snap."
- |
  

- "He believes in welfare reform, Jim Morrison, and that he can get hit by any vessel you can think of (the  Red October , the  Hindenburg , Megadeth's tour bus, anything)\x97and totally survive."

- He would have chosen fellow magician Lance Burton as head of FEMA "a long time ago.
- "\" For Burton can make \""
- |
  

- "\"\x97AHEM\x97\""
- |
  

- Yes, that is his real jet-black hair.
- |
  

- "And yes, he is from East Meadow, New York\x97although some have claimed he's from the fiery pits of the Seventh Circle of HELL!"

- Iris Weinshall, wife of that pansy Chuck Schumer, once said, "Criss Angel is a messenger of Satan.
- "\" Yeah, a totally buff messenger of Satan who will be your voice, nay, your dragon's breath in the WHITE HOUSE!"
- |
  

- The master provocateur also inspires awe as he challenges Karl Rove, challenges Dick Cheney, challenges WMD claims, and makes a small poodle float four inches above the streets of Washington, D.C.
- |
  

- THE NATION'S CAPITAL!
- |
  

- If he ever lets you down, America, you can personally burn him ALIVE!
- |
  

- And he will, of course, accept full responsibility and let the fire actually burn him this time.
- |
  

- Not like 2005, when he totally was burned alive on the streets of Las Vegas, and TOTALLY LIVED!
- |
  

- If he ever met Osama bin Laden, he'd challenge him to a trash-can-POOF-I'm-on-a-balcony-over-here stunt.
- |
  

- Will bin Laden step up, or will he hide in his "bitch-ass cave like the bitch that he is!
- "\"?"
- |
  

- Would John McCain talk to bin Laden like that?
- |
  

- Would Hillary "
- I Hate Illusions" Clinton?
- |
  

- "No, there is only one: Vote Mindfreak for president."
- |
  

- This message was indeed paid for by the People for Electing Criss Angel, Mindfreak, in 2008's Presidential Election.
