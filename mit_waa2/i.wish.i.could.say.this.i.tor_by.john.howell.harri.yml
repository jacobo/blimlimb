- Man, I really wish I could say this is the first time this has happened to me.
- |
  

- Hell, I wish I could say it's the third.
- |
  

- But it's not.
- |
  

- Nope.
- |
  

- Four times.
- |
  

- This is the fourth time I've been handcuffed to a radiator.
- |
  

- Second time by your organization, now that I think about it.
- Of course, if you want to split hairs about the whole thing, there have been a handful of times I've been handcuffed to other household appliances and/or fixtures.
- |
  

- Like just a couple of weeks ago I found myself handcuffed to one of those sleek new Sharper Image ionic air purifiers.
- |
  

- That, my friends, was a little bit of all right, if you're talking about being handcuffed to something.
- |
  

- Those things are whisper fucking quiet.
- |
  

- No joke.
- |
  

- And if I had to use the bathroom, it was as simple as unplugging that masterpiece of design and function and just lugging it with me to the can.
- |
  

- It was like barely being handcuffed to anything at all.
- |
  

- I was breathing a lot better, too.
- |
  

- I could tell, my heart rate was way lower than normal during the repeated, vicious brass-knuckle beatings.
- You know, now that we're on the subject, that Trane outdoor central-air unit I got handcuffed to last August wasn't terrible, either.
- |
  

- But let me tell you, as efficient and effective as those systems are, they don't do shit for you unless you're inside the house.
- |
  

- Man, it must been 110 degrees that week!
- Yeah, those times were nothing like this Truman-era-lead-paint-coated-radiator-with-ammonia-filled-bucket-for-a-toilet deal you guys got me on now.
- |
  

- But hey, I'm being rude.
- |
  

- Your professionalism really couldn't be more top-notch.
- |
  

- The beatings in particular.
- |
  

- Aces.
- |
  

- Good work, especially around the kidneys and eyes.
- |
  

- Big Jimmy has really done a lot to improve the morale and general gusto of his organization.
- |
  

- Last time he had me handcuffed to a radiator, in an abandoned middle school, the goons he used would just as soon sit there and read  Maxim  as ball-peen you in the sternum.
- |
  

- Probably got put on desk jobs, those slobs, am I right?
- |
  

- Ha!
- |
  

- Not really "collections" material, right? Ha! ... But you guys, though! Forget about it! I haven't coughed up blood like this since Big Ralphie's guys handcuffed me to that '82 Ford Escort down at Dumpleton's Junkyard.
- Big Ralphie is in a different league altogether, though.
- |
  

- Has you guys beat on creativity, no contest.
- |
  

- Sorry, fellas, had to be said.
- |
  

- One time, the man had me handcuffed to 13 prewar waffle irons that he chained together (personally, I should mention) beforehand just for the occasion.
- |
  

- Not only was I super impressed but I also felt special.
- |
  

- Man, I was like some kind of crazy ghost, banging around up in that church belfry with all those waffle irons and chains, getting beaten within an inch of my life!
- |
  

- That Ralphie, he is a thoughtful, meticulous man.
- |
  

- Big Jimmy could learn a thing or two from him.
- No disrespect, though, no disrespect.
- |
  

- Like I said, Big Jimmy has come a long way, and you two are a testament to that fact.
- |
  

- He's moved leaps and bounds past Moderately Sized Wilson, that's for sure.
- |
  

- That guy!
- |
  

- What an amateur!
- |
  

- Man, I don't even feel like I owe him money.
- |
  

- More like a student loan.
- |
  

- When his guys handcuffed me to a radiator, they actually asked me if the cuffs were too tight!
- |
  

- Ha!
- |
  

- I don't even know why I count that time in the illustrious four.
- |
  

- I mean, I got a worse beating when I called that guy at H&R Block a pencil-neck dipshit!
- "Of course, tax evasion isn't something we have to get into right now, as I can see you dudes are busy filling that tube sock with quarters, which\x97gotta be honest again here\x97seen it before."
- |
  

- Painful, yeah, I'll give you that, but not Big Ralphie painful.
- Hey, guys, before you start in again, you mind passing me the ammonia bucket?
