- There is nothing that can rain upon a well-planned trip quite like evil-seeming omens.
- |
  

- It gets in your head until calamity comes, and if it never comes it may as well have.
- |
  

- Like, what do you think when you look up in the sky and you see a raven and a seagull engage and the seagull falls dead in a shower of feathers?
- |
  

- Well, in that case, it happened to be a random occurrence.
- |
  

- Sometimes these things happen.
- |
  

- Maybe it was a weak seagull.
- |
  

- Anyway, the world does not revolve around you.
- |
  

- But, then again, sometimes the world is trying to tell you things, or maybe it's trying to tell someone else things and you're just a bystander.
- |
  

- It gets confusing.
- |
  

- My travels have made me an expert on these matters; hopefully, I can shed some light.
- Discovering a boot at the bottom
- |
  

- This is a telling sign of things being amiss and bad luck afoot.
- |
  

- If you were thinking about taking a boat somewhere, reconsider.
- |
  

- Wear the boot and walk instead.
- |
  

- Wearing a cape would not be a bad idea, either.
- |
  

- Capes bring luck and purple capes, in particular, are said to frighten away the mischievous sprites that torment Ireland.
- Milk raining from the sky
- "I have been caught in a milk storm twice: once in Scotland and another time in Corinth."
- |
  

- Both times, good luck came my way within days.
- |
  

- In Corinth, I won 20 camels in a game of dice, and in Scotland I found two camels wandering unattended by the side of the road.
- |
  

- No one had ever seen camels in Scotland before and I made a considerable income leading the camels as a sort of circus from town to town, until they died of dehydration.
- |
  

- Be sure to discard whatever you were wearing in the milk storm, though.
- |
  

- Within days, it will smell very bad and attract dense clouds of flies.
- Being thrown off a horse
- |
  

- Once, while I was riding out of the city of Trier, I was thrown off my horse and into a leech pit.
- |
  

- My three traveling companions pointed and laughed uproariously.
- |
  

- It wasn't funny; it hurt a lot and I was quite embarrassed.
- |
  

- What's worse, it was a terrible omen.
- |
  

- My companions would not have laughed had they known it foretold that two of them would freeze to death in the Carpathians.
- An eagle flying off with a small child
- Once, while traveling from Damascus to Aleppo, I observed a giant bird descend from the sky and carry off a small child.
- |
  

- Twas an unfortunate sign.
- |
  

- The next day, I had an admixture of lamb and chickpeas that was so distasteful I overturned the table.
- Finding two hearts in a chicken
- Some people foolishly study the innards of birds as a method of divination.
- |
  

- Once, in Denmark, the chef I hired to get me through my stay in the dreadful town of Esbjerg discovered that in one of the chickens he slaughtered there existed two hearts.
- |
  

- I think the discovery revealed more about the chicken than about myself, as my time in Esbjerg was just as intolerable afterward as it had been prior to the discovery.
- Having your hat fly off when
- |
  

- Crete
- Having your hat fly off anywhere is a bad sign.
- |
  

- I've found it means you'll be punched in the face within several days.
- |
  

- The worst time for it to happen, though, is when approaching the island of Crete.
- |
  

- I have been informed that it means the boat will be dashed to pieces on the rocky cliffs unless you placate the gorgons by saying, "Alexander the Great lives and reigns.
- |
  

- He keeps the world at peace.
- "\" Gorgons like Alexander the Great, apparently."
- A woman giving birth to a stone
- "On the night of my arrival in the town of B\xE9ziers, I learned that a woman had given birth to a large stone."
- |
  

- I was vain enough to believe that it had something to do with my arrival and left immediately, mourning that I would not get to sample the white wines the region was famous for.
- |
  

- However, the city burned to the ground that very night.
- |
  

- I kind of lucked out with that one.
