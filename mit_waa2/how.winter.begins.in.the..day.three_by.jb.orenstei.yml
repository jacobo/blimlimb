- Having bought ourselves at least another moment, the respiratory therapist brought an asthma treatment while the nurse rolled the crash cart into the room.

- If the baby's color had remained gray, I would have had to put a breathing tube in within the minute.

- We all held our breath as the baby regained his and, moment by moment, he came back from the brink.

- The respiratory therapist attached a mixture of albuterol and atrovent, two asthma medicines, to the oxygen flow.

- After a minute or two, the baby had revived enough to give a weak cry.

- In five minutes he was grabbing for mom.

- "In half an hour he had regained enough strength to sit and push away at the strangers: me, the nurse, the respiratory therapist."
- The other doc, the one who was supposed to have left already, called out an hour or so later, when the lab result came up, "He's RSV positive.
- "\"What're you still doing here?"
- "\" I asked."
- She shrugged and half-grimaced.

- "\"Someone's got to see all these babies while you're playing around in there."

  On Sunday, the last of my three night stretch, the wheezers finally arrived. Babies had been coming in all day long with the same "chief complaint": resp dist, or respiratory distress. Every one of them had tested positive for RSV, and the admission board was packed with a sizable list of kids awaiting inpatient beds.
  "I don't know where you're gonna put 'em all," the departing doc said.
