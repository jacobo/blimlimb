  TITLE: "Embarrassing Restaurant Story"
  NARRATOR: My friend Molly
  In this short farce, Molly embarks on what she thinks will be a pleasant
  dinner with friends. However, it quickly devolves into a night of many
  horrors. While at the bar waiting, alone, for her dinner mates, she
  encounters a man with whom she once had an unsuccessful date. She is
  careful to avoid him, he meets his own date, and they sit down to eat.
  Later at the table, Molly's friend (who, coincidentally, is also named
  Molly) relates a pregnancy scare, prompting another friend at the table
  to exclaim, loudly, "So Molly, you think you're pregnant?" Of course,
  this gets the attention of the lost date (and his own date) and another
  man, who turns around and recognizes his old friend Molly, the narrator,
  from high school.
  EVALUATION: The appearance of a second surprise ghost from the past
  provides a nice
  twist to the conventional mortification play, but in general the
  account's lack of dialogue and vivid detail keep it from transcending
  the genre.
