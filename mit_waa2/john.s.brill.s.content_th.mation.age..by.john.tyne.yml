  Each installment of John's Brill's Content serves to take a hard, 
  critical look at the magazine Brill's Content, a magazine that serves
  to  take a pulsating, critiquish look at the media. "Who Watches the 
  Watchmen?" they say, and Brill's Content does. But "Who Watches Those
  Who  Watch the Watchmen?" we say, and we do. That.

  ITEM: HEAD SIZE WATCH
  Brill's Content is a large magazine. That is, the actual measurements of
  the magazine are larger than many other magazines: 9"x10 7/8". There are
  larger, but so be it. That's a half-inch wider than a normal piece of
  paper. This additional size gives Brill's Content a rare opportunity
  among magazinepublishingdom: the opportunity to print a photograph of
  someone's head  1  on the cover at nearly or exactly the actual size of
  their head. In other words, you could hold the magazine up to the real
  person's head and nod sagely that yes, they were the same size, or
  almost so.
  The pinnacle of this zenith-like peak of full-frontal publishing
  technology was achieved by Brill's Content in the March 1999 issue. The
  cover features the head of the son of a man, John F. Kennedy, Jr. (That
  is, John F. Kennedy, Jr., is the son of the man, not the man whose son's
  head is on the cover.) The head is printed quite large---perhaps,
  indeed, life size.
  As if reeling from the porous blow of this man's face printed so largely
  that you could cut out the eyes and affix it to your skin in lieu of
  costly plastic surgery, Brill's Content opted the following month to
  both recognize its achievement in the head-size arts and make a
  stinging, steaming cup of Content Comment about the pervasiveness of
  sexual discrimination in the media. The April 1999 issue featured the
  large headline HEAD TO HEAD---ah ha!---and then printed colorless, black
  & white cover heads of Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric, both considerably
  reduced from actual size and brutally cropped. The puny size of these
  professional female broadcasters' heads and their lack of color when
  compared to the bulging, life-size floridity of John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s
  head on the previous issue makes an eloquent if unelaborated point:
  women in the media have small, colorless heads, while men have large,
  blushing  2  ones.
  John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s near-life-size cover head also compares favorably
  to past cover heads. The previous issue, February 1999, had no cover
  head. December 1998/January 1999 had a full-body glamour shot of Mickey
  Mouse, but since he is a fictional character it's difficult to gauge his
  head size; certainly it's far, far smaller than the frankly huge Mickey
  Mouse heads worn by costumed theme-park employees. November 1998 had
  Matt Drudge, in what was obviously a smaller-than-life-size appearance;
  presumably they needed room to include his frankly huge hat. October
  1998 presents a massive slap against the collective or sequential faces
  of Hugh Downs, Barbara Walters, Stone Phillips, and Jane Pauley, none of
  whose heads are shown even as large as the "G" in "WARNING," which
  appears just below their heads. And finally, the debut issue from
  September 1998 delivers perhaps the most unkindest cut of all: Ken Starr
  gets the coveted cover head slot but his tiny little head is almost lost
  in a sea of many heads, none of whom really belong to anyone who would
  ever be a cover head if they hadn't happened to be next to Ken Starr
  when that picture was taken. Perhaps it was a  3  family reunion.
