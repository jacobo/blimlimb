  He'll probably drop out soon. As the primaries approach, the Washington senator
  looks more and more like a Washington General&#151;someone whose job it is to lose
  stupidly. But Orrin Hatch and other Republican presidential aspirants can still
  find solace and potential strategy in the experiences of&#151;I'm sorry about this&#151;Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf.
  Hank collected 43,000 votes in People magazine's 1998 "Most Beautiful People"
  poll, giving him a 38,000-vote margin of victory over his nearest competition
  (Leonardo DiCaprio, who is not a dwarf). Solace: People want to see the
  establishment candidate lose. Solace: People like the idea of turning a fatuous
  beauty contest on its exquisite ear. And strategy: Anyone can be elected to
  anything if his name is a line of trochaic tetrameter catalectic.
  Seven syllables. Four trochaic feet, with the line's terminal breve omitted. For
  whatever reasons, this metrical template is stamped on the human subconscious.
  Anything that fits it can be memorized almost instantly. In ancient Greek and
  Latin, it was the basic meter for recitation forms. And it remains familiar in
  part because it is the signature cadence of so many English nursery rhymes:

  Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf. Like the famous "aesthetic number" 1.618, trochaic
  tetrameter catalectic has an ineffable attraction. And it's especially potent in
  the realm of politics, as recent American history attests. What are the names of
  this century's two best-loved presidents? John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Uh huh. And
  Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which contains a verse-medial dactyl but still scans
  comfortably, like "like a diamond in the sky."
  It's a pretty particular form&#151;not inflexible, but not accommodating of much
  variation either. Generally, the less snug the fit, the less secure the
  political reputation. George Herbert Walker Bush falls one critical unstressed
  syllable short. William Jefferson Clinton is syllabically correct but does not
  meet the metrical requirement, unless, of course, you pronounce it with a Cajun
  accent. (Clinton did carry Louisiana in both of his elections.) What's certain
  is that strict adherence to the form assures a public figure not only name
  recognition but a modicum of popular acceptance, no matter how well-publicized
  his personal failings. (Yeah, you hear me, Charles Phillip Arthur George).
  In light of this, it's clear what candidates such as Orrin Hatch should be doing
  right now&#151;having their names legally changed to things like "Marvelous Maurice
  Monroe." Here are some possibilities they might want to consider:
  John McCain:
  Johnny Rhythm J McCain
  Rufus R. the Superstar
  Tony "It's My Life" Montaigne
  Gary Bauer:
  Gary Had a Little Lamb
  Buster Jackson Johnson Jones
  Pearly Whites 'n Baby Blues
  Steve Forbes:
  Arthur Fonzarelli Forbes
  Rubber Baby Buggy Steve
  Ernest Capital J. Gaines
  Alan Keyes:
  Betty You Can Call Me Al
  Al the Angry Drunken Keyes
  Al Keyes a.k.a. A.K.
  Pat Buchanan:
