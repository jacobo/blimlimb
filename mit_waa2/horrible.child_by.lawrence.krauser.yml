  ACT I
  (P and Q)
  P
  Horrible
  Q
  Horrible, what it is
  P
  Unbelievable
  Q
  Incredible, it's like a bad dream
  P
  A nightmare, like having a miniature Caligula
  in the middle of our home
  Q
  In the middle of the living room
  P
  Horrible
  Q
  Horrible. When it was born we hired a professional
  courtroom artist to do sketches in the delivery room
  P
  This is how it thanks us
  Q
  The artist died of shock&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;why not we?
  P
  No such luck
  Q
  Horrible. I can't even bear to look at them anymore,
  those sketches
  P
  Professional drawings! My spouse can't even
  Q
  I can't, I won't
  P
  look at them anymore because of the horrible
  Q
  When I think of the agony I endured giving birth to that
  P
  that
  Q
  that
  P
  that
  Q
  that
  P,Q
  That Monster! That Horrible Monster!
  (PAUSE)
  P
  Do you remember the rose petals we scattered
  on our stomach when we found out we were pregnant?
  Q
  Do you remember how we danced the night after
  the afternoon we learned we were with child?
  P
  I remember the gold filling in the doctor's rear-left mouth
  the moment he said the word:
  P,Q
  PREGNANT
  P
  How it glistened during the first syllable
  Q
  PREG...
  P
  and expanded and burst like a star
  Q
  the entire cavity of his mouth, bright
  P
  blinding&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;How he yelped, his mouth scorched,
  light flying from his mouth, filling
  the entire office with the second syllable
  Q
  &#151;NANT!
  P
  crashing through the window, shattering glass
  Q
  cascading out into the still, crisp air
  P,Q
  that late Thursday afternoon in winter
  Q
  on this unmoored continent adrift in the seas
  P
  of this spherical clump of matter in space
  Q
  how the word thawed the ice
  on the windshield of our automobile
  as we sat there in the parking lot that Thursday
  P
  how we sat there holding hands
  P,Q
  pregnant
  Q
  as the word did its work
  loosening the molecules of ice as we sat,
  P
  As we sat
  P,Q
  as we sat there pregnant, and full of hope&nbsp;&#151;
  P
  Deceitful memory.
  Q
  False harbinger.
  P
  Vestigial joy.
