- Introduction]
- "Doug: It's funny, because I work in the music business and Tina is&nbsp;&#151;"
- "Tina: I'm an editor at a fashion magazine and we have this joke."
- "D: We say that we've got the sexiest jobs out of all our friends, but we're too stressed out to have sex."
- "T: This should be interesting."
- |
  

- It would be nice to have something to help us get in the mood.
- |
  

- After fifteen minutes alone.
- |
  

- "Doug: Can you feel anything?"
- "Tina: I just felt you touch my arm when you said that."
- "D: I mean, do you feel this stuff working at all?"
- "T: Not really."
- "D: My neck feels weird."
- |
  

- Like I have a little bit of a sore throat.
- |
  

- After thirty minutes alone.
- |
  

- "Tina: They're making us get every client lunch approved before we expense it now."
- "Doug: Really?"
- |
  

- The label told us we can spend exactly one third of what we used to get for pre release CD promotion on any client.
- |
  

- Even if they've got a video in high rotation; one-third across the board.
- "T: Jesus."
- |
  

- Really?
- "D: Isn't that stupid?"
- |
  

- A year ago they were practically begging us to spend as much as we could on promotion.
- "T: It'll all blow over at some point."
- |
  

- Everybody just has to sweat it out.
- |
  

- After one hour alone.
- |
  

- "Tina: Does your neck still hurt, honey?"
- "Doug: Kind of, yeah."
- |
  

- I might just go to sleep.
- "T: Blind Date is on."
- "D: Oh, okay."
- |
  

- Cool.
- |
  

- I was thinking we missed it.
- |
  

- Couple retires to television and then to sleep.

- Introduction]
- "Steve: We have definitely slowed down a little after having children."
- "Connie: I like the idea of trying something like this."
- "S: We were only going to have one."
- "C: So, do we just drink it and kind of wait for something to happen?"
- "S: But then everyone tells you these 'only child' horror stories."
- |
  

- After fifteen minutes alone.
- |
  

- "Connie: I feel like I have more energy."
- "Steve: [nods]"
- "C: Maybe like I have more stamina."
- "S: Big commitment, kids."
- |
  

- After thirty minutes alone.
- |
  

- "Steve: I mean, I still can't believe we're the adults in the house, you know?"
- "Connie: Oh, this is nice."
- |
  

- I feel very stimulated.
- "S: [looks at watch]"
- "C: I wonder what would happen if we drank two each."
- |
  

- After an hour alone.
- |
  

- "Steve: I don't think that ever changes."
- |
  

- I think some people will always look in the mirror and see themselves as the child and not the parent, you know?
- "Connie: Honey did you finish yours?"
- "S: What?"
- |
  

- The soda thing?
- |
  

- Yeah.
- "C: How do you feel?"
- "S: It tastes weird."

- Introduction]
- "Sam: In my day, you didn't buy anything from Japan."
- "Bea: Back then we only bought American."
- "S: You buy from the Japanese and they used the money to buy ammunitions to shoot my ass."
- "B: Oh, he's not going to be in the mood for romance if you get him thinking about that war."
- |
  

- After fifteen minutes alone.
- |
  

- "Sam: What the hell do they want us to do, again?"
- "Bea: I think we just see if this vitamin pack makes us feel\x85"
- "S: The vitamins we just took?"
- "B: Yes, the vitamins we just took."
- |
  

- That's why were supposed to be alone now.
- |
  

- After thirty minutes alone.
- |
  

- "Sam: Most vitamins will take a week or two to make much of a difference."
- "Bea: Oh, I wonder if they're going to leave us alone in here for two weeks."
- "S: Dear God, the Japanese finally got me right where they want me."
- |
  

- Both start laughing.
- |
  

- "B: Well, I feel thirsty."
- |
  

- Do you think they would be interested in knowing that their vitamins make me thirsty?
- |
  

- After an hour alone.
- |
  

- "Bea: All these things have put me in the mood for is a glass of water."
- "Sam: Maybe that's what they're looking to do."
- "B: Well, it's working."
- "S: See this way, I get up like a gentleman and get you a glass of water and you fall in love with me all over again, sweet Bea."
- "B: Oh, Sam you couldn't be a better catch."
- |
  

- Couple embraces, laughing, and spends a very passionate romantic evening together.
