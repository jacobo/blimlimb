- Be sure to read  Part One  of this interview.

- "Q: Before speaking with you, I read over many of your books and came across one of the most heartbreaking paragraphs I've ever read in  Timequake : \"I was the baby of the family."
- |
  

- Now I don't have anybody to show off for anymore.
- "Kurt Vonnegut: [Long pause] Yeah."
- |
  

- Pause] Where do you fit into in your family?
- "Q: I'm the oldest."
- |
  

- I have one younger brother.
- "Vonnegut: You're certainly very different people."
- |
  

- Chances are he's a helluva lot funnier than you are.
- |
  

- The only way he could get attention at the dinner table is by being funny.
- "Q: You have outlived your ancestors, and many of your colleagues in letters."
- "Vonnegut: Yes, well, that's the reason that I don't want to be in New York any longer."
- |
  

- I don't want to go to parties any more.
- |
  

- There are no familiar faces anymore.
- |
  

- You know, you go to a party and you hone in on the couple people you know.
- |
  

- There are none of those people for me at parties any more.
- |
  

- I've lost my sister, my brother, my editor, my publisher.
- |
  

- It's a whole generation gone by.
- |
  

- Old war buddies of mine, my colleagues, my family.
- "Q: Joseph Heller, in 1999."
- "Vonnegut: I took that one very hard."
- "Q: You were one of the few people to walk out of Dresden."
- |
  

- Now, some fifty years later, you're among the last men standing.
- "Vonnegut: Every so often I run into someone on the street who announces to me that they are really a survivor."
- |
  

- I mean, who the fuck isn't?
- |
  

- If you're not dead, you're a survivor.
- |
  

- Laughs]
- "Q: You seem quite sure that there is no afterlife."
- |
  

- But do you think it's even worth the wishing?
- "Vonnegut: Well, yeah."
- |
  

- I've met a lot of interesting people in this life, and I've lost most of them &#151; friends and relatives.
- |
  

- I'd like to see some of these people again.
- |
  

- I'd love to see my old war buddies.
- |
  

- I'd like to see my college roommate.
- |
  

- And my brother and my sister.
- |
  

- On the other hand, they probably all died because they were sick of my old, familiar stories.
- |
  

- Laughs]
- "Q: When I was reading  Dr. Kevorkian , I was reminded a bit of a Japanese film from a couple years ago called \"Afterlife."
- "Vonnegut: I haven't heard of it."
- "Q: Its premise is that those who have recently died are taken to a waiting room for one week, during which time they must choose only a single memory from their entire lives which will endlessly replay for them, while all of their other memories are erased."
- "Vonnegut: So everybody's fucking, right?"
- "Q: See, that's the peculiar thing."
- |
  

- Maybe in your world or mine, everybody's fucking.
- |
  

- But in this movie, some of the memories are much simpler, almost elegant.
- |
  

- Many people can't choose a memory at all.
- "Vonnegut: See, that's a whole different culture."
- |
  

- I don't know anything about it.
- "Q: Any idea what memory you might choose?"
- "Vonnegut: [Long pause] I think it would be the moment where I was doing everything right, where I was beyond criticism."
- |
  

- It was back in World War II.
- |
  

- It was snowing, but everything was black.
- |
  

- The trucks were rolling in.
- |
  

- I was surrounded by my buddies.
- |
  

- And my rifle was between my knees, my helmet on my head.
- |
  

- I was ready for anything.
- |
  

- And I was right where I belonged.
- |
  

- That would be the moment.
- |
  

- It would  have  to be the moment.
- "Q: There are not many moments in a man's life like that, I would imagine."
- "Vonnegut: No. But you know who gets those kinds of moments all the time?"
- |
  

- A musician.
- |
  

- They're doing exactly what they're supposed to do.
- |
  

- I look at a symphony orchestra and everybody's doing exactly right.
- |
  

- How the fuck do they do that?
- |
  

- It's like watching somebody's who's just inherited a big bunch of money.
- |
  

- "\"Well, enjoy yourself."
- |
  

- I'm just gonna fuck off &#151; you know what I'm saying.
- "Q: You made it to the Timequake [scheduled, per Vonnegut's book, for February 13, 2001]."
- |
  

- In that book, you also guessed that you'd be at the novel's climactic clambake in 2010.
- |
  

- Do you still think you'll be there?
- "Vonnegut: Oh, I hope not."
- |
  

- I killed Kilgore Trout.
- |
  

- I'd kill myself if I only could.
- "Q: Do you think our atomic toys might even cut the party short?"
- "Vonnegut: Yeah."
- |
  

- We're only animals, but special animals at that.
- |
  

- Every animal has fought and killed to survive, even before the dinosaurs.
- |
  

- We're the only ones that do it for fun.
- |
  

- That's why I don't know about Darwinism.
- |
  

- Supposedly evolution and natural selection are all about survival, but we haven't gotten smarter over the years, only more dangerous.
- |
  

- I think the big winners are the ones who get off of the planet first.
- |
  

- Laughs] And so I have trouble with Darwin.
- |
  

- I mean, if they can kill Christ, they can kill anybody!
- "Q: Underneath the humor and the humanism of  Timequake  is the chilling prospect of having to relive the last ten years of history."
- |
  

- Who wants to deal with Rodney King, O.J.
- |
  

- Simpson, Tania Harding, and the Clinton Impeachment all over again?
- "Vonnegut: Do you know what I think?"
- |
  

- I think O.J.
- |
  

- They claimed the evidence was only circumstantial, but that's because he didn't bring the heads home.
- |
  

- Long, hacking laughter]
- "Q: Well that is, in fact, the thing: Rodney King didn't deserve a beating, but he was under the influence and speeding."
- |
  

- O.J.
- |
  

- Bill Clinton, beyond a shadow of a shadow, got a hummer in the oval office.
- "Vonnegut: The oral office."
- |
  

- Laughs]
- "Q: Everything is merely circumstantially evidential these days."
- |
  

- No one's guilt or innocence can be proven irrevocably.
- "Vonnegut: Yeah, that's all anyone can take."
- |
  

- No one wants hard facts.

  Vonnegut: The oral office. [Laughs]
  Q: Everything is merely circumstantially evidential these days. No one's guilt or innocence can be proven irrevocably.
