- Here we are, sweaty palmed, proficient in our mathematics and sciences, trying terribly not to stand out.

- We're along a wall, a white wall that's seven feet six inches high.

- We admire views.

- We have become perfectly adept at remarking upon the small pleasures in the places we visit.
- "\"A lovely symmetry to this room."
- "\"A perfect harmony of blues and greens in the streamers."
- "\"The party is lush with talent."
- The three of us, myself in the middle, have synchronized our watches in time with the big wall clock on the other side of the party.

- There was no reason to do this.
- Here we are, firmly planted along the wall, complimenting each other's clothes.
- "\"Hell of a blazer you got there, Franklin."
- "\"You think so?"

- I just wore it at the Spring Fling.
- "\"Nice thing about a blazer like that is, you notice it, you like it, but it's not so damned flashy that you can't wear it often without people noticing all that much."
- I'm in the middle of this, my head turning back and forth to each person as they address the other.
- Franklin says, "What'd you polish those shoes with, Nathan?
- "\"It's Meltonian Boot & Shoe Cream."

- Not only does it polish the shoe, it actually conditions the leather.
- And it comes in an array of colors.
- |
  

- His is number 78, Cordovan.
- |
  

- We are running out of things to say.
- I remark on the shine of the hardwood floors.
- |
  

- A drawn out murmur of agreement ensues.
- Across the room, some 357 miles away, is Patti Whittaker, resident tease.
- |
  

- She is having oodles of fun, hanging on the arm of some local heartthrob a year or two older, someone doubtless named Sky Masters.
- |
  

- We watch with rapt attention, our mouths moving in aped speech, engaging us in the conversation too far away to be heard.
- |
  

- Patti is telling me she loves me, and I am saying I love her too, and I do.
- |
  

- She laughs, covering her bared teeth with her hand.
- |
  

- I am charming and witty.
- |
  

- Sky Masters is slow and supercilious.
- |
  

- "Her decision is easy: I am the beau for her."
- |
  

- I am masterfully confident and adroit.
- |
  

- Sky Masters is unable to say, "Boo" to a goose.
- Our paths cross in endless corridors, our eyes do not meet, and we shuffle along to two other parts of the world.
