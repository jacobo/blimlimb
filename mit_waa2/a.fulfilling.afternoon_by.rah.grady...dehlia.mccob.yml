- Several weeks ago, a small gathering of volunteers spent an afternoon stickering copies of the new book by Sheila Heti.
- |
  

- Two of those volunteers wrote short dispatches about their trip to the warehouse, which were then edited together.
- |
  

- We are currently looking for more  volunteers  who will be available next Thursday, November 21.
- |
  

- I drove right past Fulfillment America at first, because I was distracted by a conversation about James Bond on the radio.
- |
  

- It's a pretty unassuming place .
- |
  

- I was 15 minutes early anyway.
- When I walked in the door, I told the receptionist that I was there for "the McSweeney's stickering", and she made a quick phone call and asked me to sign in. I did so and looked around the lobby. It was filled with elephants. There was a huge painting of a family of elephants on the wall, and a table covered with elephant statues of all sorts. I later found out that they were a favorite of the CEO of Fulfillment America and good luck as long as their trunks were up and pointing at the door.
- A woman named Mary greeted me and told me to follow her.
- |
  

- She led me into the warehouse while I joked with her about the company name.
- |
  

- I had always thought it was amusing getting packages from them, and it was even more amusing once I saw that most of the items they were using to fulfill people, so to speak, were large posters of hamburgers to be hung on wall at Arby's and phone books.
- |
  

- I asked her, "What do you do with all the huge posters of donuts and stuff once the promotions are over?
- "\"We destroy them,\""
- |
  

- Destroy seemed like such a strong word.
- Fulfillment America is a vast and wondrous place.
- |
  

- Mary, who was very kind and helpful, showed us to a corner of the warehouse where pallets contained stacks of boxes bearing the Oddi logo, each box containing 108 copies of  The Middle Stories .
- |
  

- There were a lot of books.
- |
  

- And we were very few people.
- |
  

- It was a somewhat daunting task, but we were up for the challenge.
- |
  

- "Neither Dehlia nor I really had any idea what was supposed to be going on\x8Bhow many people to expect or explicit instructions on our task."
- |
  

- Dehlia had gotten an e-mail right before she left but it didn't reveal much more than what we already knew, so Mary called McSweeney's to ask them for specifics.
- |
  

- She chatted with Eli and then passed the phone to me.
- |
  

- I was apparently the team leader.
- Dehlia and I went to the room where we'd be stickering, and set up a sort of efficiency plan.
- |
  

- There were five stickers, and each had been custom-defaced by someone somewhere.
- |
  

- We had 2 theories as to whose art this was.
- |
  

- The people at McSweeney's made the students at 826 Valencia do it.
- |
  

- Canadians.
- |
  

- The second theory was reinforced by the prevalence of Canadian flags, and not a single American flag, although since the author is Canadian perhaps that was being taken into account.
- The process became hypnotic, as we affixed (and affixed) many fascinating stickers.
- |
  

- Some of them caused us to pause in wonder.
- |
  

- There were wild-eyed men with ink-drawn pig noses, and a contemplative adolescent at a dance, lost in that quagmire of slow-dance-inspired confusion that we all remember maybe too well, thinking thought-bubble images of many intriguing things.
- |
  

- Two young men whirled euphorically on a beach beneath a variety of objects poised to fall on them from the sky, while other things lurked in the water behind them.
- |
  

- I knew that I would dream of these things that night.
- Dehlia and I were joined by Toby while we were still in the middle of our first box of books.
- |
  

- Apparently it was an extended lunch break for him.
- |
  

- He opened up a box and started in on the process.
- |
  

- While we worked, the music kept changing.
- |
  

- At first there was just some Cuban music.
- |
  

- Then, someone turned on hip-hop over the Cuban music.
- |
  

- The Cuban music changed to soft rock .
- |
  

- Bryan Adams, Roxette, Rod Stewart, Tiffany.
- |
  

- Sometimes different kinds of music at once, a collage of sound, echoing from different corners of the warehouse.
- |
  

- "High point: Aretha Franklin."
- As the afternoon progressed, we acquired speed, artistic precision, and skill.
- |
  

- We learned things.
- |
  

- Sara described her PhD research on horseshoe crabs.
- |
  

- Toby told how he worked for Puma and was going to be sent to Germany for a couple of years.
- |
  

- He also told us the legend of the feuding German brothers and the establishment of their respective sportswear companies.
- |
  

- Rudolph and Adi Dasler both wanted sportswear companies but didn't get along, so Rudolph founded Puma, and Adi founded Adidas.
- |
  

- Adi-Das(ler).
- |
  

- The legend portion of the story is that they built factories on opposite sides of a river, and Toby said he expected to find warring factions walking down the sidewalks of town dressed in Adidas and Puma tracksuits.
- |
  

- Dehlia said she was looking for a job, preferably in a bookstore.
- |
  

- She had interviewed at a few places but hadn't heard anything yet.
- |
  

- A few hours later, her cell phone rang and she got a job at the Brookline Booksmith right then and there.
- Toby had to leave early, but Sara and I stayed on until nearly 5:30.
- |
  

- We both got to the point where we were dazed, and just working as automatons.
- |
  

- Whereas at noon there was laughter and "Hey, look at this one!
- |
  

- It's awesome!
- "\" and holding up different stickers, at 5:00 they were sort of muttering and saying things like \""
- Look.
- |
  

- This person did, like, six of the same thing.
- |
  

- Way to be boring.
- "\" Then again, the people who drew with the Sharpies must have gotten pretty worn out too."
- |
  

- At 5:30 or so, Mary came in and said that the stickering adventure must come to an end, as all good things inevitably do.
- |
  

- We looked around in amazement at the many open, re-packed boxes containing stickered copies of  The Middle Stories , and could only hope that we had done justice in our small way to Sheila Heti's work, placing the stickers just so, in a way that would communicate to intrigued readers, Here is the gateway to the realm of  The Middle Stories  . .
- |
  

- Enter here, if you dare.
- Both of us expressed a desire to come back and finish the job at some point in the future though.
- |
  

- For tedious work, it was quite a lot of fun and as most random experiences tend to be, filled with peculiarities.
- I've already finished the book.
- |
  

- My cover was the only one written in blue Sharpie, is on the picture of the two guys on the beach, and has the tail end of a fish in the water and the words "Come back .
