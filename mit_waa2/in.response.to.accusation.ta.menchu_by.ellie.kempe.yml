  I write today to defend myself against a literary offense of the highest degree: plagiarism.\n\
  In 1983, a 24-year-old Guatemalan Indian and human-rights activist named Rigoberta Menchu took part in a series of interviews with a Venezuelan-French woman whose name I cannot remember. The taped interviews were transcribed and  I, Rigoberta Menchu  was published. Menchu would later go on to receive the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of indigenous peoples. Her memoir is, quite simply, the tale of a luckless woman living under an abusive military dictatorship.\n\

  From then on, I was very depressed about life. I was afraid of life and I'd ask myself: \"What will it be like when I'm older?\"\n\
  This is a passage from my memoir. Several energetic critics have also found it in  I, Rigoberta Menchu . Evidently, similar life experiences will inspire similar wordings.\n\
  \"From then on\" refers to the period directly following my AP U.S. history exam, on which I received a 2. I was very upset about this, because I had previously thought that I was pretty good at U.S. history and had planned to major in history or politics in college. It now seemed that the only avenues left open to me were English or sports therapy. My once sunny outlook on life took a decidedly devastating turn.\n\
  I can't remember exactly what Rigoberta Menchu is referring to in the passage, but I believe that it has something to do with seeing her brother burn to death at the  fincas .\n\
