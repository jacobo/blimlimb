- |
  

- Take in a boarder'' I advised.
- |
  

- "Three months later, he wrote and told me my advice worked: His wife was having a baby."
- |
  

- I asked, 'What about the boarder?
- |
  

- He said, 'She's having a baby too!

- "Henny Youngman's  Bar Jokes, Bar Bets, Bar Tricks  (Gramercy Publishing, 1978), pages 66-67:"
- "\"A 70-year-old man married a girl of 20, and immediately was given advice by his friends."
- |
  

- One of them said, 'If you want a happy marriage, you must take in a boarder.
- |
  

- This appealed to the old man, and a few months later he met his friend who wanted to know how things were coming along.
- The old man said, 'Things couldn't be better, and I owe it all to your good advice.
- |
  

- His friend said, 'I'm glad to hear it, and how's your wife?
- |
  

- The old guy said, 'Oh, she's pregnant.

- "\"The young bride had waited patiently 'til her wedding night, and as they finally got into bed, the nearby church bells began to ring."

- Let's make love every time the bells ring'' she suggested.
- |
  

- In the morning, the husband, tired and weary, walked to the church and told the bell-ringer, 'Listen, I'll give you $100 if you ring the bell once every two hours.

- Sheila suggested coyly that they make love every time the old night watchman rang his hourly bell.
- |
  

- George smiled in delight at this prospect, but four rings later he pretended he had to go out for cigarettes and staggered off to the watchman's tower.
- |
  

- Listen, old man,' he wheezed, 'do me a favor and for the rest of the night ring the bell at two hour intervals instead of hourly.
- |
  

- Here.
- |
  

- I'll give you some money.
- |

- Please!
- "\" But this message, Mr. Adams, is directed to the lay-person, or even for the public speaker."
- |
  

- Not to you, Mr. Adams.

- Not for thee, Joey, do these jokes about bells toll.
- |
  

- Yes, jokes are often repeated, or forwarded via chain e-mail, without crediting the original source.
- |
  

- Often, the original source cannot even be traced.
- |
  

- But these jokes are not in the public domain.
- |
  

- This is not "Why did the chicken cross the road?
- "\" (Or is that one of yours, too, Joey?"
- |
  

- Yes, jokes often "work" better when told in the first person. But why, then, do you go to great lengths to print the names of other comedians you quote -- like Bob Hope and Milton Berle -- in bold-face type? Is it because they're technically alive? One day, you even quoted Roseanne, Joan Rivers, and Phyllis Diller -- all of whom have undergone plastic surgery. But we know what that's about. You want to get in their pants.
- |
  

- Yes, you were a friend of Henny Youngman.
- |
  

- As Judas was a friend of Jesus, as Brutus was a friend of Caesar.
- |
  

- Unless Henny bequeathed those jokes to you in his will, you should properly credit him (as Puff Daddy credited Sting, and MC Hammer credited Rick James before him).
- |
  

- You could learn a lot from these music-masters, Joey.
- |
  

- From Puff and Sting you could learn the meaning of a little word we call "friendship.
- |
  

- This must stop.
- |
  

- This lying, this deception, this thievery and skullduggery.
- |
  

- How can our daily guffaws come at such a price?
- |
  

- Joey, you purport to bring to a reader's day a refreshing dose of humor and levity, and so we drink from your trough.
- |
  

- But it is not refreshing, the contents of your trough.
- |
  

- Not at all.
- |
  

- It is ashes in our mouths.
- |
  

- Nay, worse.
- |
  

- You know what it tastes like?
- |
  

- It tastes like hot, poisoned blood.
- Joey, this must end.
- But when you bring it to an end, don't do it for us.
- |
  

- Do it for the children.
- For they are the future.
