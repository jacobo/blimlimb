- Issue 10 is guest-edited by Michael Chabon, and it is dedicated to genre fiction of all types &#8212; adventure, thriller, science fiction, and so on.
- |
  

- Chabon had the idea, made this all happen, and has pulled together 20 spine-tingling, bone-chilling, heart-racing stories.
- |
  

- "Here are the last names of this issue's contributors: Alexie, Bender, Chabon, Chaon, Crichton, Eggers, Ellison, Emshwiller, Fowler, Gaiman, Gold, Hornby, Leonard, Link, King, King, Moody, Moorcock, Offutt, Shepard."
- |
  

- "Here are the first names: Sherman, Aimee, Michael, Dan, Michael, Dave, Harlan, Carol, Karen, Neil, Glen, Nick, Elmore, Kelly, Stephen, Laurie, Rick, Michael, Chris, Jim."
- |
  

- This book will benefit the 826 Valencia Writing Project, the tutoring center we've opened in San Francisco.
- Some people have asked us, "What are these big names doing in our beloved McSweeney's?
- |
  

- Have you forgotten your love for the common man, the free-thinking reader, the unpublished writer?
- "\" The answer is this: \""
- No." We have not forgotten that.
- |
  

- Michael Chabon, in assembling the issue, sought to bring non-genre writers into that world, and to bring popular genre writers to readers like yourself.
- |
  

- These are great writers and great stories, and it all came together like wildfire.
- |
  

- Or do we mean like a house on fire?
- |
  

- It came together quickly and unexpectedly, and we are very pleased with the results and very grateful to Mr. Chabon and all the contributors.
- As the list of contributors grew, we realized that we had a good book on our hands, the kind of book sold at airports or even, if we dared dream, supermarkets.
- |
  

- In keeping with the spirit of the pulp novels, it made sense to make the issue available to as many people as possible.
- |
  

- But we didn't have much experience with large numbers, so we weren't sure how to proceed.
- At the same time we were thinking about this, we were gearing up for our first fall schoolyear at 826 Valencia, and we were short of funds.
- |
  

- Like most nonprofits in 2002, we had a dry spell in donations and revenue from our pirate-supply store (this is true).
- |
  

- Vintage, a great paperback book-publishing company, offered to buy the rights to distribute Issue 10 as a paperback book, and we agreed.
- |
  

- They paid this fee directly to 826 Valencia, and these funds kept the learning lab afloat throughout the fall.
- There are two slightly different versions of this issue.
- |
  

- The first version, which was printed by our favorite Oddi Printing Corp of Reykjavik, is available only to subscribers, and is currently on its way to their homes.
- |
  

- The second version is Vintage's, and is full of the same fantastic stories; it will appear in bookstores (and maybe airports) in late March.
- Both versions look different from previous issues of McSweeney's.
- |
  

- In an effort to conform to the look of '40s-era pulp magazines and genre collections, we've used a two-column format, and some new fonts, and title-page illustrations by the excellent Howard Chaykin.
- |
  

- The book is a 500-page paperback; it will not fit in your pocket.
- "In any case, the important thing to know is this: The unusual aspects of this issue do not indicate a general change, either editorial or financial, in our focus or mission, to the extent that we have either."
- |
  

- "We are working on Issue 11 at this very moment, and we assure you it will include all of those things you have grown to love: new contributors, a consistent font, a story set at a crafts fair, and a very special, financially-unwise extra feature."
- |
  

- It will be great.
- |
  

- Also keep an eye out for the upcoming Marcel Dzama book, which is not really a book at all; that too will be great.
- |
  

- And  To Ruhleben &#8212; And Back , the newest classic from the Collins Library &#8212; great as well.
- |
  

- It's a reissue of a young man's account of escaping from a German POW camp during WWI, and has been out of print for over fifty years.
