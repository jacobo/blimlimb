- March 5
- Maureen brought the new guy around who's going to be working in our group.
- |
  

- After the Jason fiasco, we really could use someone with a little bit of a brain who can keep up on things.
- |
  

- This guy's named Winnie and, I don't know, I just have a bad feeling.
- March 9
- I've been training Winnie for three days now and I'm ready to kill him.
- |
  

- I showed him how the spreadsheets are updated on the network, and he just stared at me with this blank expression.
- |
  

- I tried to demonstrate the copy machine, but he somehow got his head stuck in one of the slots.
- |
  

- I heard his muffled cry of "Oh, bother!
- "\" as five of us worked on getting him out."
- |
  

- Honestly, is this the best that recruiting could do?
- |
  

- Kirk thinks Winnie might be someone's cousin or something.
- |
  

- Not a bad explanation, except that we don't have any other yellow bears working here.
- March 11
- Although he's worthless, everyone loves Winnie.
- |
  

- The girls from marketing come by at least a couple of times a day to hang around his cubicle and talk to him.
- |
  

- It's not like they respect his work, since he doesn't do any.
- |
  

- And I don't think they even respect him.
- |
  

- They're just there to be, like, amused.
- |
  

- If he were to make a move on one of them, they'd shoot him down so fast.
- |
  

- I mean, I don't respect Winnie, either, but at least I keep my distance.
- March 15
- I gave Winnie this file of research material on Crawford & Horowitz, because I thought he might want to read up on it before the group meeting tomorrow.
- |
  

- I'm doing him a favor, right?
- |
  

- So I go to get it back from him after lunch and find Winnie sitting on the floor, his hand in a honey jar, and all this paperwork, including the file I need, smeared with thick honey.
- |
  

- It's unusable now.
- |
  

- I might as well throw it away.
- |
  

- Trying not to just go off on the bear, I asked him what the hell happened.
- |
  

- He looked all confused and mumbled something about needing "a little post-lunch snack.
- "\" Jesus."
- |
  

- Have a freakin' apple, dude.
- March 16
- Turns out Winnie got honey all over his keyboard as well.
- |
  

- So what happens?
- |
  

- They bring him a whole new computer.
- |
  

- Top of the line machine, too.
- |
  

- Here I've been pounding away on this ancient piece of crap for years, and Mr. Honeypot gets a whole new setup.
- |
  

- The tech guy who came by said it looked like Winnie had never even turned the old machine on.
- March 19
- "Winnie's friends came by to take him out for lunch today: a little pig, a pissed-off-looking rabbit, an adolescent kangaroo, and a tiger that had to be on coke."
- |
  

- Kirk said he saw them at Sbarro eating their slices and looking scared out of their minds.
- |
  

- I guess they live way out in the country or something, so I bet the big city blew their minds.
- |
  

- Winnie was really happy around them, though.
- |
  

- I guess that's good, since he's just been sitting around here moping all the time and staring out the window.
- |
  

- He should just leave and spend  all  his time with them.
- March 26
- Three times this week, Winnie's asked if I want to join him for a picnic or maybe an adventure.
- |
  

- No thanks, I tell him very pointedly, I have a lot of work to do.
- |
  

- He just sighs and walks off on his own.
- |
  

- Silly old bear.
- March 30
- It's Robin.
- |
  

- Walt Robin, the V.P.
- |
  

- That's how Winnie got the job.
- |
  

- Apparently, Winnie has some sort of relationship with Robin's grandson or nephew or something.
- |
  

- That's what Kirk told me, and he knows someone in H.R.
- |
  

- Frankly, I wonder if that's going to be enough to let Winnie stick around.
- |
  

- He showed up three hours late today and gave this long story about being chased by bees.
- |
  

- Then he brought out another honey pot (his cubicle is covered with empty ones), ate the honey with his hands for a while, and passed out on his desk.
- |
  

- I mean, it's so far beyond just not contributing to the workload at this point.
- |
  

- It's unhygienic for us, and he's so clearly not healthy.
- |
  

- Someone should do something.
- |
  

- The little bitch Tami from marketing came by to rub his tummy.
- |
  

- Unbelievable.
- April 6
- Winnie hasn't shown up in three days.
- |
  

- I figured he called in sick, but I guess no one's heard anything.
- |
  

- He has no phone, so no one's been able to reach him.
- April 7
- H.
- R.
- |
  

- Winnie's house, since I'm his best friend at the company (sad).
- |
  

- I followed the directions and found him in this hollowed-out tree where he apparently lives.
- |
  

- He must have offered me honey like 12 times.
- |
  

- I have to admit, he looked happier than he ever did at work.
- |
  

- I asked if he was planning on coming back to work, but he just said that the office was "quite an adventure" but that he was "glad to be home.
- "\" He really is a nice guy, but I think it's better for everyone that it's over."
- |
  

- He told me to come back and visit sometime and I lied and said I would.

  H.R. asked me to drive out to Winnie's house, since I'm his best friend at the company (sad). I followed the directions and found him in this hollowed-out tree where he apparently lives. He must have offered me honey like 12 times. I have to admit, he looked happier than he ever did at work.
