  NEW YORK, Oct. 6/PRNewswire/ -- Beings unique and "your own person" is 
  extremely important, but a mixture of some practicality and dependability is 
  necessary for today's twentysomethings (or Gen Xers), a Mazda Protege Poll of 
  this group found.  Sixty-five percent of twentysomethings consider themselves 
  to be "out-of-the-box" individuals and define this concept as thinking 
  creatively, taking risks, and being independent.
  The national Yankelovich survey, sponsored by Mazda in anticipation of the 
  first-ever Mazda Protege Out-Of-The-Box (OOTB) Awards, celebrates the launch 
  of the all-new 1999 Mazda Protege and honors the most OOTB celebrities named 
  in the poll.  The awards program includes a national search to find and honor 
  America's most out-of-the-box individuals -- people from all walks of life 
  who think and act independently, and find creative solutions to life and work 
  challenges.
  The survey found twentysomethings believe in creating opportunities to meet 
  their needs, with 52 percent planning to take their dreams and invent a job 
  to go along with them, versus 42 percent who say they'll find their dream 
  job.  Almost all are committed to making their goals a reality -- 91 percent 
  of twentysomethings believe they will eventually gain what they want in life.
  "Twentysomethings are balancing both fun and responsibility in life, and as 
  the Mazda Protege Poll found, 68 percent of this group want to buy products 
  that fit their own personal style as they mature into their twenties and 
  beyond," said Richard Beattie, Mazda North American operations president and 
  chief executive officer.  "For today's young, succeeding individuals aspiring 
  to live life on their own terms, the Mazda Protege offers them a 
  non-conformist, out-of-the-box choice, while being efficient and dependable.  
  With its combinations of style, reliability and spirited performance, we 
  think the Protege is the car to carry them through."
  As a testament to their autonomous spirit, 57 percent of twentysomethings 
  says they enjoy going for a drive just to be on the road, with no particular 
  destination in mind.  When they're in their cars, 62 percent listen to a

  impacted this generation include:  the emergence of the Internet (52 
  percent), the growth of television (36 percent) and the struggle to save the 
  environment as well as the changes facing the "nuclear family" (32 percent).
  The following celebrities were named by twentysomethings as America's most 
  Out-Of-The-Box people in their respective specialties:  Jim Carrey and Drew 
  Barrymore (movies); Courtney Love (music); Dennis Rodman and Venus Williams 
  (sports); Jenna Elfman, Michael Richards and Drew Carey (TV); Donatella
