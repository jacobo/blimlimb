- Two years ago, I was in a car wreck in Chicago that pushed my front bumper into the rear bumper of the leased red Mercedes in front of me at a stoplight.
- |
  

- My chance encounter with the driver (and exchange of insurance information) led me to thinking about Naperville, the western suburb where he lived.
- |
  

- Everyone was fine, and the bumper was quickly repaired.
- |
  

- That car wreck took me on a spiritual journey, out here to I-290's junction with I-88.
- I'd started driving through this horrible bottleneck near Naperville, sometimes as often as three times a day, just to see it, and if I wasn't doing anything important.
- |
  

- Every roll through put me cheek-by-jowl with dozens of road workers pouring asphalt, waving plastic flags -- even using several handy Port-a-Potties lined up on the shoulder.
- |
  

- Sometimes we'd high-five.
- One morning, driving toward the bottleneck to watch my friends pour asphalt, I was listening to the local NPR affiliate, and I learned that cuts in state transportation funding had jeopardized their Port-a-Potties.
- |
  

- The things we take for granted in life are always the most vulnerable to progress.
- I pulled to the side of the road and began to cry.
- |
  

- I connected with a higher purpose for my life.
- |
  

- These Port-a-Potties were being made redundant, and I wanted to do something.
- |
  

- Then this guy operating a steamroller shouted out to me that he was looking for a volunteer to do a Port-a-Potty-sit as a protest.
- |
  

- I honked my horn -- "Pick me, pick me!
- "\" I thought I was going to be inside it for three weeks to a month."
- But I have been living in a 24-cubic foot, eight-year-old Port-a-Potty -- now known to the world as Vishnu -- since December 14, 1997.
- |
  

- It's about eight miles west of Chicago, on federal land.
- |
  

- It's a little stuffy here in the summertime, and a little sad and dark in the winter.
- |
  

- But I can always take solace in the sound of cars rolling past me, like the ceaseless ocean tide.
- Eighteen months ago I built a small shelf, a foot below the ceiling.
- |
  

- That serves as a storage space, and leaves me about six feet for myself.
- |
  

- The construction crew brings food and supplies once a week.
- |
  

- They open the door, and I hand them a bag of waste and accept their supplies and fresh fruit.
- |
  

- I have a small Dutch oven, but it's very dangerous to use in here, so I try to consume my food in its unaltered  state.
- |
  

- I collect water from the fog and the snow and the ice.
- I go to the bathroom like everyone else.
- It's funny -- I never imagined when I opened the door to this Port-a-Potty that I was going to ask for a cell phone, an iBook with a DVD player, a Palm Pilot, two fountain pens, a set of cocktail glasses, a microwave oven, a corkscrew, and a three-gallon institutional-size can of tomato juice.
- |
  

- But they also gave me a flashlight with a can opener and a two-inch TV screen in it, which I asked for, and a free pocket calculator, which I did not.
- There is no average day when you live in a Port-a-Potty.
- |
  

- Sometimes I surf the Web for 10 hours a day, looking at Illinois and Chicago government transportation sites--and MSNBC.
- |
  

- After all, if Springfield changes its mind and decides not to cut the funds, I'll be pleased to go back to my apartment, if my landlady hasn't evicted me.
- |
  

- I'm also answering letters, maybe a hundred a week, and occasionally I field calls from Mancow Muller, the deejay on the Morning Zoo radio show.
- |
  

- He always asks if I'm taking a dump.
- |
  

- That's OK -- I can take the jokes.
- But the first 18 months were pretty hard.
- |
  

- I missed being able to stand up straight, to see my friends, to drive on I-290 whenever the urge hit me.
- |
  

- On the other hand, I was dry and warm and safe, and the construction guys would give me updates about what was going on with the Department of Transportation.
- |
  

- Still, the city threatened to arrest me, I had a helicopter hovering over my Port-a-Potty, and I sometimes got pummeled with 15-mile-an-hour winds.
- One night I thought I was going to die.
- |
  

- The rain, the wind, the howling.
- |
  

- Imagine sitting at the top of a redwood tree in the middle of a squall with 90-mile-an-hour winds, while you're riding a bucking bronco and trying to land a light twin-propeller aircraft onto the deck of a ship that's getting tossed on a stormy sea -- then sort of reduce all that danger by half or a third or so, and put it into a Port-a-Potty.
- |
  

- Emotionally, mentally, spiritually, cut off from the only people who care whether I live or die -- the construction guys, who'd all gone home for the night.
- I grabbed Vishnu and started praying.
- |
  

- "Then Vishnu said: \"Think of Port-a-Potties during crowded outdoor events."
- |
  

- They open, they close, they flush, they open and close again and again.
- |
  

- Their work is never finished.
- |
  

- And you, too -- your work is not yet finished.
- "\" I passed out."
- |
  

- And when I woke up, I couldn't hear anything, except the cars and steamrollers and construction guys talking to each other about where to pour the asphalt.
- That was a turning point.
- |
  

- I was no longer afraid.
- |
  

- My love is my power.
- |
  

- You can't take that away from me.
- |
  

- But this eight-year-old Port-a-Potty is not protected.
- |
  

- I look forward to getting out, to feeling the hot asphalt under my feet, but until Vishnu is safe, I will stay here.

  Two years ago, I was in a car wreck in Chicago that pushed my front
  bumper into the rear bumper of the leased red Mercedes in
  front of me at a stoplight. My chance encounter with the driver (and

  about Naperville, the western suburb where he lived. (Everyone was
  fine,

  took me on a spiritual journey, out here to I-290's junction with I-88.
  I'd started driving through this horrible bottleneck near Naperville,
  sometimes as often as three times a day, just to see it, and
  if I wasn't doing anything important. Every roll through put me
  cheek-by-jowl with dozens of road workers pouring asphalt,
  waving plastic flags -- even using several handy Port-a-Potties lined
  up
  on the shoulder. Sometimes we'd high-five.
  One morning, driving toward the bottleneck to watch my friends pour
  asphalt, I was listening to the local NPR affiliate, and I
  learned that cuts in state transportation funding had jeopardized their
  Port-a-Potties. The things we take for granted in life are
  always the most vulnerable to progress.
