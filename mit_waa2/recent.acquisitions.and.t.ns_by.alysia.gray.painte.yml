- Mary Copeland Tet, the daughter of American immigrants, was famed for her curly hair, grey since adolescence, and her lifelong pleading for the mysterious "Carl" to return and work out their relationship woes.  Subject matter favored by Tet prior to her marriage included the great waterworks of British Columbia as well as her lauded "Earth Hurts (now I know my ABC's)" series.

- Sculptures after her brief union with Carl include "Our Bed, Empty," "Carl's Pants Without Carl in Them," and the striking, oversized six-pack titled "He Said He Was Going Out For Some Beer," a finalist at the 1967 Oslo Conference.

- One of three panels from a palace of the fourth Desert Kingdom, this work depicts a bird with the head of a girl drinking near a lotus.

- The girl-headed bird has long been believed to be a minor deity of this period, and researchers are attempting to verify this thesis by deciphering the enigmatic cuneiform-like writing at the bottom left of the panel.

"Carl&#151;Please Call Me When You See This Sculpture" is a giant white hand missing the index finger, which historians believe may symbolize the absent Carl.  It is not known if Carl saw the sculpture before Tet's death in 1985.
