- I'm not doing it.
- |
  

- I'm just not.
- |
  

- "I know I say the same thing every year, but this time I mean it\x97I am not playing it this year."
- |
  

- Seriously, how many times can I possibly be expected to play that stupid song?
- |
  

- I bet if you counted the number of times I've played it over the years, it probably adds up to, like, a jillion.
- |
  

- I'm not even exaggerating.
- |
  

- One  jillion  times.
- |
  

- Well, not this year.
- This year, I'm just going to say, "Sorry, folks, I'm only playing holiday songs tonight.
- "\" Yeah, that's a good plan."
- |
  

- That's definitely what I'm going to do, and if they don't like it, tough cookies.
- |
  

- It'll just be tough cookies for them.
- But I know exactly what'll happen.
- |
  

- I'll sit down, play a few holiday songs, and then some drunk jerk will yell out, "'Piano Man,'" and everybody will start clapping, and I'll look like a real asshole if I don't play it.
- I wonder if they'll have shrimp cocktail.
- Now that I think of it, it's always Bob Schimke who yells out, "'Piano Man.
- |
  

- "\" He does it every year."
- |
  

- He gets a couple of Scotches in that fat gut of his, and then it's, "
- Hey, Billy, play 'Piano Man'!
- "\" That guy is such a dick."
- |
  

- He thinks he's such a big shot because he manages that stupid hedge fund.
- |
  

- Big deal.
- |
  

- He thinks because he used to play quarterback for Amherst that everybody should give a shit.
- |
  

- I don't.
- |
  

- Who cares about you and your stupid hedge fund, Bob?
- |
  

- That's what I should say to him this year.
- |
  

- I really should.
- |
  

- I should just march right up to him and say, "
- Who cares about your stupid hedge fund, you dick?
- "\" Let's just see what Mr. Quarterback has to say about that."
- |
  

- And I know he made a pass at Christie that time.
- |
  

- "She probably liked it\x97that's probably why she denied it even happened."
- I'm such a loser.
- Why do I even go to these parties?
- |
  

- I mean, honestly, how many times do I need to see Trish and Steve and Lily and that creepy doctor husband of hers and all their rich Long Island friends?
- |
  

- Although that Greenstein girl is nice.
- |
  

- Maybe she'll be there.
- |
  

- "What's her name\x97Alison?"
- What if Alison asks me to play "Piano Man"? Then what? I've got to stick to my guns, that's what. I'll simply say, "Some other time.
- "\" Yeah, that's good."
- |
  

- Kind of like we're making a date or something.
- |
  

- And then at the end of the night when we're all getting our coats, I'll turn to her and say something like, "
- So when do you want to get together and hear 'Piano Man'?
- "\" Oh man, that's really good."
- |
  

- That's so smooth.
- |
  

- After all, how is she going to say no?
- |
  

- She's the one who asked to hear it in the first place!
- |
  

- Oh man, Billy, that is just perfect.
- Maybe she'll say something like, "How about right now?
- "\" Yeah."
- |
  

- And maybe we'll leave together.
- |
  

- I can drive her back to my place and I can play her the stupid song and then maybe we'll do it.
- |
  

- I'd really like to do it with that Greenstein girl.
- |
  

- How awesome would that be?
- |
  

- Me leaving with Alison on my arm and Bob's big fat stupid face watching us go.
- |
  

- That would be too rich.
- |
  

- "I'd be real nonchalant about it, too\x97\""
- See you later, Bob.
- Who am I kidding?
- |
  

- She'd never go out with me.
- |
  

- She was dating that actor for a while.
- |
  

- What's his name?
- |
  

- Benicio?
- |
  

- What kind of name is Benicio?
- |
  

- A stupid name, that's what kind.
- |
  

- Hi, I'm Benicio.
- |
  

- I'm so cool.
- |
  

- I'm sooooo cool.
- |
  

- I should start going by Billicio.
- |
  

- I'm Billicio Del Joelio.
- |
  

- I play pianolo.
- Sing us a song, you're the piano man .
- |
  

- Oh great.
- |
  

- Now it's in my head.
- |
  

- Perfect.
- |
  

- Now I have to walk around that stupid party with that stupid song stuck in my head all night.
- Amherst sucks at football.
- You know what I should do?
- |
  

- I should just turn this car around and go home.
- |
  

- Just pick up the phone and call them and tell them I ate some bad fish or something.
- |
  

- Yeah, that's what I should do.
- |
  

- This party's going to suck anyway.
- |
  

- By the time I get there, all the shrimp cocktail will probably be gone anyway.
- What am I going to do?
- |
  

- Go through my entire life avoiding situations where somebody might ask me to play a song?
- |
  

- I can't do that.
- |
  

- No, Billy, you've just got to grow yourself a sack and take care of business.
- |
  

- And if that loudmouth Bob Schimke requests "Piano Man," I just need to look him in the eye and tell him I'd be happy to play it for him just as soon as he goes ahead and fucks himself.
- Who am I kidding?
- |
  

- Of course I'm going to play it.
- |
  

- I always play it.
- |
  

- Probably the only reason half the people at that party even show up is to hear me play "Piano Man.
- "\" They probably don't even like me."
- |
  

- Not really.
- |
  

- They just want to tell all their friends that Billy came and played "
- Piano Man.
- "\" Again."
- |
  

- Like I'm the loser who's  dying  to play it.
- |
  

- Whatever.
- Fine.
- |
  

- I'll do it, but not because  they  want me to, but because  I  want me to.
- |
  

- I'm not even going to wait for them to ask.
- |
  

- I'm going to march right in there and play the song and that'll be that.
- |
  

- I'm not even going to take off my coat first.
- |
  

- Yeah.
- |
  

- Let's see what Bob has to say about that.
- |
  

- I might even play it twice.
