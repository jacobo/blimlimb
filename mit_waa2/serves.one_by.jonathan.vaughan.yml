  INGREDIENTS:
  1 birthday falling on Saturday, yours.
  1 unwelcome slide into consciousness.
  3 attempts to find reason to get out of bed.
  1 threadbare dressing gown.
  1 empty house, rented yet sincere.
  2 items post, freshly picked from doormat.
  1 card from father, containing 20 pound note and weak stab at humour.
  1 lumpy jiffy bag, taped up so as to make impossible to breach with bare
  hands.
  1 resigned wander into kitchen.
  1 stubbed toe, big.
  1 pair scissors, large enough to make half-hearted but sufficient attack on
  jiffy bag.
  1 eggcup from mother, who has forgotten that it's sister that likes eggs.
  You do not like eggs.
  1 perky-looking signature on mother's card, from her new partner.
  1 living room chair, slumped into.
  3 hours utterly meaningless TV.
  1 shower, aimless and overlong.
  1 walk into town, rainy.
  1 large bar chocolate, purchased with 20 pound note.
  1 latent alcohol dependency issue.
  1 remaining grandmother who believes you don't eat enough vegetables, and
  who, without fail, drops by when you are out.
  2 carrots with accompanying soil, wrapped in newspaper, stuffed through letterbox.
  1 depressing return home.
  1 sad and misguided attempt to cook meal for self.
  1 tablespoon sugar scraped with difficulty from 2 lb. bag purchased about three years ago for something that required sugar (pasta sauce
  perhaps?) and haven't touched since, so has gone all hard, but is probably
  still OK, you think.
  1 unrequited and abortive love affair from six or maybe seven years back,
  dealt with at the time and therefore holding no emotional potency.
  1 onion, halved, with pips removed.
  1 urgent need for music to distract self from grim reality of cooking task.
  1 chicken, grated.
  1 old tape radio music which you are unaware contains "Stay (I Missed You)"
  by Lisa Loeb, about four songs in, a song which six or seven years back was
  being played on the radio All The Time.
  9 minutes of grace.
  100ml tears from unexpected and uncontrollable bout of sobbing brought on by opening chords of fourth song and lasting well into the next, and
  beyond.
  1 bottle grim whisky kept for use only in emergencies.
  1 turn of volume knob (upward).
  1/2 bar chocolate.
  1 well-meaning neighbour with phenomenal memory for dates who remembers
  party you had exactly two years ago&nbsp;&#151; when you still had some friends&nbsp;&#151; and
  decides to drop by, just to say hi.
  2 carrots, unwrapped.
  4 knocks on door, unheard.
  3 sheets newspaper, dismembered.
  1 test of door handle.
  2 carrots, washed and peeled with blurred vision.
  1 tentative entrance.
  2 carrots, chopped with a hatred and bitterness that wells up inside you
  like screaming fire.
  1 chirpy "Hello?," still unheard.
  16 large marks in chopping board. Bit carried away there.
  1 comforting hand laid on shoulder.
  1 startled turn with unintentionally tight grip on sharp knife.
  3 long seconds gasping eye contact.
  1 whole lot of blood.
  15 minutes seated at table in tear-stained stupor, gazing at light's reflection
  in whisky bottle, and at dark slick growing around body on floor.
  1 long, hard birthday think.
