- The campaign itself has been relatively short and so grassroots electioneering has been critical.

- Much of the effort has gone to door-to-door canvassing and colorful signs for candidates to display in the yards and windows of their supporters.
- Now these signs aren't very big, which is a problem for some candidates, specifically Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, who must print his last name in very small letters.

- This puts him at a great disadvantage to more recognizable, large-print rivals like Audie Bock and Paul Nave.
- Now imagine how difficult it would be for Arnold if he had to campaign with a running mate.

- It would be much easier if the first name of the candidate for lieutenant governor shared a few letters with Arnold's last name.

- "For instance, if he were running alongside the former star of TV's  Major Dad , the sign would read:"
- "\"Arnold SchwarzenegGerald McRaney\""
- "Or, if Gary Coleman wanted to run with Albanian Actress Ema Ndoja, they could be:"
- "\"Gary ColEmaNdoja\""
- Below, you will find the first two letters of the first name of potential candidates, and the last two letters of the last names of their potential running mates.

- California election rules require all candidates and their running mates be television or movie actors.
- |
  

- They do not require, however, that the candidates be living, or even for the candidates to have been on this Earth at the same time.

- The names of candidates and their running mates  must share at least three letters.

- In some cases there may be more than one correct answer.
