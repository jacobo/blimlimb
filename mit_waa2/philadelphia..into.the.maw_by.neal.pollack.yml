- As the Democratic National Convention begins in Los Angeles, we at  McSweeney's have decided to pay attention to a matter of important national  interest that has been more or less, though not entirely, ignored by the  major media.

- Since the November 1999 WTO riots in Seattle, various local  police departments and an amorphous culture of protesters have been at war,  with no definite result as yet.
- |
  

- We believe that these battles between police  and protesters are events of historical significance that test the very  limits of our society's tolerance for dissent.
- |
  

- These are serious times, and  these protests will eventually have serious consequences.
- Recently, Neal Pollack went to Philadelphia to cover the Republican National  Convention and the protests surrounding it, on assignment from a major glossy  American magazine.
- |
  

- He wrote a very long story of which he was quite proud.
- |
  

- For various reasons, none of which were unreasonable, the magazine rejected  his piece.
- |
  

- However, at McSweeney's, we are not concerned about such things as  timeliness, and are certainly not concerned with length.
- |
  

- Therefore, we will  present Pollack's piece nearly in full, and with great pride.
- Pollack's work on this site, and in his new book The Neal Pollack Anthology  of American Literature, are only a part of his large body of work.
- |
  

- Pollack  has been reporting on urban-affairs issues for many years in publications  like the Chicago Reader, Salon, The New Republic, and The New York Times  Magazine.
- |
  

- He is a real person, and this piece, which will be presented in  eight or so installments, is also real.
- |
  

- The events described within really happened, and no names have been changed.
- |
  

- Again, they are the real experiences of a real person.

- Now, please, no more  explanations.
