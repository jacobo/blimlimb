- We really love the work in this issue, and are honored that the writers allowed us to bring it to you.

  Issue 9 will be sent to subscribers and bookstores very soon. Issue 9
  needed to get out in a hurry because there are two pieces &#151; one by Gabe
  Hudson, one by A.M. Homes &#151; that are in collections in bookstores soon,
  if not already, so we'd promised to get the issues out in advance of their
  books.
  We did our best. Because our usual printer was very busy with the new
  novel we just published, for the first time, we printed the journal in
  America. Well, the results are mixed. There is a really strange endpaper
  color that we can't remember choosing, and on the advance copies we received
  the binding was a little suspect. We can't tell you that from a production
  aspect &#151; something we take great interest in &#151; that this is our
  best issue. But the cover turned out well &#151; it's a throwback to the
  first three issues &#151; and the back cover painting, by Scott Greene, is
  really stunning, we think. This is our first paperback since Issue 3, and is
  priced accordingly and affordably at $15.
  The good news is that the content is of the highest caliber, with superb
  contributions from regulars like Denis Johnson, William T. Vollmann, Roy
  Kesey, Homes and Hudson, and newcomers Ellen Moore, Nathaniel Minton, K. Kvashay-Boyle, Jeff
  Greenwald, Doug Dorst, Val Vinokurov, and in all likelihood, this will be
  our last foray away from the sure hands of the printers at Oddi Printing of

  We hope you'll like this issue. There is some fantastic writing inside,
  all sharing a quick pulse and great passion. We really love the work in this
  issue, and are honored that the writers allowed us to bring it to you.
