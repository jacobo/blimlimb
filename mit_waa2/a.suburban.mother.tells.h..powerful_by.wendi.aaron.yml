  Gang Name\n\
  Let's start with what you and your \"homies\" call yourselves. It needs to be something tough. Menacing. For example, \"Crips,\" \"Bloods,\" \"the Latin Kings\"\x97all \"badass.\" Your name, \"the Wildflower Estates Mafia,\" while geographically accurate, doesn't exactly make one grab one's purse and blow one's rape whistle. I know you're creative, Jeremy. Remember when you spray-painted \"NOT A MILF\" on my fence? Use that great imagination of yours and come up with a name that's just a bit more intimidating.
