- By the time the people at the next campsite told us about the swimming hole, it was three days into our trip, and we had given up on a lot of things, but somehow, the thought of a swimming hole gave the four of us hope.

- It conjured visions of shade trees and rope swings, laughter, reconciliation.

- To get there, we just had to follow the path through the woods, walk through a clearing to the edge of a thicket.

- It was about ten feet in.

- We couldn't miss it.
- The four of us changed into the underwear we had brought that most resembled swimsuits.

- Ryan and I left our glasses behind, nestled in a sweatshirt and placed out of the way.

- We linked arms and alternately kept our eyes downward and forward, on the lookout for sharp stones and other hazards.

- It wasn't long before we could barely hear their shouts.
- The clearing was covered in thistle and foul weeds with serrated leaves.

- We clutched at one another, stepping cautiously, each movement deliberate and considered.

- I looked up just in time to see them duck into the woods.
- "\"They should be helping us,\""

- I said.
- "\"They want to be alone,\""

- Ryan said.
- |
  

- "\"Thistle."

- Step left.
- I didn't want to think about this anymore, and so I said, "I heard you last night, talking to Annie on the picnic table.
- "\" He had told her about stars, their names, to what constellations they belonged, and how far away they are."
- |
  

- He talked until the words didn't matter anymore; the cumulative effect of this information was somehow love.
- |
  

- It was the nicest thing I'd ever heard.
- |
  

- I fell asleep listening to him.
- "\"I know,\""
- |
  

- "\"I could hear you listening."
- |
  

- Partly I was talking to you, too.
- "\"Thistle,\""
- |
  

- I said, "Watch your right foot.
- |
  

- Step toward me.
- The swimming hole was only a little farther.
- |
  

- Somehow I knew what it would look like.
- |
  

- It had a mud bottom that, when disturbed, rose up in thick clouds, and there were toads.
- |
  

- To swim in it, everybody had to close their eyes.
