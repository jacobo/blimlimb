- Mowing the lawn naked.

- Cars honk as they drive by.
- |
  

- I smile and wave.
- |
  

- The front wheels catch a root.
- |
  

- I push the mower up and walk into the spinning blades, which are made of taffy.
- |
  

- I'm on a date in a Paris cafe.
- |
  

- The woman I'm lunching with calls me a name I don't understand.
- |
  

- I look the word up in my phrase book.
- |
  

- There's no definition, just a telephone number.
- |
  

- I dial the number and speak to an American man whose voice I recognize from educational filmstrips in the 1970s.
- |
  

- He tells me he'll drop by to tell me the definition sometime tomorrow between 5 a.m.
- |
  

- I prepare to wait.
- |
  

- I'm driving with my college economics professor, an old chain-smoker with rheumy eyes and a tubercular cough.
- |
  

- It's a tiny little Pepsi-can of a car, and I'm driving barefoot.
- |
  

- My professor stares straight ahead, eyes unblinking, a white rabbit in his lap.
- |
  

- There are no roads, just tall grass buffeted by breezes.
- |
  

- I can't wait to walk in it, feel the dew on my feet.
- |
  

- I pull over at the edge of a football stadium parking lot.
- |
  

- Thousands of fans funnel through the gates.
- |
  

- We get out of the car.
- |
  

- I tell him he can't bring the rabbit inside.
- |
  

- My professor looks at the animal for the first time then releases the rabbit.
- |
  

- It leaps into the grass and is gone.
- |
  

- I'm watching myself water ski on a placid lake.
- |
  

- My muscles are taut.
- |
  

- My skin is tan and smooth.
- |
  

- I look really good in my swim trunks.
- |
  

- Back and forth I navigate the wake on my slalom ski with a new trick for each crossing.
- |
  

- The boat picks up speed as we approach the red ramp.
- |
  

- I'm really moving now.
- |
  

- I hit the ramp and grab massive air, when, suddenly, a tree shoots out of the lake.
- |
  

- I hit the trunk and slide down into the water.
- |
  

- It looks like it hurts, but I shake it off.
- I'm watching myself water ski on a placid lake.
- |
  

- Sailing the seven seas with Popeye.
- |
  

- A tri-master appears on the horizon, flying the skull and crossbones.
- |
  

- Captain Brutus and his crew of long-armed, half-naked goons board the ship.
- |
  

- Through strength, skill with cutlasses and canned spinach, we repel the pirates and make off with a chest filled with gleaming coins.
- |
  

- Popeye hands me my share of the loot in a sack with a dollar sign on it.
- |
  

- When I remind Popeye it's only a dream, he suggests we put the money under my pillow so it will be there when I wake up.
- |
  

- Dizzy with greed, I find no fault in this plan.
- "In the morning, I check under my pillow: no loot again."
- |
  

- I'm swimming through a series of underwater caves.
- |
  

- Somehow there is light.
- |
  

- An unearthly sound guides me to an ancient grotto.
- |
  

- A man dressed all in white sits at an organ carved from a stalagmite.
- |
  

- The music is faintly nostalgic, stirring sentimental urges I didn't know I'd been harboring.
- |
  

- I long for the sweet smell of fresh hay, even though I've never been to a farm.
- |
  

- I crave roasted nuts, mulled cider, an over-sized sweater.
- |
  

- If I had a stick, I'd throw it, recalling with great fondness autumn days and a dog that never was.
- |
  

- The music stops.
- |
  

- Applause washes over me.
- |
  

- I turn and find myself on a stage before thousands of adoring fans.
- |
  

- I'm not naked, but I so want to be.
- |
  

- I'm in an abandoned brewery.
- |
  

- Trench-coated gangsters have got me bound in chains from head to toe.
- |
  

- I'm hoisted upside down over a cold vat of Guinness.
- |
  

- Where's Popeye when I need him?
- |
  

- The men laugh maniacally as I'm slowly lowered into the stout.
- |
  

- No one comes to my rescue.
