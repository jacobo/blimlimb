- Some people, when they're depressed, seek solace in viewing the faces of small children or animals.
- |
  

- Others find comfort in the gentle murmur of waves upon the shore or the sylvan sounds of a babbling brook.
- |
  

- Not me.
- |
  

- Nothing lifts my spirits like a pile of wood.
- |
  

- When I'm down I head for a skid full of two-by-fours.
- I like working with my hands.
- |
  

- When I need to clear my mind, I'll pound nails into a plank just to relax.
- |
  

- I've worked with pine, oak, walnut, spruce, even zebrawood and cocobolo.
- |
  

- Name a type of wood, and I've probably drilled a hole in it.
- Recently, I decided to fix up my apartment.
- |
  

- I thought I'd put up some paneling, or maybe make some bookshelves.
- My project turned out to be very ambitious.
- |
  

- I bought so much lumber there wasn't enough room to store it in my apartment.
- |
  

- I decided to put it outside, close to my back door.
- |
  

- I live on the ground floor, and there's an area under my back porch that is dry, spacious, and partially concealed.
- I continued to work, and it gave me great satisfaction.
- |
  

- But shortly after the commencement of my task, a problem occurred.
- |
  

- At first, I thought it was my imagination, but it wasn't.
- |
  

- Someone was helping himself to my lumber.
- He wasn't stealing a large amount.
- |
  

- It wasn't even my best lumber, just odds and ends, scraps that I had cut from a piece of paneling or a plank.
- |
  

- Nonetheless, it perturbed me to think that someone was invading my space and taking my lumber.
- A few days later, the bold thief helped himself to a six-foot two-by-twelve.
- |
  

- I'd developed a particular fondness for that two-by-twelve, and I was very upset by its loss.
- |
  

- In fact, it really ticked me off.
- I lay in bed motionless, listening to the sounds of the night, trying to discern if there were any irregularities in my backyard.
- |
  

- I live in an area of the city where there are a lot of bars and tourist traffic.
- |
  

- Drunks are always shouting and making noise, but nonetheless, I attuned my ears for the possible sounds of my lumber being disturbed.
- |
  

- The thief's arrogance gnawed at me.
- |
  

- I worked hard for my money and bought good lumber with it.
- |
  

- Now I'd probably have to bring it back inside my apartment because some guy was ripping me off.
- I wouldn't have an inch to maneuver.
- |
  

- I would be tripping all over the stuff.
- |
  

- I decided I would not capitulate.
- |
  

- I would hold my ground.
- The next day, I tacked a note to the remaining pile of boards.
- |
  

- It read, "To whoever is stealing my lumber.
- |
  

- Don't.
- |
  

- Listen to your conscience.
- |
  

- Please cease and desist.
- The following night the thief stole the two-by-four, and the note.
- "I was fuming and wrote another note: \"Oh, lumber thief, go ahead, enjoy another piece of my lumber, because I know soon you will die."
- I sat in the darkness of my kitchen, silent, motionless.
- |
  

- My ears were poised to intercept any sound that might be that of my avowed enemy, the lumber thief.
- |
  

- Like a desert fox, I listened to the sounds of the evening unfold.
- |
  

- I heard the merry antics of bar-hoppers and passersby.
- |
  

- This night was a busy one.
- |
  

- There was a great deal of foot traffic.
- The next morning the second note and more lumber were gone.
- After night fell, I lay alone in the darkness.
- |
  

- I was about ready to fall asleep when my ears picked up a rustling in my backyard.
- |
  

- The sound was coming from where my lumber was stored.
- |
  

- I alighted my bed.
- The fateful showdown had arrived.
- |
  

- In a few seconds I would be savoring the ultimate confrontation on the battlefield of good and evil.
- |
  

- I snapped on my Kevlar bulletproof vest.
- |
  

- I loaded the hollow points into my .
- |
  

- Smith-and-Wesson revolver.
- |
  

- Soon my adversary would be standing in front of me and I would saying, "You pathetic, sniveling, degenerate sneak thief.
- |
  

- You lowlife.
- |
  

- I'm going to have my way with you.
- I opened the door and stepped into the darkness.
- |
  

- In the shadows an intruder lurked.
- |
  

- The veins in my neck were bulging like garden hoses.
- |
  

- I cocked the hammer of my revolver and snapped on the back porch light.
- The face of my prey congealed into a frightened, timid ball.
- |
  

- It wasn't the lumber thief, however; it was a prostitute blowing a trick.
- I was so angry I blurted out, "Get one drop of come on my lumber, and I'll kill both of you!
- Well, you should have seen the look on their faces.
- |
  

- I could just imagine what was racing through their minds.
- |
  

- They were probably thinking, "This guy is pretty sensitive about his lumber.
- Yes, I am pretty sensitive about my lumber.
- They looked at me, their eyes a mixture of fear and terror.
- |
  

- Obviously, these two were not the culprits.
- |
  

- I was disappointed that I'd been deprived of my confrontation with the thief.
- |
  

- But I also felt badly that I'd spoken so aggressively, and I lowered my pistol.
- "\"I'm sorry I came on so strong,\""
- |
  

- I said, pointing to the pile of boards.
- |
  

- "\"It's just that these planks mean a lot to me."
- My self-reproach grew.
- |
  

- I said to the trick, pulling out my wallet, "How much is this costing you?
- The trick carefully watched my actions.
- |
  

- He said, "Uh, one hundred dollars.
- I thought, this guy is no shrewd shopper.
- |
  

- He must have been an out-of-towner.
- |
  

- Call me old-fashioned, but $100 seems pretty steep.
- I looked but didn't have one hundred dollars, so I gave him a fifty and said, "I'm sorry I burst in so suddenly.
- |
  

- I am not going to pay for the whole thing, but I will pay for half.
- |
  

- I believe that's fair.
- The trick's face brightened.
- "\"But,\""
- |
  

- I said, "Remember.
- |
  

- The prostitute said, "Not a drop.
- "\"That's right."
- The prostitute and the trick said they didn't have a problem with that.
- I'd done the right thing.
- |
  

- I felt so good that I wanted to offer the prostitute and the trick some lemonade or an iced tea.
- |
  

- Instead, I just said,  "Well, goodnight.
- |
  

- I'm going to bed now.
- They waved goodbye.
- |
  

- They seemed happy, and their happiness touched me.
- Alone in my bed, I was glad I hadn't shot them, or anyone, for that matter.
- |
  

- That would have been murder!
- |
  

- What if the lumber thief had been a little kid, pinching the lumber to build a tree house, or an art student, needing the wood for a blue-ribbon sculpture?
- |
  

- I could have gone to prison for murdering an art student.
