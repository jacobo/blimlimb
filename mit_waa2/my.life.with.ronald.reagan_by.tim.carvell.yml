  How well I remember that first meeting with Ronald Reagan, or
  "Nederlander," as we liked to call him. (Few will recall that
  "Nederlander"
  was Reagan's original nickname, before it was shortened to "Benelux,"
  and
  eventually, the far-better- known "Dutch.") He was coming off the
  football
  field at my alma mater, Dixon High, and he brushed by me. I turned to
  the
  guy next to me and said, "Who was that?"
  "That was Ronald Reagan," he said. "Say, you look awfully young to be
  here." "Yes," I said. "Well, at the moment, I'm an undescended egg in my
  
  grandmother's
  womb. And you are...?"
  "A sperm cell."
  "Oh."
  The next time I saw Reagan, it was 1942. I was a pretty young contract
  actress at Paramount named Jane Wyman. He was a ruggedly handsome star
  at
  the studio, and I'll never forget the day he walked into the studio
  canteen. Our eyes met.
  "Excuse me," he said. "Is that navy bean soup over there?"
  "Why yes," I said. "Yes, it is."
  "Super!" he exclaimed, a bit too loudly. Then there was a long,
  uncomfortable pause; both of us wanted to say something more, but
  neither
  of us knew quite what to say. Finally, he broke the silence. "Hey," he
  said. "Nice ass."
  The years flew by, and before I knew it, it was 1951. I was the chimp
  wrangler on "Bedtime for Bonzo", and oftentimes, after the day's filming
