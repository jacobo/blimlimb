title: A Review of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead
text: |-
  Yikes. Wow. Set aside the philosophical arguments. Please. "The
  Fountainhead" is a masterpiece, integrating theme and plot;
  characterization; and writing craftsmenship together in one tightly
  wrapped story that will remain in the hearts and minds of the American
  culture as the Mt. Rushmore of a New Age.
  An individual fighting for survival in a society that refuses to accept
  him. Feel his struggle. A successful young architect at the top of his
  field. Know his pain. A most desired women in love with the forbidden.
  See her beauty. A captain of the news world defending his position.
  Predict his fall. Love. Lust. Power. Greed. Sex. Betrayal. LIFE.
  I read The Fountainhead as a senior in high school as I passed through
  the most fantastic and emotional time of my life. When my english
  teacher first passed this book out in class I groaned at its size.
  Eventually, I read it. Every discription, every small word on every page
  made me wonder what I am doing on this earth and why no one understands
  me. I finished this book very late the night before I threw the shot put
  at the state meet in Denver as I tasted the best years of my life drift
  into nothingness.
  Reading this book is a lot like climbing a mountain. It is difficult to
  begin and requires a lot of willpower to continue. At some point in the
  book you would rather watch 'Might Morphine Power Rangers', then
  continue to put such a strain on your brain. You consistently find
  yourself on the verge ofquitting, but if you make it - WHAT A VIEW!!!

  Because of this book, I now proudly claim to be a Republican. (I am

  importantly, I feel better knowing that living for me and no one else
  will pay off. Ayn saw this; why can't we all.
  This is a great book to give as a gift to a loved one, for what better
  gift could one give a person, than the gift of their own life. it has a
  good love story about howard rourk and his girl freind plus it made me
  want to be a GREAT arcitect like howard rourk is in this book. but i
  have to give it three star's because howard rourk is pretty selfish he
  blows up some house's and once he even rape's his girl freind. my
  favorite caracter is peter keating who seem like a very nice man.
  Holy Crap this book is awesome!!
