- If there's one thing I'm tired of, it's hearing about how hard it is to have a baby.
- |
  

- I hate to break the news to you, but people have been having babies for literally billions of years.
- |
  

- In the olden days, women would have their babies right out there in the field, or on the back of a dinosaur, or, when we were still fish-people, right there in the stream.
- |
  

- Then they would put the new baby in a crib made of stones and let a brontosaurus watch it or whatever.
- But ask any modern pregnant woman whether she'd let a dinosaur watch her baby and she'll freak out as if you've just said the most outlandish thing ever.
- |
  

- I guess irrationality is just one of the many so-called symptoms of pregnancy.
- |
  

- Another symptom seems to be a case of the chubs.
- |
  

- I don't know if these women know this, but nobody likes a fat girl.
- |
  

- "Sure, I'd love to order the nachos and the onion rings and claim that I'm \"eating for two,\" but I guess I have something these pregnant women don't: self-respect."
- When they aren't busy eating, pregnant women are constantly crying or going to the bathroom.
- |
  

- They'll swear up and down that these are more of those famous pregnancy symptoms, but I watch television and I know that unstable women who constantly need to run to the bathroom are drug addicts.
- |
  

- Perhaps you remember a certain episode of  Saved by the Bell , when Jessie Spano got addicted to caffeine pills and Zack Morris had to stage an intervention to get her to stop the madness?
- |
  

- Well, every time one of these pill-addled fatties waddles down the hall toward the loo, I wish I had Zack's courage.
- And the worst part is that the endless complaining doesn't end after the baby is born.
- |
  

- Rather than appreciating the fact that they had a normal child in spite of the drugs and the reckless overeating, new parents go on and on about how hard child care is.
- |
  

- Everyone knows that kids love television and candy.
- |
  

- Yet I've met parents who refuse to give a baby candy or let it watch TV, and then complain when it cries.
- |
  

- Wouldn't you cry if someone took away your bourbon and cut your cable line just as  Desperate Housewives  was about to commence?
- |
  

- What if Eva Longoria said something especially sassy and you missed it?
- And then there are the babies themselves.
- |
  

- Try saying something polite to a baby, such as "How are you?
- "\" or \""
- Did you see  Lost  this week?
- |
  

- Were you surprised to find out what was in the hatch?
- "\" The baby will simply fix you with a cold, fishy stare and not reply at all."
- Listen, I don't want to brag, but I've done a lot of hard things in my life, and I'm tired of being told I have "no idea" what it's like to have a baby. Why, just last week my friend Carrie gave me a set of Calphalon pots and pans. These pots and pans are not machine washable, and you can only use nonmetal utensils with them or you'll risk scratching them. In short, my Calphalon pans are just as hard to take care of as a baby. But try pointing this out to a pregnant woman and the next thing you know, she's kicked you in the crotch.
