- I'm getting a little tired of peanuts.

- Every restaurant I've gone to in the last month has scattered peanuts all over my food.
- |
  

- Since when have peanuts become the gourmet topping of choice?
- |
  

- First it was desserts, but now they're on meat, too.
- And how did peanuts become such media whores?
- |
  

- You've seen the full-page ads in USA Today and the infomercials on late-night television, no doubt.

- I'm sick of it.
- |
  

- People walking around with peanuts clicking in their front pockets, bags of swaying peanuts hanging off their bikes, Boy Scouts even selling them.
- |
  

- Next we'll have everybody's uncle planting peanuts on every corner.
- I have no respect for peanuts.
- |
  

- I throw the shells on the floor.
- |
  

- I know many people who are actually allergic to peanuts, and let me tell you, they are not happy with what is going on.
- |
  

- They have to eat almond butter sandwiches and there is nothing wrong with that.
- |
  

- If they so much as touch a peanut their necks become scarred and, sometimes, drip with blood.
- |
  

- Am I the only one who is going to stand up against this ridiculous marketing trend?

- "I'm sure that old Peanut Joe is happy with his \"secret,\" his stock earnings, and his big gold pinkie rings, but this is obviously not good for America's image. It is a joke &#151; a laughing stock. My relatives in Canada are laughing their asses off. Right now. At our expense! Peanuts are demoralizing. Let me just say this: Stop eating peanuts."
- Stop eating peanuts.
