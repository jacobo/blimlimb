- My opening act was someone named, I think, Danny Eggar, a promising author who I am attempting to lift into prominence through my publishing connections.

- Considering his youth and lack of stage presence, he performed valiantly, but as usual, the evening was mine.

- As I read from my new collection,  The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature,  the audience acted as though it were gazing upon a new dawn.

- The stunned faces, the peals of laughter, the tearful applause, gave me mental insurance that the rest of this continent, my continent, will respond in the same way when I embark on a seven-month tour later this year.
- "During the question-and-answer period, a woman in the back, obscured by darkness, yelled, as is commonplace at my shows:"
- "\"Neal!"
- |
  

- Neal!
- |
  

- My friend likes you!
- "\"That's nice,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"My friend loves you!"
- "\"Well then,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"We must have a drink after the show."
- Such fans, I've discovered, usually don't have the courage to introduce themselves.
- |
  

- But this woman did approach me.
- |
  

- Her name was Lisa, and her "friend" had been a ruse. It was really Lisa that loved me, so much. She said that she worked for a magazine called  Vice,  which was published in Montreal. More specifically, she had recently written an article on the proper techniques for giving oral sex. I examined the illustrations, and the positions depicted were familiar to me. Other articles discussed the rise of a rock star with the unusual name of Beck, and a phenomenon known as "Pimp Chic.
- "\" It appeared that the young people of Toronto were dressing shabbily and using heroin on purpose, which I had always wanted to try myself, but had missed the curve in the late 60s, when I was covering Vietnam."
- |
  

- Lisa, it seemed, would be the perfect conduit to help me gain something for which I had been longing since those hoary days.
- "\"Do you possibly know where I could garner some, how do you say it, smack?"
- "\" I asked."
- Lisa's eyes narrowed.
- |
  

- Her mouth pursed.
- |
  

- From her bag, she pulled handcuffs.
- "\"You're under arrest, buddy,\""
- |
  

- This was unfair.
- |
  

- She was a cop.
- |
  

- And how was I supposed to know about an obscure statute, left over from days of the British occupation of Canada, which says it's illegal for you to ask a woman who's got a crush on you to buy you heroin?
- |
  

- The Canadians have such stupid laws.
- |
  

- But they have lovely jails.
- |
  

- Lisa drove me to the station, purring and stroking my hair all the way.
- |
  

- She left me in the hands of the desk sergeant.
- "\"We're really sorry to have to do this, Mr. Pollack,\""
- |
  

- "\"We're all such big fans of your work."
- |
  

- I particularly loved  Secrets of the Mystery Jew.
- They took me to a cell that was about the size of my hotel room, actually a little larger, I think.
- |
  

- There was a queen-sized bed with an eggshell mattress pad, a TV with cable reception and a Playstation, and an adjoining bathroom with whirlpool tub.
- |
  

- On the sink sat a collection of soaps and scented candles.
- "\"Please help yourself to this gift basket,\""
- |
  

- "\"courtesy of the Ontario Police Patrol."
- "\" That night, the guard brought me several delicious bottles of Upper Canada Nut-Blond Ale, and when it came time for lights-out, he provided me with a Bose white-noise wave machine."
- "\"To drown out the snoring of the other prisoners,\""
- |
  

- In the morning, my publicist Amy showed up, looking nervous and tired.
- |
  

- All night, she had been trying to convince the media hordes that my arrest had just been a "promotional stunt.
- "\" They believed her, because she is so good at publicity."
- |
  

- She found me playing a game of canasta with my captors.
- "\"Are you OK?"
- "\" she asked."
- "\"Ah, sure,\""
- |
  

- I said, using my best Canadian accent.
- Outside, my most fervent fans waited; they had pooled their nearly worthless Canadian dollars together for my bail.
- |
  

- I recognized them all.
- |
  

- First to greet me were the makeup artist Sid Armour and her hopeful writer husband Sean, who had recently celebrated their fifth anniversary.
- |
  

- Also present was Jonathan Carson, a political science graduate student at York University who had walked from his home in Chinatown to see to my release.
- |
  

- He was with his friend Wendy, who mysteriously described herself as "in the workforce.
- "\"I have brought you something,\""
- |
  

- Swith, which, I thought, had to be a pseudonym.
- I sniffed the package.
- |
  

- It was not "smack," as they called it, but rather an ounce of that delectable weed, oregano -- a local favorite. Ahhh. Sweet, sweet balm.
- I smoked merrily during the limo ride to the airport, and reflected on the time I had spent in Toronto.
- |
  

- They were among the most pleasant 20 hours of my life, despite my brief imprisonment.
- |
  

- Torontonians, as they strangely call themselves, are well-dressed, polite, inexpensive-apartment-starved creatures with a boundless passion for reading.
- |
  

- The people of Toronto are superior citizens of a lesser country, and as such, they need a champion in literature besides Margaret Atwood.
- I will be that person.
- |
  

- I will be that hero.
- Thank you, Toronto.
- I will return.
