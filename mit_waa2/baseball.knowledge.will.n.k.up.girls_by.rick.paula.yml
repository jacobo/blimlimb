- Can you believe this house?
- |
  

- Two fully stocked bars and completely free alcohol!
- |
  

- If David Wells lived here, he'd have 10 more perfect games!
- |
  

- What's that?
- |
  

- David Wells?
- |
  

- He's a pitcher.
- |
  

- Your boyfriend hates baseball?
- |
  

- He must hate America, too.
- |
  

- I would trade Albert Pujols  and  Vladimir Guerrero for a date with you.
- |
  

- Why are you laughing?
- |
  

- That's a combined 70 home runs a year!
- |
  

- This promotion does mean a lot more responsibility for you.
- |
  

- If people get out of line, you're going to have to discipline them now.
- |
  

- And all of the decisions have to be OK'd by you.
- |
  

- It's going to be stressful.
- |
  

- Do you want a back massage?
- |
  

- There.
- |
  

- That's better, isn't it?
- |
  

- Don't worry, it'll be OK.
- |
  

- Trust me, I know from experience.
- |
  

- How?
- |
  

- I've been commissioner of my fantasy baseball league for the past three years.
- |
  

- You know, it's awfully tough for me to give a good massage when you squirm away like that.
- |
  

- No, no.
- |
  

- You're not getting old.
- |
  

- Hell, you're only 27.
- |
  

- "Think of it this way: Since turning 27, Roger Clemens has won 280 games!"
- |
  

- You have your whole life ahead of you.
- |
  

- Please stop crying.
- |
  

- You're rarer than a five-tool catcher.
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- That's not gay slang for anything.
- |
  

- I'm talking about my fantasy baseball rotisserie league.
- |
  

- No. That's not a gay slang term, either.
- |
  

- That sure was quite the make-out session.
- |
  

- I've seen windows fog up in movies, but never in real life.
- |
  

- Goodness!
- |
  

- We really went at it, didn't we?
- |
  

- I forget the last time I felt so revved up.
- |
  

- Want to head inside?
- |
  

- You do?
- |
  

- Splendid!
- |
  

- Oh, wait.
- |
  

- "Now I remember the last time I felt so turned on: When I was able to snag Mark Prior with a sixth-round draft pick."
- |
  

- Yes, I'll take you home.
- |
  

- If my heart were made of bases, you'd be Scott Podsednik.
- |
  

- First, I must warn you about some weird red bumps you may encounter while down there.
- |
  

- It's not an infection or an STD or anything like that; it's just a few ingrown hairs from a poorly done shaving job.
- |
  

- I didn't really think anyone else would be seeing it.
- |
  

- As hard as it is to believe, I'm not a big lady's man.
- |
  

- Honestly.
- |
  

- Let's just say my scoreless streak was hitting Dontrelle Willis proportions before I met you tonight.
- |
  

- Wait.
- |
  

- Why are you putting your pants back on?
- |
  

- Are you restarting the striptease?
- |
