- "Angus: Well then, I see that everyone is here."

- Shall we get started?
- "Brian: Might we call the roll, at least for the sake of the minutes?"
- "Angus: Good point."
- |
  

- Malcolm?
- "Malcolm: Oh, right, right."
- |
  

- I'm secretary this fiscal year, aren't I? All right, then.

- Now, as I'm sure you know from reading the memo e-mailed last Tuesday, we're meeting to begin conceiving our next album.
- |
  

- Sales of our latest, Stiff Upper Lip, have tailed off, and tour revenue will only sustain the corporation through the end of fiscal 2002.
- |
  

- Our back catalog, interview discs, live collections, and the box set helped the bottom line, but these are signs of a brand treading water.
- |
  

- We need new product to assure continued growth through fiscal 2003.
- "Malcolm: All right, then."
- |
  

- Should we review and approve minutes from the last meeting or jump ahead to item no.

- "\"Brainstorming new song titles."
- "Angus: Let's not mess with Robert's Rules this once."
- |
  

- Has everyone had a chance to review the minutes?

- Any objections?
- "All: No."

- "Angus: Now remember, the only bad idea is one that isn't shared."
- |
  

- Remember Ballbreaker?
- |
  

- I wouldn't have believed we had never used that album title, but there it was 1995 and it was fresh as ever.
- |
  

- Or "You Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll"? That's a classic title, undiscovered until our last album.
- "Brian: That was a nice one, Phil."
- "Phil: Thanks."
- "Angus: All right."
- |
  

- Don't be shy; just throw them out there.
- "Brian: Well, I've been toying with something called \"Flirt in a Skirt."

- |
  

- That's a keeper.
- "Cliff: How about \"Snowball?"
- "Brian: That's a good one, but we already went in that direction with \"Snowballed\" from For Those About to Rock."
- "Cliff: I should have known it was too good to be true."
- "Brian: That's a good reminder to do our homework before we meet."
- "Angus: What do you guys think of \"Pole Position\"?"
- "Brian: That I can work with."
- "Angus: Malcolm, what are you giggling about?"
- |
  

- Do you want to share it with the group?
- "Malcolm: Yeah."
- |
  

- "\"Put Your Glove on My Love."
- "Phil: Boys, we might as well pack up and go home."
- |
  

- We're not going to do better than that.

- "Angus: Malcolm, this may be inappropriate, but I'm going to hug you."
- |
  

- Rustling sound on tape]
- "Angus (to Malcolm): I seem to have wrinkled your coat."
- |
  

- I'll pay for the dry cleaning.
- |
  

- To the group) OK, that one is going to get the juices flowing.
- |
  

- Does anybody &#151;
- "Phil: Angus, pardon the interruption, but what about that?"
- "Angus: Sorry, but you've lost me."
- |
  

- What do you &#151;
- "Brian: He's right."
- |
  

- "\"Got My Juices Flowing."
- "\" Is that what you were getting at, Phil?"
- "Phil: Exactly."
- "Angus: This is why I've come really to value these meetings?"
- |
  

- I was going to suggest, before being so productively interrupted, "Wired for Rock.
- "Cliff: Kudos, gentlemen."
- "Angus: OK, we're halfway there."
- "Brian: I notice we haven't dealt much with liquor yet."
- |
  

- I love the sex-based titles, but need I remind you all that AC/DC thrives on variety.
- |
  

- I keep coming back to the word "jigger.
- "\" Your thoughts?"
- "Malcolm: What about \"Two Jiggers of Love\"?"
- "Cliff: That just adds to the sex thing."
- "Angus: Right, right, but we could address that in the lyrics, juxtaposing images of alcohol with those of sex, a compare/contrast construct."
- "Brian: I think I can make that work."
- "Angus: Okay, moving along."
- |
  

- Brian, you're shared only one idea.
- "Brian: Well, I wanted to give the other guys a chance, to cultivate diversity of opinion."
- "Angus: Certainly, but we're on a schedule."
- "Brian: All right."

- |
  

- I move that we accept this slate of titles for our next album.
- "Brian: I second the motion."
- "Malcolm: All in favor?"
- "All: Aye."
- "Angus: Excellent work."
- |
  

- "A final reminder: we've scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 3 p.m."
- |
  

- If you'd like, we can also hold an informal session this evening at my house.
- "Brian: Sounds great."
- |
