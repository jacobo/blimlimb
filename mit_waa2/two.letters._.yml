- Dear Mr. Jackass (sir),

- You'd think I didn't know how to use a bookstore.
- What the hell?

- The spine was (and I might add, still is) ripped.

- Not a marring of unreconcilable stature, but enough to look "worn" next to my other copies of McSwys on the shelf. I love books and despite your stupidity in printing the damn things in Iceland (which I approve of (stupidity, not Iceland)), they are beautiful. I read my books in the safety of home and with clean hands and I never lend them, ever, even to friends (I have none).
- I'm pissed that my copy of 1999's 1st McSweeney's was for all intents and purposes (mine), ruined.

- Since my mail carrier works for the government I find no better recourse than to blame you, sir, for the piteous condition in which IT arrived.

- You spend the first 3 pages of this issue bragging about how much care goes into the printing and filling of subscriptions, boo hoo, etc.

- "\"white 9x12 envelopes."

- Here I was, reading along happily, a grin on my face for the first time in weeks, and thinking how quaint for this big-city-joe to personally inscribe each subscription (except mine.

  Dear McSweeney's,\n\
  The other day I was hoping to happen upon your popular virtual home\n\
  when, in place of the correct address, \"mcsweeneys.net,\" I inadvertently\n\
  typed into my browser the more hackneyed \"mcsweeneys.com.\" There I\n\
  discovered the internet's oldest and most respected source of\n\
  information about the McSweeney family of Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\
  It's a handsome site with lots of previously unknown information\n\
  about McSweeney patriarch Gerry, daughter Rebecca and some of the lesser\n\
  known McSweeneys as well. Having achieved a level of intimacy with the\n\
  family from reading their online biographies (\"Hi, my name is Trevor. I\n\
  am seven. I have lots of friends. I like to build forts. . .\"), I\n\
  proceeded to the link labeled \"Family and Friends Click Here,\" but was\n\
  unexpectedly foiled by the following prompt: \"Our current schedule is\n\
  available to family and close friends only. To prove your identity\n\
