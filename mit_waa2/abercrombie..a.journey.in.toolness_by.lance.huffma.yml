- I am only looking.
- |
  

- Why do I suddenly hear Jim Morrison howling between my ears?
- |
  

- I step over the threshold from a bright, white shopping mall into a cavern selling an aspirational lifestyle of toolness.
- |
  

- "\"This is the End."
- |
  

- My only friend, the end.
- "\" The pounding bass from electronic music ushers me into a store with the ambiance of a frat party and an opium den."
- "\"Bra."
- "\" A tall Aryan boy in unpleated khakis and a counterfeit Rugby shirt accosts me."
- |
  

- He initiates some kind of tribal hand shake.
- |
  

- His collar is popped and disjointed.
- |
  

- His hair is stylish chaos.
- |
  

- "\"Do you need help?"
- "\"I am just looking."
- "\" He knows I am lost."
- |
  

- He looks at me with suspicion.
- "\"I've seen ones like you."
- |
  

- You wander from machine to machine in Gold's Gym so unsure of yourself.
- |
  

- Yes, I've seen you.
- |
  

- What is it that you want?
- "\"I am just looking."
- "\"No, it's time for a change."
- |
  

- You won't tell me what you want because you don't know what you need.
- |
  

- You need this.
- "\"What is this?"
- "\"Our newest fragrance for bras and honeys."
- |
  

- We call it Lechery and Lechery is bi-curious.
- "\" The container is an iridescent molehill."
- |
  

- I shrink away but he laughs to ease me.
- |
  

- "\"Don't worry, bra!"
- |
  

- It's just a nipple.
- "\" He points the pink glass nipple in my face."
- "\"What is the scent?"
- "\" I hesitantly allow him to spritz the sketchy substance on my arm."
- "\"Sex."
- "\" I carefully inch my nose over my wrist."
- "\"That's what sex smells like?"
- "\" He looks at me as if I were not so worldly as he."
- "\"I forgot you would not know."
- "\" He stares into the darkest corner of his trendy apparel den."
- |
  

- "\"You probably think I am a poseur, but I know who you are ."
- |
  

- You're an errand boy with a laundry list of iniquity from capitalist robber barons.
- "\"I swear I am just looking."
- "\"No one looks here."
- |
  

- You taste!
- "\" He grabs my hand and forcibly rests it on a table of marked-down Rugby shirts."
- |
  

- "\"Taste."
- |
  

- Taste.
- |
  

- Do not be afraid.
- |
  

- I saw your Bermuda shorts and I knew, I knew you would come here to judge us.
- |
  

- Why don't you try on some cargo pants?
- |
  

- Distressed jeans?
- |
  

- You will know why I pop my collar and shun the light of the outside.
- "\"Distressed jeans?"
- |
  

- What have you done to them?
- "\" I cry in horror as I search for an exit in this dimly lit garment jungle."
- "\"HAHAHAHA, you're funny just like Leno!"
- |
  

- I watch Leno every night.
- |
  

- Pure comedic genius.
- |
  

- He may only say a Paris Hilton joke I've heard thousands of times before, but when Jay says it, I've heard humor for the first time .
- |
  

- Bra, I have some T-shirts you need to see.
- |
  

- I want you to buy a T-shirt because you won't just buy a T-shirt.
- |
  

- You will buy hot young ass.
- |
  

- Have you seen our catalog, bra?
- "\"The glossy soft porn?"
- "\"Bra, you still don't understand."
- |
  

- I want to show you the T-shirts.
- |
  

- Let me bring you inside the circle.
- |
  

- I can be your big brother.
- |
  

- I can show you how the people here live.
- |
  

- So simple, so animal, so right.
- |
  

- Nature compels them and they act.
- |
  

- I was once like you, but then I fought my way through the clearance racks with my machete and saw the naked majesty of this society.
- |
  

- I knew I could never return.
- |
  

- I left my family and my belongings.
- |
  

- I learned how to properly fold khakis.
- |
  

- This place is spiritual.
- |
  

- Have you heard of the Kama Sutra?
- |
  

- There is nothing dirty about this place.
- He showed me several shelves of ambiguously raunchy T-shirts concerning crabs and beavers.
- |
  

- "One was an aged ringer shirt promoting a fake breast-milk campaign: \"Teats for Tots."
- "\" The tool is locked in a gaze with me."
- |
  

- I see stars of expectation in his eyes.
- |
  

- I will not disappoint him.
- "\"You've got some nice double-entendres here."
- "\"Double-entendre?"
- "\" He looked intently into my eyes as if he had just rediscovered a prodigal brother."
- |
  

- "\"Bra, I like your mojo."
- |
  

- Go to the first dressing room and wait.
- |
  

- The girl from Successories is into it, too.
- "\"What?"
- "\" Perhaps he is not familiar with the term \""
- |
  

- "\" but I obey."
- |
  

- By now the spell is too great to break.
- |
  

- Out here, the authority of the tool is the voice of God and I hear his commandments well.
- "The last thing I remember: The demonic sound of techno music as a girl binds my wrists to a clothes rack."
- |
  

- "\"Don't worry,\""
- |
  

- "\"I used to work at Spencer's Gifts."
- "\" Jim Morrison's disorienting howls: \""
- Kill!
- |
  

- Kill!
- |
  

- Kill!
- |
  

- To my mother's chagrin, I like to tell this story at family cookouts.
- |
  

- Although, sometimes, when the reunion is awkwardly quiet because Uncle Pete is talking up Southern secession again, Mother will say to me, "Honey, tell that story.
- |
  

- The one about the gangbang in Abercrombie.
- "\" I smile and oblige."

  I am only looking. Why do I suddenly hear Jim Morrison howling between my ears?

The pounding bass from electronic music ushers me into a store with the ambiance of a frat party and an opium den.
  "Bra." A tall Aryan boy in unpleated khakis and a counterfeit Rugby shirt accosts me. He initiates some kind of tribal hand shake. His collar is popped and disjointed. His hair is stylish chaos. "Do you need help?"
