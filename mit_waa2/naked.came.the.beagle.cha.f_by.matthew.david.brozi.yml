- THE BIG GRIEF.

- I'd agreed to visit Mr. Brown at his place because Sally, my secretary, had asked me to especially nicely, wearing that dress I like, the persuasive periwinkle number that matches my lucky handkerchief and also goes well with her blond curls.
- |
  

- I'd only agreed to see Brown at all because I was in need of funds after the spinster Othmar had stiffed me.
- I could hear a dog yapping behind the door to Brown's apartment, growing only more animated when Brown opened the door and invited me in.
- "\"Cute puppy,\""
- |
  

- I remarked, referring to a young beagle, all nose and ears.
- |
  

- "\"What do you call him?"
- "\"I just got him."
- |
  

- I was thinking of calling him Ace .
- |
  

- Joe .
- |
  

- The dog yelped at each, dissatisfied.
- "\"How about Snippy?"
- "\"He's not used to people."
- |
  

- Come on .
- |
  

- Snippy,"
- |
  

- Brown said to the dog, trying it out.
- |
  

- "\"And please come in, Mr. Van Pelt."
- "\"After you, Mr. Brown."
- I followed, sizing up Brown.
- |
  

- If "snippy" described his dog, "shabby" described the owner.
- |
  

- Easy as his sister was on the eyes, he was something to avoid seeing in daylight.
- |
  

- It looked as if he'd never had hair, and this did nothing to lessen the immensity of his unnaturally round head.
- |
  

- His posture hinted at an insistence on playing contact sports despite no significant ability, or even balance.
- |
  

- He wore a pale-yellow shirt with a jagged stain on the front, near where his belt seemed ready to renege on what was being asked of it.
- "\"Thank you for your time,\""
- |
  

- "\"You'll be paying for my time, Charles, if I agree to take your case."
- "\" I told him my terms."
- |
  

- I asked if he still wanted to talk.
- "\"Money's not an issue,\""
- |
  

- I couldn't find a reason to believe him.
- |
  

- "\"My father\x97\""
- "\"Your father,\""
- |
  

- I said, "was a barber.
- "\"Yes,\""
- |
  

- "Charles confirmed, \"but he invested wisely,  and\x97\""
- "\"So you had some trouble with a woman,\""
- |
  

- I said, moving us along.
- |
  

- "\"What's her name?"
- "\"I ."
- |
  

- I never got it.
- "\"Describe her."
- "\"Petite, with ."
- |
  

- Waiting for him to finish, I lit a cigarette.
- "\"."
- |
  

- "\"And you got burned."
- |
  

- OK, I'll find your small, carrot-topped dame, Mr. Brown.
- "\" I stood, letting him know our interview was over."
- |
  

- He extended a hand toward me.
- |
  

- I shook it, briefly.
- "\"Thank you, Mr. Van Pelt,\""
- |
  

- "\"Sally says you're the best."
- |
  

- She talks about you all the time.
- |
  

- "She\x97\""
- She's a sweet kid," I allowed.
- "\"I'll have to buy her dinner tonight,\""
- |
  

- Charles said.
- "\"Take an umbrella,\""
- |
  

- I recommended.
- |
  

- "\"It's supposed to be dark and stormy."
- At that, Charles Brown's beagle bolted from the room.
- |
  

- As I made my own way out, Brown's canary chirped weakly.
- |
  

- I peered into its cage and saw dozens of uneaten treats.
- "\"He doesn't care for peanuts,\""
- |
  

- I observed.
- "\"Neither do I,\""
- |
  

- Brown confessed.
- |
  

- "\"But I do like Cracker Jack."
- "\"Looking for a big prize?"
- |
  

- I wouldn't,"
- |
  

- I volunteered, "but I would stock up on birdseed.
- |
  

- As a rule, if you're looking for a girl in this town, start at the Crab's Dungeon.
- I was swallowing a slug of hooch when the bartender said, "Go on back.
- |
  

- Miss Lucy will see you now.
- "\"Thanks, Franklin,\""
- |
  

- "I said, flipping him a token of my gratitude before venturing into a plush, velvet-lined office behind a door that read \"Private\"\x97and below that: \"The Madam Is IN."
- "\"I'm looking for a girl,\""
- |
  

- I said, dropping into a davenport.
- "\"Who isn't?"
- "\" she replied."
- "\"Client says the dame's small, with red hair."
- "\"Doesn't sound like anyone I know."
- |
  

- Or anyone I can remember seeing around.
- "\"How much?"
- "\"I'm not holding out on you, pipsqueak,\""
- |
  

- Miss Lucy said.
- |
  

- "\"It doesn't ring a bell."
- "\"All right, then."
- |
  

- Thanks anyway.
- |
  

- If you don't mind, I'll use the back door.
- "\"Oh, brother,\""
- |
  

- "\"If I had a nickel ."
- |
  

- Breaking into Brown's apartment was almost too easy.
- |
  

- "Once I'd taken a look around, I saw that my client would have more to replace than just a lock\x97his bird was dead."
- |
  

- It was only a bird, but I was uncomfortable with how .
- |
  

- I was draping my handkerchief over the body of Charles Brown's canary when everything went dark.
- |
  

- I came around to find myself bound to a chair with kite string, a kite still attached to one end.
- |
  

- The kite had seen better days.
- |
  

- So had I.
- "\"It's all we could find,\""
- |
  

- "\"Who are you?"
- "\" Not my smoothest repartee, but the best I could muster under the circumstances."
- "\"Miss Patricia Reichardt,\""
- |
  

- "\"And my associate, Marcie,\""
- |
  

- The one doing the talking was tomboyish, with freckles, while her quiet companion was bespectacled and mousy.
- "\"Ladies,\""
- |
  

- I said, bowing my head.
- |
  

- Slowly.
- |
  

- It still throbbed.
- "\"Very good, Chuck."
- |
  

- Marcie, find me a corkscrew.
- "\"Yes, sir."
- "\"Wait,\""
- |
  

- I said, but not because I was afraid.
- |
  

- I was curious why they were in Charles Brown's apartment, and it was only starting to dawn on me that they were laboring under a misconception.
- |
  

- Chuck?
- |
  

- I'd thought she'd been calling me Dick.
- "\"You're looking for Charles Brown?"
- "\" I asked."
- "\"Not anymore,\""
- |
  

- Patricia said.
- |
  

- "\"Now we're going to turn Charles black and blue."
- "\"Good one, sir,\""
- |
  

- Marcie chimed in.
- "\"I'm not him."
- "\"Aren't you?"
- "\"You couldn't pay me enough to pretend,\""
- |
  

- I told them.
- |
  

- "\"I'm a P.I."
- |
  

- Brown.
- |
  

- I suspected he wasn't being straight with me, so I came here to poke around while I knew he'd be away.
- |
  

- I thought he'd mentioned he'd be out tonight only casually.
- |
  

- Now I know he wanted me here .
- |
  

- I also have a feeling he's not planning to come back.
- |
  

- Ever.
- The women took a moment to consider this.
- |
  

- Finally, the larger woman nodded to the smaller, and Marcie untied me.
- "\"Maybe we need a formal introduction after all, shamus,\""
- |
  

- Patricia said.
- "\"My name's Van Pelt,\""
- |
  

- I said, standing, shaking off the kite string and turning to the kitchen cabinets in search of something restorative to drink.
- |
  

- "\"Linus Van Pelt."
- |
  

- Now, I've told you why I'm looking for Brown.
- |
  

- What's your beef, Patty?
- "\"I'm an adjuster with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company."
- "\"I take it Brown has a policy,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"A big one."
- |
  

- And he made a claim on it just this morning.
