- Chris Therien, former Philadelphia Flyer defenseman and on-ice liability, stood outside a small English farmhouse as the first strong winds of a storm blew through the night sky.
- |
  

- As lightning began to crack and thunder rumbled nearby, he knocked on the door.
- |
  

- The Philadelphia Flyers had lent him their time machine so he could take on odd jobs.
- |
  

- Therien had recently branched out to baby-sitting, having tired of raking leaves.
- The door of the farmhouse let out a long, groaning creak as it was opened, and there stood a small girl.
- |
  

- A small girl who shrieked at the sight of 6-foot-5-inch Therien, as soon as she realized that the darkness that encompassed the entire doorway was a person.
- "\"Mary Shelby?"
- "\" Therien asked, which caused the little girl to stop screaming and stare blankly up at him."
- |
  

- Therien looked at the words scratched into his palm by a ballpoint pen.
- |
  

- "\"I'm sorry\x97Shelley."
- The little girl's fingers curled up as she began to scream again.
- "\"What's the matter?"
- "\" Therien asked, lurching into the Shelley house."
- |
  

- His shoulders bashed against the doorjamb, causing the building to shudder.
- |
  

- Therien, with the flexibility of a hard pretzel, raised his arm to little Mary Shelley and patted her head gently, which nearly knocked her out.
- |
  

- "\"I brought Jenga."
- Mary turned and scampered up the stairs on her hands and feet.
- "\"OK, you hide, I'll seek,\""
- |
  

- Therien said as he began to wander up the stairs, each step cracking the plaster walls of the tiny house and making the foundation groan.
- "\"Are you in ."
- |
  

- "\" Therien asked as he accidentally shoved his hand through the door to Mary's parents' bedroom."
- |
  

- They had gone out for the night to do whatever 19th-century people did, which probably involved being amazed by gunpowder or participating in a stoning.
- |
  

- It was Mary Shelley's father, a heavy drinker, who had hired Chris Therien.
- Therien peeked into Mary's bedroom, which was simply appointed with a dresser and a small bed.
- |
  

- Propped up against the pillow was a small blond porcelain doll that strongly resembled little Mary Shelley.
- |
  

- Enchanted, Chris Therien picked it up.
- "\"Pretty,\""
- |
  

- He turned to see a silent Mary Shelley standing in the doorway.
- |
  

- Stunned, she turned and ran.
- |
  

- Chris Therien followed and found her curled up in the family's bathtub.
- "\"Is it bath time?"
- "\" Therien asked, unsure if he should charge more for bathing children."
- Mary screeched, the sonic power of the sound cracking the thin panes of glass in the bathroom.
- "\"How about we have some popcorn and watch  The Goonies ?"
- "\" Therien asked, completely unaware that the early 19th century had neither microwave ovens nor DVD players."
- Mary, finding courage, shook her head petulantly.
- "\"No, huh?"
- |
  

- "Oh, I forgot to tell you\x97I brought a friend,\""
- |
  

- Therien said, with an exaggerated wink.
- Little Mary Shelley's eyes widened in terror.
- "\"The TICKLE MONSTER!"
- "\" Therien yelled, reaching toward the suddenly pale child, who ducked his advance and ran through his legs."
- |
  

- Therien's problem was that he attempted to look through his legs, something he hadn't been able to do since third grade.
- |
  

- Third grade was also the last time he did a somersault, which was what he did now, into the bathtub, crushing it just as he'd crushed the doll head.
- "\"Arrr-irrr!"
- "\" roared Therien as he struggled to get to his feet and, with both arms stuck straight out, roamed mindlessly through the small bathroom, knocking down tinctures, balms, liniments, and salves."
- |
  

- Which was quite reminiscent of his performance in the 2002 National Hockey League playoffs.
- "\"Stop it!"
- "\" yelled Mary Shelley from the safety of the hallway."
- "\"Arrr-irrr!"
- "\" continued Therien as he jumped up awkwardly, slammed his head into the doorjamb, and pinballed back toward the breakable parts of the bathroom."
- |
  

- Slipping on an ointment, he collapsed on the floor, howling.
- "\"What's wrong?"
- "\" Mary Shelley asked carefully."
- Chris Therien held up his massive hand and, tears welling in his dull, lifeless eyes, pointed to a small sliver of porcelain embedded in his palm.
- "\"It's just a splinter,\""
- |
  

- Mary said.
- |
  

- "\"I can get it out."
- And with her tiny English girl hands, she quite easily got the splinter out of the behemoth's hand.
- |
  

- She watched one final tear of gratitude roll down his face.
- "\"Mmmmm."
- "\" Therien made a yummy noise as he stroked Mary's face heavily with his hand."
- |
  

- She sat down on the floor next to him and patted his back.
- "\"You know, I've never baby-sat before,\""
- |
  

- Therien confessed as he absent-mindedly licked his hand.
- "\"Really?"
- "\" Mary asked politely, picking up her parents' shattered toiletries."
- "\"You know what people have always told me?"
- |
  

- That I'm a trier, not a doer,"
- |
  

- Therien.
- |
  

- "\"That and 'Next time remember your skates."
- |
  

- "\"You haven't been the worst baby-sitter I've ever had,\""
- |
  

- Mary said, trying to cheer up the man who for many years was usually directly responsible for most of the goals scored against the Flyers.
- "\"I know what'll make us feel better\x97let's make s'mores!"
- "\" he exclaimed."
- Buoyed by Mary Shelley's praise, he rocketed to his feet, slamming his head into an oil-filled lantern hanging from the wall and knocking its fiery contents to the floor.
- "\"Quick, get the sand bucket,\""
- |
  

- Mary yelled as the flames spread rapidly.
- "\"No, fire hates water."
- |
  

- I know exactly what to do,"
- |
  

- Therien countered.
- |
  

- He grabbed Mary's hand and pulled her out of the bathroom.
- Minutes later, Mary watched as her family's home, defying the first drops of a rainstorm, burned to the ground while Therien tried to call 911, not cognizant of the fact that the nearest cellular tower was a couple hundred years away.
- "\"It's still ringing,\""
- |
  

- Mary's neighbors, intrigued by the flames shooting hundreds of feet in the air, ran up carrying torches and pitchforks, as they were wont to do.
- "\"What 'appened 'ere?"
- "\" demanded a man with a charming cockney accent and a jaunty cap."
- "\"Fire,\""
- |
  

- Therien said as one lone tear ran down the front of his monstrously blocky head.
- |
  

- "\"Bad."
