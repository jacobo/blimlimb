- Good afternoon, sir.
- |
  

- No, I'm not looking for anything in particular, just admiring your fine array of  Scarface  apparel.
- |
  

- You know, until I was walking up here, I had no idea  Scarface  had become so popular again.

- "Shirts, wristbands, hats, boxers\x97this is just incredible."
- |
  

- It's almost as if Tony Montana were being deified.
- |
  

- I think that  Scarface  could possibly be the next new fad religion .
- |
  

- Oh, no, sir, actually it's entirely possible for this to be a religion; you just have to look at things objectively here.
- |
  

- Objectivity can make anything possible.
- |
  

- OK, hear me out, and I was totally just thinking about this yesterday .
- |
  

- All right .
- |
  

- "Ultimate Reality\x97Ultimate Reality being the absolute nature of all things."
- By that cross around your neck large enough to hold the actual Christ on it, I can see that Christianity is the absolute nature of all things to you.

- You devote yourself weekly to church and worship something you believe is the most important thing in your life, right?
- |
  

- Something that you believe is bigger than you, your wife, and your job.
- |
  

- What makes that any different from, say, I don't know, football?
- |
  

- Don't act like you don't know people who would step over the dead raped carcass of their spouse to watch particular sports .
- |
  

- Anyway .
- |
  

- Please don't get angry, sir.
- |
  

- I'm not trying to insult your religious practices by making unpleasant comparisons; I'm just being objective for the sake of proving my point that  Scarface  can be the next fad religion.

- People devotionally watch  Scarface ; they don apparel so the public knows they are fans.

- They consistently try to emulate its lead character.

- How is that any different from the basic structure of any other religion?
- |
  

- Do you see what I'm saying?

- Stop being angry!

Oh, no, sir, actually it's entirely possible for this to be a religion; you just have to look at things objectively here. Objectivity can make anything possible. OK, hear me out, and I was totally just thinking about this yesterday ... All right ... so take all religions and define them as someone's Ultimate Reality\x97Ultimate Reality being the absolute nature of all things.\n\
