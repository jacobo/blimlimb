- Seven soldiers sit along the muddy trench walls of Ypres, staring at a man standing before them.
- |
  

- The muffled snaps of gunfire and the occasional whoomps of artillery are going off in the background.
- "\"Why should you climb over that wall and charge the Germans?"
- "\" asked Keith Primeau, undeniable force and captain of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League."
- |
  

- "\"I'll tell you why, and listen up, because I'm about to land some knowledge on you."
- |
  

- Ready?
- |
  

- OK, here it is.
- |
  

- Guts beat skill, every single time.
- "\"Sure, the Germans have rifles, machine guns, and, apparently, airplanes dropping poisonous gas."
- |
  

- But you have guts.
- |
  

- Sure, they might shoot better than you, they might be more skilled in the operation of their weapons.
- |
  

- But you have guts.
- |
  

- "Believe me when I tell you this: Those Germans would give up all their tanks and zeppelins if they could have your guts."
- |
  

- They'd make the trade in a second.
- |
  

- And it would be a terrible trade.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- That's right.
- |
  

- Guts beat skill, every single time.
- "\"Bathscombe, I don't want to single you out, but stand up for a second."
- |
  

- Yeah, not all the way up, you don't want the Germans to shoot you in the head.
- |
  

- Bathscombe, I'm sure this will not come as a surprise to you, but you look terrible.
- |
  

- Your skin is yellow, your eyes are yellow, and you've got that big blue bruise on your neck.
- |
  

- Nobody trusts you, but I trust you.
- |
  

- That's right, because right in there you have guts.
- |
  

- No, lower than that, Bathscombe.
- |
  

- Yes, right there, you are full of guts.
- "\"Let me tell you a story about my little Finnish friend, Sami Kapanen."
- |
  

- Two years ago, in the playoffs, Sami gets a flying elbow to the head from Darcy Tucker of the Maple Leafs.
- |
  

- Darcy Tucker is such a bastard that he should be over there with the Germans.
- |
  

- I know I shouldn't say that, but I can't help myself.
- |
  

- Anyway, Sami gets his skull dented and he is out there flat on the ice and he doesn't know his name, doesn't know where he is, doesn't know the Finnish language.
- |
  

- All he remembers is one thing, that he is a Philadelphia Flyer.
- |
  

- Wait a sec, I'm getting a little teary here.
- |
  

- OK, so, little Sami gets up, struggles to his feet, and he skates.
- |
  

- I mean, all he can see is black, all he can smell is burning butter, and he is skating.
- |
  

- Meanwhile, we win the game and kick the Leafs out of the playoffs.
- |
  

- But the most important thing is that Sami is skating, maybe not in the right direction, maybe while throwing up, but he was still skating.
- |
  

- Because Sami has guts.
- "\"Bathscombe, I'm telling you, I see a little of Sami in you."
- |
  

- I see a little Sami Kapanen in every one of you here.
- |
  

- You guys are not the type to just sit here in a trench for four years; you are the type of guys who stand up, wipe some of that mud off your butts, and get those Germans out of Belgium.
- |
  

- Are you with me?
- "\"All right, BEF on three."
- |
  

- One .
- |
  

- Two .
- |
  

- Three .
- |
  

- British Expeditionary Force!
- |
  

- Go get 'em, boys.
- |
  

- Show those Germans what guts are all about.
- |
  

- Two minutes pass.
- |
  

- "\"OK, the four of you have nothing to be ashamed of, nothing at all."
- "\"Hey, don't be sorry about Bathscombe."
- |
  

- He's not sorry, believe me.
- |
  

- He went out doing what he wanted to do.
- |
  

- I realize he didn't make it to the German line, but that's not what guts are about.
- |
  

- I might not be popular for saying that, but they're not.
- "\"I still contend that guts beat skill, every single time."
- |
  

- Maybe it would make it clearer if I added 'in the long run.
- |
  

- "\"Let me tell you a little bit about myself."
- |
  

- I can barely skate, and yet I am the captain of the greatest hockey team in the NHL.
- |
  

- I'm not kidding.
- |
  

- Physically, it is nearly impossible for me to skate.
- |
  

- I'm top-heavy, I've got skinny legs, my equilibrium is like a snow globe, and my ankles are like glass swans.
- |
  

- And yet I do skate.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Because guts are better than miracles.
- "\"Believe me, guys, I am just like you."
- |
  

- Sometimes I wake up and I hear that little voice inside me.
- |
  

- The little voice that says you can't put that puck in the net or you have the motor skills of a dead cricket or maybe you shouldn't rub your gloves in other men's faces.
- |
  

- And do you know what I do?
- |
  

- I ball up that little voice and I swallow it.
- |
  

- It might not be healthy, but health has nothing to do with guts.
- "\"You know what I'm trying to say?"
- |
  

- That's right, Chesterton, health has nothing to do with Germans, either.
- |
  

- Believe me, they are over there in their trenches and they are shaken.
- |
  

- They were completely unprepared for you to run across that field.
- |
  

- I mean unprepared mentally, Montgomery.
- |
  

- And you know what they're not expecting?
- |
  

- For you to do it again.
- "\"I'm not kidding."
- |
  

- They are over there with their teeth chattering.
- |
  

- They are seriously unsettled.
- |
  

- Your guts are that much superior to their skill.
- |
  

- That's not even a question.
- "\"Chesterton, you're ready to run across that field again?"
- |
  

- See that?
- |
  

- That's guts.
- |
  

- Who wants to charge with Chesterton?
- |
  

- Terrific.
- |
  

- I'll tell you what, guys.
- |
  

- By doing this, by running across that field, you've already beaten those Germans.
- |
  

- You've already won.
- "\"OK, on three, and don't forget to zigzag this time."
- |
  

- One .
- |
  

- Two .
- |
  

- Three .
- |
  

- British Expeditionary Force!
- |
  

- Two more minutes pass.
- |
  

- "\"OK, Willington, hold your chin up."
- |
  

- "Let me tell you this: There are many kinds of victories."
- |
  

- Today was just one of those different kinds of victories.
