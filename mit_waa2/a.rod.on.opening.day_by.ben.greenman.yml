- "HER: Do you mind if we start with a little backrub?"
- "HIM: No."
- "HER: You're so muscular."
- "HIM: Well, I work out all the time."
- "HER: You're very tense, too."
- |
  

- Do you want to take your shirt off?
- "HIM: It's not a shirt."
- |
  

- It's a uniform.
- |
  

- My Yankees uniform, to be exact.
- "HER: I didn't realize that you wear number 13."
- |
  

- Aren't you worried that it's unlucky?
- "HIM: I'm not superstitious."
- "HER: Not even this year?"
- "HIM: What?"
- "HER: Nothing."
- |
  

- Hold on.
- |
  

- I feel a knot here.
- |
  

- Let me work it a little.
- "HIM: ( Groaning."
- |
  

- That feels good.
- |
  

- Cynthia never would do that for me.
- |
  

- And certainly she wouldn't do it while she was dressed up like you are.
- "HER: I thought it was a little weird when you mentioned it, but it's your money."
- |
  

- Most guys have us dress up like schoolgirls.
- |
  

- Maybe a pirate.
- |
  

- But not like .
- |
  

- Who am I dressed up as, again?
- "HIM: Esteban Loaiza."
- "HER: Right."
- |
  

- Who is that?
- "HIM: He's a pitcher."
- |
  

- In 23 at-bats against him, I have 12 hits and 5 homers.
- "HER: Is that good?"
- "HIM: That's an OPS of more than 1.8."
- "HER: Is that good?"
- "HIM: It's so good."
- |
  

- Moans.
- |
  

- "HER: Honestly, I think it's probably better if we get you out of that uniform."
- "HIM: No!"
- "HER: You don't want to get it all messy, do you?"
- "HIM: OK, OK."
- |
  

- You can take off the pants, but not the shirt.
- "HER: Let's start with you on your stomach."
- "HIM: Are you going to give me a shot?"
- "HER: What?"
- "HIM: Sorry."
- |
  

- Force of habit.
- "HER: I'm just finishing up the massage."
- |
  

- Now I need you to roll back over onto your stomach.
- "HIM: Careful of my hip."
- "HER: OK."
- |
  

- We're all set.
- |
  

- Now you just lay back and let me do the work.
- "HIM: I hope I still have time to catch up to some of the other guys and be in MVP contention."
- |
  

- My contract bumps up if I do.
- "HER: I think your contract just bumped up right here."
- "HIM: It's exciting to think about another big season."
- "HER: The season isn't the only thing that's big."
- |
  

- Listen, can I ask you something?
- "HIM: You came to the right place."
- "HER: Well, I had a guy in here last week who said that you're not the best player."
- "HIM: Is he including pitchers?"
- "HER: Oh."
- |
  

- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- I see that this is going to interfere with our afternoon.
- "HIM: ( Sitting up on elbow."
- |
  

- It's just that, if he's talking about pitchers, that's not fair.
- |
  

- You can't compare pitchers in a rotation with everyday players.
- "HER: No. He was talking about a hitter."
- "HIM: It's not Pujols, is it?"
- "HER: Let's not talk about it."
- |
  

- It's getting in the way.
- |
  

- We have work to do.
- "HIM: Was it Pujols?"
- |
  

- Just tell me.
- |
  

- I can take it.
- "HER: No."
- "HIM: Manny?"
- |
  

- "I can't believe how lucky Torre got: first me, then him."
- |
  

- An ape could be a good manager with talent like that.
- |
  

- But, after this season Manny had, I'm worried that Boras is starting to care about him more.
- |
  

- I can't believe no one's looking into Manny's medicine cabinet.
- "HER: I think you just lost the last of your interest."
- "HIM: In Boras?"
- |
  

- No way!
- |
  

- He's been good to me.
- "HER: Not in Boras, whoever that is."
- |
  

- In me.
- |
  

- You choked up on your bat, if you know what I mean.
- "HIM: Just tell me it was some guy with a Japanese name."
- |
  

- Sadaharu Oh?
- "HER: No. Suzuki someone?"
- "HIM: Ichiro?"
- "HER: Yeah."
- |
  

- That was it.
- |
  

- Hey, your back just relaxed.
- "HIM: If that guy thought Ichiro was better than me, he didn't know what he was talking about."
- |
  

- He hits for average, sure, but he has no power, and he never walks.
- |
  

- He's a slap hitter.
- "HER: Sounds fun."
- "HIM: Ask any stats guy who knows what he's talking about."
- |
  

- It's only the old geezers who talk about playing the game the way it used to be played.
- |
  

- In his most efficient season, Mickey Mantle was nowhere near me.
- "HER: I believe you."
- |
  

- But you're starting to get tense again
- "HIM: Will you tell me some things?"
- "HER: Sure, but I wasn't planning on talking."
- "HIM: I need you to say that I went three for four with a home run."
- "HER: ( Sighing."
- |
  

- You went three for four with a home run.
- "HIM: No. Say it in an announcer's voice."
- |
  

- "\"Alex Rodriguez's hip appears to be healed."
- |
  

- The Yankees slugger went three for four with a home run.
- "HER: \"Alex Rodriguez's hip appears to be healed."
- |
  

- The Yankees slugger went three for four with a home run.
- "HIM: Yeah."
- |
  

- Better.
- "HER: I can see."
- |
  

- Now there's a bat for me to handle.
- "HIM: Say, \"It's a strong start to a season that is sure to erase any suspicions about the Yankees' most prolific hitter."
- "HER: It's hard for me to remember all that."
- |
  

- "Can't I go back to being Pi\xF1eiro?"
- "HIM: Who?"
- "HER: That pitcher I was pretending to be."
- "HIM: It was Loaiza, not Pi\xF1eiro!"
- |
  

- "Against Pi\xF1eiro, I'm only 4 for 27 with 1 homer."
- "HER: That thing just happened again."
- "HIM: What thing?"
- |
  

- The thing where you sabotaged me by mentioning one of the three active pitchers who have held my OPS under .
- |
  

- "HER: You're shouting."
- "HIM: Why not just dress up like Kevin Appier or call me Cody Ransom?"
- |
  

- You're as bad as Cynthia.
- |
  

- Can you pass me my pants?
- |
  

- I think I'm going to go.
