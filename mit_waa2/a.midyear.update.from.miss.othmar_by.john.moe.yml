- Hello, Parents!
- I've had the best time getting to know Charlie, Lucy, Schroeder, and all of your wonderful children.
- |
  

- Since we're now halfway through the school year, I thought it would be a good idea to drop a line and let everyone know how things are going.
- |
  

- Since I've never met any of you moms and dads and no one came to the last scheduled parent-teacher conferences, I can only hope that this letter somehow reaches you.
- |
  

- I must admit that I find it strange how the students almost never mention having parents, but I also realize that everyone's lives are pretty hectic these days and I don't like to pry.
- I would like to reiterate how grateful I am to the school for giving me a chance to teach this year.
- |
  

- Due to my specific condition, it was virtually impossible to land a job in education.
- |
  

- Many principals called me in for interviews based on my master's degree in primary education and willingness to work at a remarkably low salary level.
- |
  

- When they actually met me, however, things quickly deteriorated.
- |
  

- They insisted that a teacher should be able to communicate verbally, which, because of my profound speech impediment, I was unable to do in a traditional manner.
- |
  

- I tried frantically to explain that I really could be understood and that it would just require more careful listening.
- |
  

- Well, raising my voice, which to those employers just sounded like a screeching sort of squawk or an angry bird of prey, only made things worse.
- |
  

- By the time I had retrieved my steno pad to write out my thoughts, I was already being shown the door.
- I was grateful to the point of tears when this school finally hired me.
- |
  

- Granted, they did so without an interview, and that aided my cause considerably.
- |
  

- And I have found it odd that halfway through the year I still haven't met the principal or any other teachers.
- |
  

- But again, my job is to teach, not to go nosing around.
- My joy about being employed is nothing, however, compared to how happy I am to work with your precious children.
- |
  

- For the first time in my life, I am being understood!
- |
  

- Verbally!
- |
  

- Perhaps it took the open, nonjudgmental mind of a child to really listen, because now when I'm giving out homework or teaching a lesson, the kids pick up on every word.
- |
  

- Where others have heard simply "Wa-WA-wa-wa," your kids know that I'm really saying, "Please complete problems one through sixteen for tomorrow.
- "\" Truly, the kids and I have formed a special bond this year."
- |
  

- Several of them have said that I'm the only adult they know.
- |
  

- I can't imagine they mean it literally (though it almost sounds like they do) but it's a nice sentiment all the same.
- As I've said already, I don't mean to poke my nose in where it doesn't belong, but now that I've been teaching here for a few months and have established myself, I think, as a qualified teacher, I do have some nagging questions about the kids.
- |
  

- If you'd rather not tell me, that's fine, but I thought I would just put them out there.
- Are they all dwarfs?
- |
  

- I can't help but notice that all the students have abnormally short arms and legs as well as larger heads.
- |
  

- I realize that all kids are small, of course, but I really think there's something else going on here.
- |
  

- The heads, in particular, are quite sizable, to the point where I almost suspect cases of hydrocephalus in some of the children.
- |
  

- Given that dwarfism occurs in only 1 out of every 15,000 births, it seems improbable that there's an entire community affected by it, but that seems like the only possible answer.
- |
  

- Were there environmental factors in the town causing this mutation?
- |
  

- Has it been reported?
- Second, how did the children come to be so advanced?
- |
  

- Traditionally, kids at this age are almost entirely id-driven.
- |
  

- They seek only to satisfy their immediate needs&#8212;food, physical activity, toileting&#8212;and that's it.
- |
  

- But these kids of yours are sort of amazing.
- |
  

- In fact, the way they relate to their world is much more similar to how adults live.
- |
  

- Regular kids get mad and throw tantrums; one of my students seems to suffer from deep (and I believe untreated) clinical depression.
- |
  

- Regular kids are learning the basics of music; one of my students is not only enormously talented, but even seemingly burdened by his own genius.
- |
  

- Regular kids play occasional practical jokes; one of my students practices a consistent, calculated cruelty on one specific classmate (a football is involved) that borders on the sociopathic.
- |
  

- Regular kids have a bit of a learning curve when it comes to hygiene; one of my students is literally caked in filth.
- |
  

- I have tried to contact this student's parents since his condition does affect others, but I haven't been able to deduce a last name.
- |
  

- "\"Penn\""
- |
  

- And are their clothes washed every night?
- |
  

- Or does each child have several sets of the exact same outfit?
- |
  

- If so, why?
- |
  

- Why?
- In short, what's going on around here?
- |
  

- I mean, seriously.
- |
  

- If I knew, I really think I would be better able to address the highly specialized needs of my class.
- |
  

- A teacher needs to be part of the community they teach in.
- |
  

- I want to be a part of this one, but I really need more information.
- Finally, in classroom activities, Valentine's Day is fast approaching.
- |
  

- Please instruct your kids to purchase or make valentines for each one of their classmates.
- |
  

- I'm sure the day will go well.
- |
  

- I'm going to make another attempt to schedule parent-teacher conferences.
- |
  

- Please consider attending.
- Thanks.
