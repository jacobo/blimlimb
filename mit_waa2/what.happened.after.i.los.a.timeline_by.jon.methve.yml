I holler at the Filipinos to pay attention and guard me. I call Sopsop & Sopsop's complaint desk and am placed on hold for 40 minutes before a real voice answers.

- |
  

- When I complain, they tell me they're invisible.
- |
  

- This is part of their guardian-angel duties, they say.
- |
  

- "\"Pretend we are invisible,\""
- |
  

- "\"Pretend we are not in the room,\""
- |
  

- I pleasure Lindsay.

- God regarding poor guardian-angelship coverage.
- March 3
- The Sopsop brothers invite Lindsay to dinner.
- |
  

- Because I am a client on probation, they inform me it is against protocol to dine with them.
- |
  

- I have an egg roll and watch  Letterman  with six Filipinos.
- |

- |
  

- Also, they have no green cards.
- April 4
- Mr. Sopsop, CEO of Sopsop & Sopsop, bails me out.

- As soon as I can get her alone.
- June 12
- I'm fired from my administrative-assistant job for alleged sexual discrimination against Lindsay.
- |
  

- I am then deported from the Philippines and ordered never to return.
- July 18
- I begin to drive across America to find myself.
- July 22

- July 25
- "Because of the 16 stab wounds in my neck\x97not to mention the countless injuries and meaningless deaths and destructive hurricanes and mangling car wrecks and terrifying bear attacks and other miscellaneous violence caused by Heaven's perpetual disorganization and inefficiency\x97I bring a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the people of Earth against Heaven and the institution of guardian angelship."
