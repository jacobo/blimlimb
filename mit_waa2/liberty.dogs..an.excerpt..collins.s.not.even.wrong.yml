- |
  

- Billy, hey!
- |
  

- Billy-billy-billy!
- |
  

- Guys,&#8221; McGovern nods to them.
- When we get out to the prison yard out back, a few inmates are languidly bouncing a basketball back and forth, enjoying the first good weather in days.
- |
  

- Hey,&#8221; McGovern greets them, and shields his eyes against the sun.
- |
  

- Planning your escape?
- |
  

- Naw.
- |
  

- They laugh bashfully, and tousle the dog.
- |
  

- Man&#8217;s fooling with us.
- |
  

- Fooling.
- |
  

- And McGovern is at ease around them.
- |
  

- He&#8217;s here off the clock today; two guards are already at their post in the hub of the wheel-spoke prison, a Plexiglassed office that looks down the two cellblock wings and out into the cafeteria.
- |
  

- Sgt.
- |
  

- McGovern pauses to scratch Billy&#8217;s head as we walk away, and he quietly nods over at the guard station.
- |
  

- That&#8217;s what I did for years before getting this dog program.
- |
  

- Just sitting there, all day, like a scarecrow.
- |
  

- "I watch them: they watch me back."
- |
  

- The clock inside their station crawls slowly.
- |
  

- Sgt.
- |
  

- McGovern is on his third decade of forty-plus-hour weeks as a corrections officer.
- |
  

- It occurs to me that he has now spent more time in this prison than most of his inmates.
- |
  

- We crunch over the gravel parking lot in front of the path that winds down from the prison.
- |
  

- There are no guard towers, not even any fences.
- |
  

- Out by the road, though, is a much older house&#8212;a farmhouse, by the look of it.
- |
  

- Wedged as it is between the prison building and County Line Road, it&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone wanting to live there, never mind any realtor being able to sell it.
- |
  

- And yet I see hanging out of one of its windows a guy repainting an old window frame while Foghat hammers away from a little transistor radio.
- |
  

- That&#8217;s Independence House,&#8221; Sgt.
- |
  

- McGovern follows my gaze.
- |
  

- Seven inmates living there.
- |
  

- It&#8217;s a privilege earned for good behavior.
- |
  

- "My eyebrows go up: It&#8217;s a house."
- |
  

- They could just walk away, saunter down the road.
- |
  

- They don&#8217;t try leaving,&#8221; he interrupts my thought.
- |
  

- Here&#8217;s the thing.
- |
  

- The guys we put in there are lifers, guys on 20-year terms.
- |
  

- My confusion is obvious to him now.
- |
  

- You&#8217;re thinking they&#8217;d run, right?
- |
  

- No. Lifers know&#8212;they get caught, they go to max.
- |
  

- They&#8217;re motivated by that.
- |
  

- Lifers are the reliable ones.
- |
  

- He gestures around.
- |
  

- There&#8217;s no fences here.
- |
  

- This prison was built 20 years ago for 60 prisoners.
- |
  

- It&#8217;s got 120 now.
- |
  

- Know how many guards?
- |
  

- Twelve, total.
- |
  

- Two in there at any one time.
- |
  

- Two guards, 120 prisoners.
- |
  

- And we don&#8217;t have problems, really.
- |
  

- Not many incidents.
- |
  

- If they screw up here .
- |
  

- And they don&#8217;t want that.
- |
  

- So they stay.
- |
  

- The only fences they need here are for the dogs.
- |
  

- I guess it&#8217;s a prison of the mind,&#8221; he muses.
- |
  

- LIBERTY DOG PROGRAM,&#8221; the mural announces from the side of the cinderblock building.
- The Liberty Dog Program started years ago, and it has nearly died every one of those years.
- |
  

- Politicians don&#8217;t like it much, because nobody likes prisoners very much&#8212;not even prisoners who train dogs for the disabled.
- |
  

- Everybody loves to be Tough On Crime; it&#8217;s much tougher to know what to  do  with your criminals.
- |
  

- No one wins votes for thinking hard about that.
- |
  

- And yet the idea seems like a wonderfully obvious one.
- |
  

- We need prisons; we need guide dogs.
- |
  

- It takes time and an exercise yard to train guide dogs, and prisoners have nothing but time and an exercise yard.
- |
  

- We&#8217;ve got 12 dogs out back.
- |
  

- And inside here we&#8217;re putting in a little living room, just like home,&#8221; Sgt.
- |
  

- McGovern says as he takes me indoors.
- |
  

- He gestures at an empty expanse of concrete floor.
- |
  

- It&#8217;ll have a rug, chairs, sofa, lamps&#8212;just all the stuff you&#8217;d have in a living room.
- |
  

- That way both the dogs and disabled people we&#8217;re matching them with can train in a realistic setting.
- |
  

- Billy trots around on the concrete as if to emphasize the point.
- |
  

- Watch this,&#8221; McGovern says.
- |
  

- Billy?
- |
  

- Billy!
- |
  

- Get me a beer.
- |
  

- Billy bounds to an old refrigerator pushed over into a corner.
- |
  

- The fridge has a thick nautical rope tied around its handle, and Billy takes the rope in his mouth and yanks the door open.
- |
  

- Then he reaches in, tilts his jaws around a beer can, and delivers it into McGovern&#8217;s hands.
- |
  

- Check out the brand,&#8221; the sergeant says, and I look at the practice can.
- |
  

- "It&#8217;s gone through a lot, and has plenty of scratches and dents from canine teeth, but I can clearly make out its ancient label: Billy Beer."
- |
  

- What do you train for with autism?
- |
  

- Danger.
- |
  

- Spotting danger.
- |
  

- That&#8217;s the first thing.
- |
  

- Autistic kids might try running into a pool of water, or into the street&#8212;you know, they see something and they&#8217;re interested in it, they focus on it, and they don&#8217;t notice anything else.
- |
  

- The parents worry about that.
- |
  

- So basically the dogs help shepherd them.
- |
  

- And also, the dog&#8217;s a connection to other people.
- |
  

- It&#8217;s their interpreter.
- |
  

- If autistics are the ultimate introverts, dogs are the ultimate extroverts.
- |
  

- "They are all about pack behavior, about being social: they are constantly noticing the world around them."
- |
  

- Dogs don&#8217;t read, they don&#8217;t reprogram your computer.
- |
  

- "But they&#8217;re very good at seeing when someone is trying to be friendly to you, or when someone is threatening you: exactly the things an autist misses."
- |
  

- The two, it seems, are made for each other.

  Paul Collins&#8217;s recent book  Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism  combines a memoir about his son Morgan with a travelogue into the past and present of autism and neurology. This excerpt visits a prison near Green Bay, Wisconsin. Paul&#8217;s update on the fate of this program will appear tomorrow.
