- SHOAL, TONY, OLLIE at bar.
- |
  

- Enter YOGI .
- "YOGI: Fellow barflies, hear ye: I have been abducted!"
- "OLLIE: Again?"
- "YOGI: Snatched, studied, and safely returned."
- |
  

- Shoal, I will take no No to my request for a pinch of your top-shelf Irish; you will note I have never before ordered precisely that; I will tell you that never before have I had occasion.
- |
  

- Thirstier I have never been, and never so selective, aristocrat that I am.
- |
  

- Do not deny me, Shoal.
- |
  

- A dryer man never thought you so beautiful.
- "SHOAL: Just one shelf, Yogi."
- "YOGI: Then that supremely unique shelf let it be."
- |
  

- A drink for a man with a tale to tell.
- |
  

- Neat please for the shelf-reliant.
- |
  

- You are feasting your eyes, if you have any appetite to see, upon a man who has known the carnal embrace of an alien!
- "TONY: Probably after a green card."
- "YOGI: Was she green?"
- |
  

- No she was not.
- |
  

- She was no Saturday morning cartoon I can tell you.
- |
  

- She appeared to me in most mature form.
- |
  

- Most recognizable!
- |
  

- I'm sure she would agree.
- |
  

- Friends, I can take your ribbing without offence, for I stand and sit and drink as an acquaintance of a higher truth.
- |
  

- I have been abducted by beings from another universe.
- "OLLIE: Thought you were one of 'em."
- "YOGI: Absolved, resurrected, transported, and safely returned."
- |
  

- As a matter of fact yes I do think they took me for a kindred intelligence.
- "TONY: God help this planet!"
- "YOGI: I was out in the woods in my anti-bear suit and the light from their ship reflected off me and they approached me."
- |
  

- A triangular object, big as three football fields with lights on the corners and wings&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Shoal, there is air in my glass.
- |
  

- I like that shelf, it's a dance-floor, thank you.
- |
  

- Nature do abhor a vacuum.
- "OLLIE: See any bears tonight, Yogi?"
- "YOGI: I saw  past  the bears, Ollie."
- |
  

- You probably don't know what I'm talking about; that's OK, you're a good man and I'm proud to snow you.
- |
  

- I would like to buy you a drink.
- |
  

- I would like to flood All your gates&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Shoal, for everyone!
- "SHOAL: That's very kind of you, Yogi, I'll need to see the money."
- "YOGI: Shoal."
- |
  

- At this very moment you may be talking to the father of a half-man, half-extraterrestrial child, if that's not occasion for drinks all around, I'm a teetotaler till I die.
- |
  

- That's all I need is another paternity suit.
- "SHOAL: Cash up front, Yogi."
- "OLLIE: I was attacked by a bear one time."
- "TONY: How's Hannah feel about you're extraterrestrial affair?"
- "YOGI: Hannah has been very supportive."
- |
  

- Here is my cash up front.
- "SHOAL: Not cute."
- YOGI
- |
  

- I'm as dry as the crack in a cavern
- |
  

- I've been so for an hour
- |
  

- Come on, Shoal, on the house!
- |
  

- Tony, on the house, come on!
- "OLLIE: Special occasion!"
- "TONY: Every day's a special occasion."
- "YOGI: That's true."
- |
  

- But this is truly unusual!
- |
  

- Did you hear what I said, I was abducted&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I'm sorry, I promised no cursing&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I was seduced!
- |
  

- Aw Christ.
- |
  

- All right.
- |
  

- You want a special occasion, people?
- |
  

- I got a job.
- |
  

- OK?
- |
  

- Praise the lord, I got a job.
- "TONY: Bullshit."
- "OLLIE: The aliens hired you?"
- "YOGI: No, Ollie."
- |
  

- The government.
- "SHOAL: YOU got a job?"
- "OLLIE: Hey Shoal, maybe Yogi can get you a job bartending on his flying saucer."
- "YOGI: Here."
- |
  

- I got proof.
- |
  

- Read that and tell me I don't have a job.
- |
  

- See who it's from?
- "OLLIE: I hear they drink lots of Bacardi 51."
- "TONY [looks at letter]: What is this?"
- "OLLIE: Get it, Tony?"
- |
  

- Bacardi 51?
- "YOGI: I have been hired by the government of Teddyville to escort our leader single-handedly through the glorious woodlands of Sanford Park."
- "OLLIE: Oooh I like that stationery&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;that's good stock."
- "YOGI: Not bad for a down and out ranger!"
- "TONY: I don't believe this."
- "YOGI: The insignia, Tony, feel it."
- |
  

- Bumpy, right?
- "SHOAL: The governor's coming to Left Teddy?"
- "YOGI: And through it, guided by Yours Truly, fill 'er up please."
- "OLLIE: No, I heard Left Teddy."
- "YOGI: You heard right."
- |
  

- Shoal?
- |
  

- "Shoal: I promised  myself , I'm entitled to break a promise to  myself ."
- "OLLIE: Consistency is the hop goblin."
- |
  

- "TONY: How'd they find you?"
- |
  

- Why'd they pick you?
- "YOGI: Be like riding a bicycle."
- |
  

- Shoal, I knew you'd be there for me.
- |
  

- I'm gonna introduce you to the governor, I'm gonna introduce everyone here, anyone buys me a drink I'll introduce you to the governor, that's it, fill 'er up, little bit more&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;thank you.
- |
  

- A toast!
- |
  

- A toast to our governor and to our great bottums up!
