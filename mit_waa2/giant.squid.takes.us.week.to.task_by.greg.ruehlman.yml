- OK,  Us , you've had your fun.
- |
  

- Now you best pay attention.
- |
  

- Those pictures you took crossed a lot of lines, and I, Giant Squid, want to set some ground rules if you ever want me to cooperate again.
- |
  

- Giant Squid doesn't have a lot of patience.
- Not all of the pictures made Giant Squid mad.
- |
  

- "The first ones of me underwater, for example\x97those were all right."
- |
  

- Nonintrusive, plenty of Japanese scientists on hand to make it legit.
- |
  

- All in all, pretty understandable, pretty exciting even, considering that Giant Squid hadn't ever been photographed in his natural environment before.
- |
  

- Hell, I've been a giant squid my whole life, and even now sometimes just the fact that a creature like me exists is enough to make Giant Squid ink himself.
- |
  

- For the sake of science, Giant Squid is glad you're happy with those shots.
- |
  

- Giant Squid saw some of them on Yahoo!
- |
  

- But now it's gotten out of hand.
- |
  

- Why did you have to take pictures of Giant Squid skiing in Switzerland with his children?
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Was that really necessary?
- |
  

- The kids don't deserve this.
- |
  

- They didn't ask for their father to be a magnet for vulture paparazzi.
- |
  

- You know that Giant Squid is divorced and that Sierra, Murmur, and Sol live with their mother.
- |
  

- Giant Squid's time with his kids is precious.
- |
  

- The least you could do is respect that.
- |
  

- Is it too much to ask that you don't follow Giant Squid to Interlaken?
- |
  

- No, it's not.
- What's the deal, anyways?
- |
  

- Do you honestly get a thrill out of this?
- |
  

- "\"Ooh, look, Giant Squid takes out his garbage\x97he's just like us!"
- "\" \""
- "Ooh, there's Giant Squid grappling 15 rolls of toilet paper with his tentacles at the grocery store\x97that's what we do, too!"
- "\" \""
- Ooh, here's a pic of the  Architeuthis  hanging out in the Christian Science reading room.
- "\" \""
- "Ooh, here's a photo of Squid suctioning himself to a sunken Korean destroyer ship\x97he's the same as everyone else!"
- Big .
- |
  

- Last week was the breaking point for Giant Squid.
- |
  

- There you were, like, "Oh, hey, Squid's gonna be hanging out at the Dodgers game tonight with his new girlfriend, Neve Campbell.
- |
  

- Let's go provoke him, la la la!
- "\" And suddenly there are like three  Us  photographers in our section, not even pretending to watch baseball."
- |
  

- I was  this close  to going  20,000 Leagues  on those assholes, and, just to warn you, Giant Squid can never predict when Giant Squid's gonna just flip out on some dude.
- |
  

- I'm the great enigma of the deep and even I don't know half of what I do.
- |
  

- Giant Squid is shrouded in mystery, y'all.
- So, to summarize, here's how it's going to work from now on.
- |
  

- When the kraken is in New York, will pictures of him eating sushi at Masa with his lady companion Neve Campbell show up in  Us Weekly ?
- |
  

- No, they will not.
- |
  

- Giant Squid says that the madness stops .
- |
  

- You will consult Giant Squid about all future photos.
- |
  

- Else you might find one of your fancy cameras in my beak.
- |
  

- Giant Squid ain't lying.
