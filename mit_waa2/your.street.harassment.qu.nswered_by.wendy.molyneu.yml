- Hey, baby!
- |
  

- Do fries come with that shake?
- Actually, with this shake, you get a choice of sides.
- |
  

- "You can have regular or curly fries, jalape\xF1o poppers, or a side salad."
- What kinds of dressing do you have?
- You can get ranch, honey-mustard, or lite Italian.
- What about onion rings?
- They're a dollar extra.
- Can I get this to go?
- Yes!
- |
  

- And you can also shove it up your ass, you fucking idiot.
- |
  

- Pardon me, miss.
- |
  

- I seem to have lost my phone number.
- |
  

- Could I borrow yours?
- Do you mean that you forgot it, or that you actually misplaced it?
- It's weird, but I actually misplaced it.
- But that's impossible.
- |
  

- A number is abstract.
- |
  

- How could you misplace it?
- I'm not supposed to say this, but I work for the government, and time and space are collapsing.
- |
  

- Abstract concepts have acquired actual mass, and can now be misplaced.
- So, do you think you might lose your chauvinism?
- |
  

- And your lack of respect for other people?
- I hope not.
- |
  

- That's kind of what I'm about.
- |
  

- Hey, can I get in your pants?
- I think they might be too small for you.
- All right, then.
- |
  

- Can I get in your shirt?
- But I'm wearing a floral blouse.
- |
  

- Aren't you worried that these guys you're hanging out on the porch with will laugh at you or call you names if you wear a blouse?
- Well, if they do that, I guess they're not really my friends.
- Wow, you're a lot more secure than I would have expected.
- |
  

- And deeper.
- Yeah, it's weird.
- |
  

- I woke up this morning and my low self-esteem had vanished.
- That's probably because time and space are collapsing, and abstract concepts have acquired physical form, meaning that we can lose them.
- So, do you think you'll lose that chip on your shoulder?
- God, I hope not.
- |
  

- It's kind of what I'm about.
