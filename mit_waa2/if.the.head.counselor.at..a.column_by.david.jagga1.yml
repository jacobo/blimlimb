- "Q:  The other day I left an open bowl of barbecue sauce in the fridge and it made all my fruits and dairy products taste like garlic."
- |
  

- What can I do to protect delicate foods from a penetrating odor when I'm out of plastic cling wrap?
- "A: Go out and buy some."
- |
  

- What's the big deal?
- |
  

- "Q:  Hi!"
- |
  

- Can you tell me the easiest way to get baked-on food residues off a roasting pan?
- |
  

- Is steel wool best?
- "A: You think life is supposed to be \"easy\"? The way to get residues off a pan is to get your butt off the Barcalounger and scrub that thing until I can see my reflection in it! Show some elbow grease! And you can use a mascara brush for all I care."
- |
  

- "Q:  How can I get a soy-sauce stain off a white leather couch?"
- "A: OHFERCRIPESSAKE!"
- |
  

- You spilled SOY SAUCE on the COUCH?
- |
  

- What were you doing, binging on takeout in front of the boob tube instead of eating a home-cooked meal at the table with your family?
- |
  

- Jeez Louise, I'm not even going to answer this one.
- |
  

- You can just get a summer job like I did and earn the money to buy a new couch.
- |
  

- Howdaya like them apples, Slobby Slobberson?
- |
  

- "Q:  After a trip to the barbershop, I always have lots of little hairs stuck to the inside of my collar and T-shirt, and the itching and chafing drive me nuts."
- |
  

- Is there any way to remedy this besides just taking a shower and changing clothes?
- "A: No. Whassamatter, can't take a little itching once in a while?"
- |
  

- Learn to live with it, bub.
- |
  

- And, by the way, you should get your hair cut more often.
- |
  

- "Q:  I broke my grandmother's best china serving platter, which I had borrowed for a dinner party."
- |
  

- It's a straight, clean break and I'm hoping I can glue it back together so she won't notice.
- |
  

- What kind of glue is best for porcelain?
- "A: Whoa, Whoa, WHOA!"
- |
  

- You think I'm going to help you LIE to your grandmother?
- |
  

- I'm ashamed of you!
- |
  

- You march RIGHT over there RIGHT now and tell her what you did and offer to replace that platter out of your own savings.
- |
  

- Then drop and give me 50.
- |
  

- "Q:  I love to eat ice cream in the summer, but I suffer from lactose intolerance, and dairy products make me, well, to put it bluntly, flatulent to a degree that positively beggars belief."
- |
  

- Is there anything I can eat or drink with the ice cream that might help counter this problem?
- "A: Wait\x97something I don't get here: why is this a problem?"
- |
  

- "Q:  Dandelions seem to be taking over my entire lawn."
- |
  

- What's the best way to kill them and keep them from growing back?
- "A: HEY!"
- |
  

- Ever hear of a little thing called "work"? I want to see you front and center in that yard at 0600 hours, yanking those dandelions out by the roots. Then seal them in a trash bag and bury it 5 feet deep at least 400 yards from your lawn. Repeat this every three days and you won't have any damn weeds. Pardon my French.
- |
  

- "Q:  I accidentally cut my thumb pretty badly while carving a chicken with a steak knife."
- |
  

- Would it be safer to use one of those big electric knives even for smaller fowl like chicken?
- "A: OK, OK\x97don't tell me!"
- |
  

- "Let me guess: you were goofing off with the knife, horsing around to impress your buddies, right?"
- |
  

- Well, now you see what happens when you don't treat tools with respect.
- |
  

- You're lucky you didn't slice that thumb right-clean-zango OFF!
- |
  

- As for an electric knife, you can't have one until you've proven to me that you can be trusted to use it safely.
- OK, everybody, listen up!
- |
  

- Announcement time!
- The annual Bleach vs.
- |
  

- Ammonia Users volleyball tourney will be on Saturday at 3 o'clock.
- |
  

- And there will be  no throwing cleaning products on the other team  like last year.
- |
  

- I hope I've made that clear.
- "Another thing: We've been getting a lot of letters asking how to improve home security without investing in an expensive alarm system."
- |
  

- "So we're going to have a little contest: I want everybody to work out a way to protect their home against intruders and terrorists using nothing but a sharp stick, an empty coffee can, two C batteries, a corncob, and 5 yards of gimp."
- |
  

- Submit your projects by Thursday and we'll choose the best ones.
- |
  

- And we've got some pretty nice prizes, too.
- |
  

- "First prize: a watermelon!"
- |
  

- "Second prize: a home-security alarm system."
- |
  

- Sound good?
- |
  

- It sure is, but you're not going to win anything just sitting there!
- |
  

- Get the lead out!
- |
  

- C'mon, let's move it, move it, MOVE IT!
- |
  

- OK, see you next week.
- |
  

- Dis- MISSED!
