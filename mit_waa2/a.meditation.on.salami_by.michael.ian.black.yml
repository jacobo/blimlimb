- Tangier than bologna, rounder than ham, exoticker than turkey, salami has never gotten its proper due.
- |
  

- Which is sad, considering that salami  IS THE GREATEST LUNCHMEAT IN THE WORLD !
- |
  

- If I seem a little overenthusiastic, it is perhaps because salami has so many detractors.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- "For starters, the name: salami."
- |
  

- It sounds stupid, like a reject from the Seven Dwarfs.
- |
  

- Sleepy, Grumpy, Salami.
- Or like an acronym for something else.
- |
  

- "SaLAMI: Sandwich Lovers All Make It."
- |
  

- That's a terrible example of what the acronym for salami could be, but I think you get my point.
- Also, salami seems to awaken the xenophobia in people.
- |
  

- It's kind of Italian, but kind of New Yorky (Jewish), and it seems like exactly the kind of food that terrorists might enjoy.
- |
  

- One could easily imagine a group of bearded cave dwellers gnawing on hunks of salami while plotting the demise of the Great Satan.
- |
  

- Of course, one could also easily imagine that same group juggling bowling balls on the moon, for the simple reason that imagining stuff is easy.
- |
  

- "A quick note: I'm not ascribing any superhuman juggling abilities to terrorists."
- |
  

- Far from it.
- |
  

- If anything, juggling bowling balls on the moon would be considerably easier than here on Earth, due to the moon's lower gravity.
- |
  

- Besides, terrorists probably hate juggling, because juggling is one of our freedoms.
- |
  

- Probably the biggest modern objection to salami is that it falls into that category of foods made from the leftover parts of other foods.
- |
  

- "A piece of salami, mottled in various attractive shades of pink and white, is like some kind of Frankenstein creation: a little beef, a little pork, and a lot of other stuff."
- |
  

- Horse lips, for example.
- "Well, if salami is merely a hodgepodge concoction from whatever is left on the slaughterhouse floor, then give me a broom and tell me where to start sweeping, because salami, for all its faults, is delicious: salty, greasy, and just the right amount of chewy."
- |
  

- It's no wonder that the word "salami" is also informally used in baseball circles to describe a grand-slam home run. It's just that good. What other lunchmeat can make that claim? Never will liverwurst be used to describe anything other than liverwurst.
- And salami is versatile.
- |
  

- Yes, it's a sandwich staple.
- |
  

- But it's also great with scrambled eggs.
- |
  

- And fabulous on pizza.
- |
  

- How about as the foundation for a killer antipasto salad?
- |
  

- "Or simply rolled up and savored with my favorite: a tall, room-temperature bottle of Bud Light!"
- Also, salami doesn't spoil like other luncheon meats.
- |
  

- Try leaving a pound of ham outside on a hot day for a few hours.
- |
  

- See what happens.
- |
  

- "Actually, I'll tell you so you don't waste food: it goes bad."
- |
  

- Salami just gets more delicious.
- |
  

- And more warm.
- Some people think salami is bad for you.
- |
  

- Yes, it's high in the kind of fat that gives people heart attacks, but I compared the life expectancy of Italians versus the life expectancy of United States of Americans.
- |
  

- Guess what I discovered?
- |
  

- Italians live longer!
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Because salami is literally the only thing they eat over there!
- |
  

- "Another quick note: We both know that Italians eat other foods besides salami, but I felt like it was OK to use a little \"dramatic license\" here. For the record, Italians also eat spaghetti and cannoli.)"
- Now I know salami isn't "cool.
- "\" \""
- Cool" people like that pretty girl from  Boston Legal  aren't sitting around in their yachts in Beverly Hills snacking on salami.
- |
  

- So what?
- |
  

- "Being a celebrity myself (very famous), I know a lot of those so-called \"cool\" people, and let me tell you something: a lot of them are very unhappy."
- |
  

- Is there a correlation between their unhappiness and the lack of salami in their diets?
- |
  

- I'm not saying yes.
- |
  

- On the other hand, I am most decidedly not saying no.
- All I'm asking is that the next time you find yourself brown-paper-bagging it, you give salami another look.
- |
  

- Maybe you'll walk away from the experience with a shrug.
- |
  

- So be it.
- |
  

- But maybe, just maybe, you'll finish up that lunch with a smile on your face, the kind of smile that announces to the world, "Either I just ate a salami sandwich or else I'm wearing a little too much lip gloss.
