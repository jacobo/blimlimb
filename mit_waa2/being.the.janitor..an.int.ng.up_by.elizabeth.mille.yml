- "Q: How did you end up being a janitor?"
- "O'Donnell: I was in school during the day so I needed a job that I could work at night."
- |
  

- So, I got a job as a janitor at an insurance company and I did that for a little while.
- |
  

- My wife Carrie worked as a janitor for another company, and one day she told me that they had just fired someone and needed to hire someone to take his place.
- |
  

- So I moved over to that company because I would be working with Carrie cleaning these doctors' offices.
- |
  

- Later on I found out the guy whose place I took got fired because he was stealing drug samples.
- "Q: How did you go from cleaning a doctor's office to cleaning a tortilla factory?"
- "O'Donnell: The janitorial company just needed someone to clean the factory so they sent me over there."
- "Q: How many people cleaned with you?"
- "O'Donnell: Oh, it was just me."
- "Q: You cleaned the whole thing all by yourself?"
- "O'Donnell: Well, it wasn't the entire factory."
- |
  

- I wasn't cleaning the assembly line where they made the tortillas.
- |
  

- I was cleaning the kitchen, the bakery, the break room, stuff like that.
- "Q: Are we talking full-on disinfecting here?"
- |
  

- Or just sweeping and mopping?
- "O'Donnell: It depended on which room it was."
- |
  

- There was the bakery, where they made just regular Mexican pastries, so at the end of the day there was this quarter-inch thick layer of flour and colored sugar all over the floor.
- |
  

- Little footprints in it and everything.
- |
  

- I dusted the flour off of everything and then started to mop up all the goo on the floor that had built up throughout the day.
- "Q: And you mopped it up with water?"
- "O'Donnell: Yes."
- "Q: And water plus flour."
- |
  

- "O'Donnell: Makes glue."
- |
  

- I dumped and refilled the mop bucket at least three times just to clean one room.
- "Q: Was that the most difficult part to clean?"
- "O'Donnell: Well, once I was done with the bakery I moved on to the break room."
- |
  

- The break room was not that bad.
- |
  

- The worst thing I found was food spilled on the table.
- |
  

- And then there was the bathroom.
- |
  

- Oh.
- |
  

- There is.
- |
  

- Sewer systems are not the same in every country.
- |
  

- In some countries, the sewer systems don't have the capacity that they have here.
- |
  

- So, depending on where you are, it is often times common practice to not flush your used toilet paper down the toilet.
- |
  

- So, um, what you do is, uh, cleanse yourself and then deposit your used toilet paper in a trashcan.
- |
  

- This is the theory, at least.
- |
  

- So, there were these huge, four-foot-tall, two-foot-wide square trashcans in the bathrooms that, of course, I had to take the bags out of every night and throw away.
- |
  

- Now, the real downside to this was that the trashcans had a plastic rim around the top and were located a few feet from the toilet itself.
- |
  

- So, someone would have a piece of soiled toilet paper in their hand, and they would then try to throw it into the trashcan and it wouldn't always go right in.
- |
  

- Sometimes it would hit the wall first or bounce off of the rim of the trashcan before going in.
- |
  

- Sometimes it would not go in at all.
- "Q: Why didn't anyone ever, you know, move the trashcan closer to the toilet?"
- "O'Donnell: I don't know."
- |
  

- I just don't know.
- "Q: What else got made at this factory besides tortillas?"
- "O'Donnell: Different sorts of Mexican pastries."
- "Q: Did you develop an aversion to tortillas and Mexican pastries when you worked there because you had to clean up their mess?"
- "O'Donnell: Oh, no."
- |
  

- After working there I developed an incredible addiction to tortillas.
- |
  

- By the time I got to cleaning the break room the foreman of the tortilla factory and a couple of other guys were on a break.
- |
  

- Because this was a tortilla factory the people who worked there could get as many tortillas as they wanted.
- |
  

- So, they brought in all sorts of Tupperware containers filled with things to eat with the tortillas&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;meat, beans, rice all mixed up and cooked.
- |
  

- They took that, heated up some corn tortillas, and then ate it for dinner.
- |
  

- Now, because there was so much food there, and I spoke Spanish and they happened to like me, they all shared their food with me.
- |
  

- I got all the tortillas I wanted to eat.
- "Q: Do you think working in the tortilla factory or being the janitor in the tortilla factory was a worse job?"
- "O'Donnell: Hmmm."
- |
  

- Well, I pretty much think that no matter how bad a job is, being a janitor at that job is going to be worse.
- |
  

- I mean, you're the janitor for god's sake.
- "Q: What about a sewer treatment plant?"
- "O'Donnell: What?"
- "Q: What about working in a sewer treatment plant?"
- |
  

- People who work there have to wade around in pools of poo while wearing those tall fish wading pants.
- "O'Donnell: Right, but then those people get out and who has to clean up where they've been walking?"
- |
  

- Who has to clean the fish wading pants when they're done with them?
- |
  

- That's right, it's the janitor.
- "Q: Oh, yeah."
- |
  

- Good point.
- "O'Donnell: Of course, there are some advantages to being the janitor."
- |
  

- For instance, the giant tubs of cookie dough.
- "Q: What?"
- "O'Donnell: In the bakery there were these giant tubs of cookie dough."
- "Q: And."
- |
  

- "O'Donnell: Well, you know, there wasn't anyone around and there was just all this cookie dough there."
- "Q: You would just grab cookie dough and eat it?"
- "O'Donnell: Sure."
- "Q: What else was just sitting around?"
- "O'Donnell: Well, there were the giant tubs of cookie dough, and different kinds of pastry dough."
- |
  

- Frosting.
- |
  

- Stuff like that.
- "Q: And you would eat all this?"
- "O'Donnell: Oh, no."
- |
  

- Just the cookie dough.
- "Q: Not the frosting?"
- "O'Donnell: Well."
- |
  

- "Q: So the janitor finally wins?"
- "O'Donnell: The janitor finally wins."
