  Last night, after drinking seven shots of  _____  (least favorite hard liquor) and snorting enough  _____  (cocaine) to make  _____  (politician) blush, it became clear:  It really is them, and not me.
  I am the one who is completely  _____  (helpless state of being) when it comes to the  _____  (favorite color) personal relationships in my life, and yet, I share my innermost  _____  (type of candy) with no one else on this  _____  (adjective) planet ... because they are all  _____  (insulting adjective)  _____  (extinct animals). I  _____  (hate) them all, and I hope they meet a  _____  (adjective) demise, choking on a platter of their own  _____  (Applebee's appetizer).
  This  _____  (adjective) catharsis made me feel  _____  (smiley emotion) and strangely alone, simultaneously.

  Today I have decided to buy a  _____  (noun), which will serve as a  _____  (metaphor), and as a  _____  (timeless adjective) symbol for the  _____  (expletive)-faced servitude I am bound to in this life ... no more in control than the most  _____  (adjective)-minded of  _____  (farm animals).
