- ALFRED HITCHCOCK COMPLAINS ABOUT HIS HOTEL ROOM.

- BY  ANDREW MEEK
- |
  

- Firstly, the curtains.
- |
  

- It is my feeling that all windows should have blinds, as they present infinitely more appeal for both the user and the onlooker.
- |
  

- "Observe the opening credits of  Rear Window : the bamboo blinds roll away one at a time, gradually revealing the set, teasing the viewer like the Dance of the Seven Veils."
- |
  

- They also afford a clearer silhouette and thus play to the power of suggestion.
- "In a similar vein, the view from any window should be a carefully executed mise en sc\xE8ne, uncluttered but artful and rewarding of one's prolonged attention."
- |
  

- A handful of extras crossing back and forth; the rumble of the occassional automobile, perhaps.
- |
  

- A close-up view of a bare red-brick wall will hardly suffice.
- |
  

- This is not the stuff that enduring Hollywood iconography is made of.
- The room itself, while spacious, is lacking in certain dramatic accoutrements.
- |
  

- My wardrobe is scarcely deep enough to admit my assistant, a very slight gentleman of diminished stature, and would certainly not permit my own entrance.
- |
  

- When the visual dimensions of a piece of furniture rule out any possibility of a killer (or killers) dwelling within, then we are all left the worse for it.
- |
  

- "Perhaps another room\x97dare I suggest the presidential suite\x97might afford a more pleasing topography?"
- I am also less than pleased with the facilities.
- |
  

- "The en suite d\xE9cor is twee to the point of insult."
- |
  

- All bathrooms should be brilliant white to contrast with the emission of certain bodily fluids or chocolate sauce.
- |
  

- My bathtub is green.
- |
  

- Dark green.
- |
  

- This simply will not do.
- Lastly, I am horrified by the lack of peepholes drilled into my walls.
- |
  

- I had my assistant remove every picture frame and scour behind every fixture (the aforementioned wardrobe presenting scandalously little in the way of difficulty) and he found not a single pinprick.
- |
  

- What of voyeurism, I ask?
- |
  

- Anthony Perkins must be turning in his grave.
- While I realize that some of my requirements may seem a little odd, even anathema, to the bulk of your clientele, I hope you'll be able to accommodate my needs.
- |
  

- Oh, please don't mistake my modest requests for some ghoulish desire to see myself and others slaughtered in our beds like so many pigs.
- |
  

- I abhor the idea that a knife-wielding maniac is at large in the building even as we speak, waiting and plotting his next murder, but I enjoy the thought that he  could  be.
