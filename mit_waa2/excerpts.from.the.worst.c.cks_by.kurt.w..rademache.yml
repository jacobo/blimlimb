- Be open and honest; this may be difficult, but it will help you heal emotionally as time passes.

- If possible, choose to speak first so that you can set a mature tone for the conversation and make your points dispassionately.

- Make eye contact as you speak.
- |
  

- This should keep your partner's gaze from your hands while you adjust the fuel primer switch to setting X9 and the combustion-pressure selector to 200 psi, for maximum velocity.
