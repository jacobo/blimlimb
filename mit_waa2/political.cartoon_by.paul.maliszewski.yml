  The likeness of George W. Bush is attempting to cross a tightrope labeled
  "Vice Presidential Candidate Selection Process." Bush, who's labeled "Bush"
  down his right arm and "W" down his left, with "George" neatly stitched to
  his back, is dressed as a circus performer, in one-piece, Wallenda-ish
  tights. The air above Bush's head is labeled "Circus-like Atmosphere."
  On the ground, several busy assistants, identified as "GOP," "Party
  Faithful," and "College Republicans" by words intaglioed in the sawdust,
  train spotlights labeled "Public Attention," "Free Air Time," and "Tonight's
  Top Story" on Bush as he executes his walk. Inches behind Bush, perched on a
  spindly wooden stand, are men in identical suits, ties, and shirts. They are
  his advisers, labeled as such on lapels, sleeves, or cuffs of pairs of
  pants. Two of them aim megaphones at Bush's nearest ear. One megaphone is
  labeled "Latest Overnight Poll Results as Expressed in a Percentage." The
  other is labeled "What We've Been Hearing, Constituency-wise." Various
  musical notes together form a song titled "Now a Few Words of Advice,
  Wisdom, and Caution," that pours forth in the candidate's direction.
  Uncle Sam acts as the ringleader. This emcee gig is a side project for him,
  one of a small handful of personal appearances he accepts. Wearing Uncle
  Sam's costume is Dick Cheney, who sports a sticker on his topcoat,
  explaining: "Hello, My Name Is... Dick Cheney."
  In front of Bush, on another spindly wooden stand, is a representation of
  the city of Philadelphia, with its orderly squares, South Street, and that
  wide set of marble steps leading to the Museum of Art. A tiny banner above
  the city proclaims, "Republican Convention in Philadelphia." The two sticks
  holding the flapping banner aloft are carved with the words, "Super
  Delegates" and "Volunteers are Super Also."
  Beyond Philadelphia, another, steeper tightrope begins and recedes into the
  haze of that circus-like atmosphere. This second tightrope, labeled along its
  length "Big Election 2000 in Putatively Energized Post-Convention Mode,"
  approaches a tiny white house labeled "The White House."
  Bush meanwhile has a real balancing act on his hands. Out in front of him he
  holds a long pole (a manufacturer's sticker warns, "Widely Acknowledged
  Criteria for the Selection of One's VP"). Tied to the nearest end of the
  pole is an anvil labeled "Gravitas." Tied to the other end is a two-pan
  scale labeled "Loyalty, with a Soup&#231;on of Justice and Fairness for Good
  Measure." Tied to the third end is a skull, whose teeth are covered with
  gold caps, each engraved with a letter detailing this message: "Most
  important, bear in mind that the ideal vice presidential candidate should do
  you no harm. Good night. God bless." The pole describes a tremendous frown
  in the air.
  The presidential candidate's vice-presidential candidates are seated in
  chairs (collectively labeled "Places on the Purported Short List") balanced
  on poles ("Being Raised to National Prominence") and held steady by more
  "Party Faithful." Bush lifts a prospective, carries that individual on his
  back, as a test-drive, to see how the likeness of Bush and the likeness of
  the prospective work together, all while remaining balanced, and then gently
  eases that person back into the chair.
  A machine of many components, bristling with dials, buttons, and LED
  read-outs, does its inscrutable machine thing. This is "The Political
  Machine," as can be plainly read on the stainless steel plaque riveted to
  
  its body. People carrying pieces of wood under their arms have surrounded
  The Political Machine. The pieces of wood look to be twelve inches wide by
  one inch thick by ten feet long. Stapled to the ends of the lumber are tags:
  "For Use in Constructing Political Platform." The people carrying the wood
  represent "Special Interest Groups, as the 288-point white lettering on
  their black briefcases clearly read.
  Lady Liberty and the bald eagle are on a date. Lady Liberty acts like she
  wants to be anywhere else. The bald eagle has issues.
  A wooden sign hammered into the ground marks a puddle of mud: "For Campaign
  Purposes." A barrel the size of a Winnebago spills something called
  "National resources" into the arena. Uncle Sam/Dick Cheney hot-foots it to
  higher ground, maintaining his patter. Members of the media, denoted the
  old-fashioned way by cards stuck into hatbands reading "Press," huddle in
  the grandstand under a wide umbrella stenciled with a floral design: "At
  least we have plausible objectivity, right?" Some journalists brandish
  magnifying glasses ("Media Scrutiny") and binoculars ("No Privacy for Public
  Figures").
  Workers in jumpsuits identified by "Texas Prison Commission" patches remove
  bodies from a lethal-injection gurney and load skeletons into coffins.
  Previously filled coffins are lowered into the ground. Their graves, marked by 
  plain stones, are endangered by that flood of
  national resources, symbolizing both the wide-ranging systematic cover-up
  abetted by the misallocation of resources and the importance of respecting
  the dead.
  Protesters against the death penalty aim arrows, labeled with ingenious
  rhymes incorporating the words "Bush" and "Death," along with expletives
  indicated by keyboard symbols&#151;"#*%$(&!"&#151;and assail the candidate. At

  likeness of Bush. The second bug looks askance at his gullible friend, who
  by now is clapping or staring wide-eyed or doing something to indicate even
  more clearly its stupidity. "Everybody loves the circus," notes the second
  bug&#151;deeply ironically, as is evidenced by the way it squints its bug eyes
  and raises one bug eyebrow.
  Up above, in the sky, suspended over the crickets, the crowd, and the
  political machine, above Uncle Sam/Dick Cheney and the advisers, above the
  hailstorm of arrows and Bush, who teeters then totters but regains his
  balance, above the top of the tent even: a five-fingered fist of ham
  threatens to squash them all where they stand.
