- "\"There are good jokes,\""
- |
  

- "\"and there are bad jokes, and then there are jokes that are worse than bad, jokes that make bad jokes look like good jokes, or better."
- |
  

- This was the kind of joke that emerged from the mouth of a woman I planned to marry, a woman with whom I had already picked a date and place, selected table linen, looked through books of cakes, nodding sagely at cakes that did not offend my sensibilities, shaking my head at those that did.
- |
  

- We planned the wedding nearly every evening, after we both came home from work, and for the most part our tastes were in harmony.
- |
  

- One Friday, we decided to walk down the street to a new Italian restaurant that had received an enthusiastic review in the local paper.
- |
  

- We sat and ordered.
- |
  

- She had linguini.
- |
  

- I had Chicken Tetrazinni.
- |
  

- I am tired,' I said.
- |
  

- This hasn't been the best week at work.
- |
  

- And I feel a little old these days.
- |
  

- It's ridiculous, I know, because I'm not old.
- |
  

- I was twenty-eight.
- |
  

- It's just that some days I sit there at my desk and wonder if this is what I'll be doing for the rest of my life.
- |
  

- I was a financial writer.
- |
  

- Do you know how long that is?
- |
  

- The rest of your life?
- |
  

- I guess that's part of the problem.
- |
  

- No one knows how long it is.
- |
  

- But it could be a long time.
- |
  

- It's scary to think about working a job for the rest of your life, just like it's scary to think about being with one person for the rest of your life.
- |
  

- How long have we been together?
- |
  

- We had been together four years.
- |
  

- It seems like this is the thing we're supposed to do, to get married, right?
- |
  

- And I hope it is.
- |
  

- I guess I just have cold feet.
- |
  

- My feet were not cold; it was a figure of speech.
- |
  

- Anyway, I hope the Chicken Tetrazinni is good.
- |
  

- I am hungry.
- |
  

- "\"'Can I tell you a joke?"
- |
  

- "\"'Sure,' I said."
- |
  

- I was distracted.
- "\"'There is this country,' she said."
- |
  

- Not here.
- |
  

- Not the United States.
- |
  

- And they have a Presidential election, and one candidate wins by a landslide.
- |
  

- Almost everyone who goes into the voting booths comes out with broad smiles on their pale white faces.
- |
  

- It's obvious that this candidate, whose name I won't say, is the best candidate, and the one that's the most beloved.
- |
  

- When he appears on TV, he has this very serious expression on his pale white face, but not stern or angry.
- |
  

- A serious, loving expression.
- |
  

- So anyway, he wins, with like seventy percent of the popular vote, which is pretty damned good, and he is inaugurated, and he gets up to the podium to make his speech.
- |
  

- And here's the speech.
- |
  

- She said nothing.
- |
  

- Get it?
- |
  

- Because he's a mime.
- |
  

- It's a whole country of mimes.
- |
  

- That's why they have the pale white faces.
- |
  

- "\"Thus was the seed of doubt planted."
- |
  

- I cannot remark upon the quality of the Chicken Tetrazinni.
- |
  

- My mind was elsewhere.
- |
  

- And three months later, on the day we had set aside for our marriage, I was elsewhere, too, with another woman, in another life, although in that other life I was still a financial writer.
- |
  

- I do not know what happened to the woman I planned to marry.
- |
  

- The break was clean, and rapid.
- "Next:  Day Five"
- "Previous:  Day Three"
- |
