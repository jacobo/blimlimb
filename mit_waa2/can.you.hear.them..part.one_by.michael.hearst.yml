- I never  really  knew if Marvin was my mom's boyfriend or just a  friend , but he seemed pretty cool nonetheless.
- |
  

- I remember him for his straight, dirty blond hair and his laid back demeanor.
- |
  

- He seemed to have a slight smart-ass quality that clung to him at all times.
- |
  

- Maybe it was the squint in his eyes that gave the illusion that he knew more than he was letting on.
- |
  

- Regardless, my brother and I thought he was pretty cool.
- |
  

- I was in the third grade at the time and my brother Ben was in the fifth.
- |
  

- "Other things I remember about this year were: my orange and black Vans with checkerboard sides; piano lessons at Mrs. Launderai's house (AKA Mrs. Laundry); Iola Underdew, our once-a-week maid who burped a lot; her husband, Zolly Underdew who took care of the yard; Mark Moser, who was more of my brother's friend than mine, but whom I worshiped (He called Iola, Ayatollah Iola)."
- |
  

- There were Cookie and Bah, the feline companions we adored and thought of as family.
- |
  

- The  Star Wars  wallpaper in my bedroom, but only on the wall with the window facing the driveway.
- |
  

- And there was Kelly Davis, the cute girl with freckles at school.
- |
  

- She had me and all my friends fighting over who would have her hand in marriage.
- |
  

- I also remember going to Old Donation Gifted and Talented School.
- |
  

- I hated being "gifted and talented.
- "\" This meant that I had to leave all my friends at my normal elementary school on Wednesdays and go to a school with a bunch of overachieving, well-dressed brainiacs."
- |
  

- At Old Donation we would sit in circles and solve logic problems.
- |
  

- The worst of it was this, not only did I have to go to this elitist camp once a week, but I also had to do all the make-up work from my regular school.
- |
  

- Call me lazy, but I would have much preferred a regular day of school with my regular subjects, followed by a regular afternoon of riding bikes around the neighborhood with my regular friends.
- |
  

- Yeah, Wednesdays were bad.
- |
  

- First there was the gifted and talented school, then piano lessons with Mrs. Laundry, and then gobs of homework from all my missed assignments.
- So, back to mom's  friend  Marvin.
- |
  

- I remember Ben, mom, Marvin, and I all standing in the main hallway of our house.
- |
  

- The room with the chandelier that had lots of little glass shards hanging from it.
- |
  

- Light reflected through its prisms shining across the walls and staircase and next door into the living room with the blue carpet.
- |
  

- Marvin was going to South Carolina for the weekend and asked if we needed anything.
- |
  

- Yeah.
- |
  

- Fireworks and lots of them , was what instantly came to our minds.
- |
  

- This is all we needed.
- |
  

- This was all we asked for.
- |
  

- Fireworks were illegal in Virginia and most of North Carolina.
- |
  

- But enter South Carolina, and the kiosks began to line up along the highway.
- |
  

- Explosives of all shapes and varieties strung across the open shelves, winking at the passing cars.
- My mom pressed her lips together tightly, cocked her head to the right, and took a deep audible breath through her nose.
- |
  

- She looked at Marvin for an answer.
- |
  

- He looked at her and then turned to us.
- |
  

- He grinned and raised his eyebrows twice.
- |
  

- We were in!
- |
  

- Her lips were still tightly pressed together.
- Ben and I ran up to our rooms at lightening speed and gathered as much money as we could find.
- |
  

- Twenty-eight dollars is what we came up with, rendering it fourteen dollars apiece.
- |
  

- I would eventually pay Ben back his lent seven dollars.
- |
  

- The deal was made and Ben and I impatiently waited.
- Sunday night, Marvin returned.
- |
  

- He handed Ben and I one large grocery store size brown bag.
- |
  

- The weight and size equaled power.
- |
  

- Fire power.
- |
  

- Gun powder.
- |
  

- Detailed Chinese craft and labor.
- |
  

- In one breath, we jumped up and down, thanked him, and eagerly ran upstairs to Ben's bedroom and started sorting.
- |
  

- It was a classic  one for me, one for you  method of distribution that involved bricks of firecrackers, sparklers, lady fingers, jumpin' jacks, bottle rockets, M60s, M70s, M80s, tanks, whistlers, and pinwheels.
- |
  

- I ran and got a drawer from my dresser and dumped the contents onto the floor of my bedroom.
- |
  

- Returning to Ben's room, we put half in my newly emptied drawer and the other half in a cardboard box.
- |
  

- When the work was done, Ben and I stood up and marveled at the display that lay in front of us.
- |
  

- We had plans.
- |
  

- Big plans!
- |
  

- An order to when and where items would be lit.
- |
  

- The ceremonies would begin next weekend.
- |
  

- First we would have to tough out a week of school.
- |
  

- The waiting would be grueling, but well worth the pain.
- The story now moves to Wednesday.
- |
  

- As I said, Wednesday was a bad day.
- |
  

- I had become well versed in the art of faking illness to avoid Old Donation Gifted and Talented school.
- |
  

- Unfortunately, I had already skipped the last two weeks.
- |
  

- Three in a row would seem far too suspicious.
- |
  

- I sucked it up and got out of bed that morning.
- |
  

- School went.
- |
  

- It went uneventfully and miserably.
- |
  

- The logic problems went.
- |
  

- The special interest units went.
- |
  

- The research for our semester contract presentation went.
- |
  

- Then I came home.
- |
  

- Piano lessons went.
- |
  

- The bike ride to Mrs. Laundry's house, the Mel Bay vol.
- |
  

- I had been working on, and the bike ride back home all went.
- |
  

- Then dinner came and went.
- |
  

- Chicken Divan.
- |
  

- A casserole combination of broccoli, chicken pieces, and cream of mushroom soup mix.
- |
  

- It all went.
- That evening, my uncle came into town for some business and met up with my mother.
- |
  

- A baby sitter by the name of Theresa MacGilveray was installed, and my mom and her brother left for the evening.
- |
  

- Theresa took to the phone in the kitchen and began her evening of boyfriend/girlfriend conversations.
- |
  

- I took to my room to begin the piles of make-up homework in the areas of English, social studies, reading, and math.
- |
  

- Ben took to his room.
- |
  

- That's all I know.
