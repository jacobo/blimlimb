- Once upon a time in a land far, far away there lived a young woman so beautiful that all the other women felt like slapping her, or at least saying mean things about her personality.
- |
  

- But they didn't.
- |
  

- They just bit their tongues so hard that when they finally had to open their mouths to eat, the menfolk could see that their teeth were all bloody.
- |
  

- The beautiful young woman's perfect teeth looked really white by comparison.
- Once upon a time this peasant woman gave birth to a child the size of a thumb.
- |
  

- Back then, people needed lots of children because there was so much farmwork to do.
- |
  

- Today, we'd call such a thing a miscarriage.
- Once upon a time there was this queen who used to talk to her mirror all the time.
- |
  

- At least, that's who she said she was talking to.
- |
  

- Whenever she did this, her ladies-in-waiting would roll their eyes.
- |
  

- I actually feel quite sorry for the queen, who had a difficult second marriage and, as a result, a lot of blended family type issues.
- Once upon a time there lived a farmer who had three sons.
- |
  

- The two older sons had dibs on everything, so the youngest son, who was the cleverest and best-looking one anyway, went off and won some kind of contest put on by the king.
- |
  

- He made a great deal of money and got to sleep with a lot of women.
- |
  

- But he died young.
- |
  

- The two older sons had been quite bitter about their younger brother's success and felt vindicated in the end, despite the fact that things had been totally unfair&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;and in their favor&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;from the very beginning.
- |
  

- Except for the genetics.
- Once upon a time a woman had two daughters&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;one beautiful and hardworking, the other ugly and lazy.
- |
  

- Inexplicably, the woman loved her ugly and lazy daughter more.
- |
  

- I really like this woman.
- Once upon a time a well-behaved servant girl with small attractive feet married a prince with no outstanding qualities.
- |
  

- The prince was unbelievably wealthy, though.
- |
  

- Anyway, after they married, the two of them lived happily ever after.
- |
  

- Which is really boring, and the reason people didn't talk about them much after that.
- |
  

- They just watched them all the time, with dark eyes, waiting for something bad to happen.
