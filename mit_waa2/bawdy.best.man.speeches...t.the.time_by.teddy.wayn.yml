- Bill Stanley will actually commit to a woman!

- I've known Bill for 20 years through the NAACP, and he's been fully dedicated to equality for all people, colored or white, rich or poor, female or female!

- I remember the day Bill met Kathleen he said, "Marty, I think I may have found 'the one.

- "\" I said, \""
- You mean the one for Tuesday?
- "\" Seriously, though, when he told me he'd gotten a taste for white sugar, I said, \""

- "Just kidding, it's a wedding, go to town\x97the vegetable biryani is especially delectable."
- |
  

- So, let's talk about Paresh and what he's been hiding under his turban!
- |
  

- Uh-oh, Paresh is turning red!
- |
  

- Oh, that's from the vindaloo.
- |
  

- Someone fetch this man a mango lassi!
- |
  

- When I found out Paresh's marriage to Mausumi was being arranged, I said to Paresh, "This is either fortunate or unfortunate news.
- |
  

- Mausumi' can mean 'beauty,' in which case I am happy for you, my friend, or, of course, it can denote 'monsoon wind,' which portends ominously, as her innocent beauty now may later turn into passive-aggressive resistance.
- "\" Wise Paresh replied, \""
- My dear Mohandas, you are a hookah-is-half-empty kind of guy.
- |
  

- "Mausumi is indeed a beauty\x97but she is also a veritable monsoon wind between the sheets!"
- "\" Whoops\x97sorry, Paresh!"
- |
  

- I hope this news does not upset the Vajpayees!
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- The wedding is now called off and the dowry is to be returned?
- |
  

- Man .

- "C'mon, guys, it's a joke\x97but, off the record, I'm staying in a manger just outside the village, third stall from the left."
- |
  

- When my best friend told me he was marrying my ex, I had two reactions.
- |
  

- "First, I was happy Luke was finally settling down after years of wandering around and spreading my word\x97and a few legs in the process!"
- |
  

- Calm down, calm down.
- |
  

- Second, the poor sap has  no idea  what he's getting into!
- |
  

- OK, so I knew Mary was a bit clingy, but I could never really forgive her for her, ahem, past sins.
- |
  

- "Still, if anyone can handle Mags, it's Luke\x97he's a better man than I. Well, that's not true, but he's a pretty good guy."

- "So I said to him, \"You may have my blessings\x97and my earplugs, 'cause she's a  talker !"
