- Mr. Riley,
- I am writing in regard to your fine Patriot missile defense system.
- |
  

- Of course, we all saw the Patriot's crackerjack performance in the Middle East on TV, but certain developments recently have given me &#8212; and some of my like-minded fellow citizens &#8212; pause to reflect on the advantages of such a system for home use.
- I'm sure you consider yourself a patriot, like I do, in the original sense of the word, and if you've ever tuned your Marine Band to 3,760 megacycles, just before sunrise, then you know what I'm talking about.
- |
  

- Being a patriot today means a little more than dry runs through the national forest, if you catch my drift.
- So, I don't need to tell you what's massing in Haiti or what they've got parked off the Baja peninsula &#8212; the real source of what they call El Ni&ntilde;o.
- |
  

- You can understand the source of our concern.
- |
  

- That is why we have come to consider the service of your fine defense system.
- |
  

- We know your product is pricey, but how can you put a tag on freedom.
- |
  

- "Accordingly, I ask that you send me a color brochure on your latest product line and perhaps answer a few questions:    Does the system work well in urban areas?"
- |
  

- Could the system fit, say, in a panel van?
- |
  

- Will the system work by remote control, and if so, Mac or PC format?
- |
  

- Is it wired for 110 or 220?
- In addition, please let us know when would be a good time to come to the proving grounds for the demonstration.
- I await your reply, sir, and will maintain a "holding pattern" on our progress toward freedom until I hear from you. Enclosed is a check for three dollars to cover the catalog postage. Is there any way you could include a Patriot bumper sticker? I'd sure like that. Until then, as the Bible says, "Before the final flash are true men turned.
- Your fellow citizen,
- Adam Johnson
