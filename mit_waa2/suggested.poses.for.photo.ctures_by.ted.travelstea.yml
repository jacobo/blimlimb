- Smoking a cigarette nonchalantly by the pool while half-listening to an eager interviewer
- |
  

- Sweating profusely, cheap black hair dye running from your graying temples, as you desperately plead for a walk-on role in a C-movie about a ghost clown so you can afford one more week in a seedy North Hollywood motel
- |
  

- You are a child again, running free in a field of swaying grass, not a care in the world
- |
  

- Cradling a huge and garishly colored snow cone at the neighborhood pool's snack bar, your tongue a multiflavored rainbow-hued palette
- |
  

- Clutching your aching stomach and flipping the light switch on and off continuously while trying not to think of your parents' impending divorce
- |
  

- Standing on the pitcher's mound, glove and ball to chest, coolly staring down the league's MVP
- |
  

- Riding high, on the shoulders of your teammates, after pitching your third no-hitter
- |
  

- Sitting next to your walker, under a state-fair tent, shoulder throbbing like the dickens, signing "souvenir game balls" for $4 a pop
- |
  

- Sword held high, standing your ground against a ferocious lava-drooling dragon
- |
  

- Hoisting the dragon's head triumphantly skyward, as the just-saved princess clutches your armor-clad legs
- |
  

- Shaking the family dachshund upside down so it doesn't choke on your 12-sided die that it just gobbled up
- |
  

- Fedora cocked rakishly, .
- |
  

- You pour her a shot of rye to soothe her frayed nerves, and top off your third double of the day, as she dishes out her tale of woe
- |
  

- "\"It's not fair!"
- "\" you cry out in a high-pitched voice as the judge sentences you to a six-month stint for unlawful possession of a firearm and impersonating an officer of the law"
