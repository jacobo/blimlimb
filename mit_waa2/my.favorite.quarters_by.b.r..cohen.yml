- Kentucky
- The composition on this one is superb.

- The framing came out just right.
- |
  

- Exquisite clarity in the fence line, with the dimensionality receding to the right along the proper perspective.
- |
  

- The equine details are outstanding, as flared nostrils exude confidence while the arched neck matches a perfect French curve.
- |
  

- The quarter is set in deep focus &#8212; the mansion in the background is as clear as the withers on the thoroughbred.

- Massachusetts
- Curiously, there is no reference to Fenway Park on these two bits.
- |
  

- Decisions, decisions, we presume, and alas, the fabled Minuteman of Paul Revere's and the Adams clan's Massachusetts takes center stage.
- |
  

- Doubling as a decontextualized geography primer, this quarter also sports a spot-on map of the state.

- The Minuteman, with musket slung across shoulder, hat askew and likely holding a pint, stands about 5 foot 10, covering up the mid-to-west central portion of the state.

- Although his feet stomp on Connecticut, and his hat could spill into Vermont, there is no mention of the dutiful New England neighbors.
- |
  

- No, this one is all Massachusetts.
- |
  

- The Bay State, they call it, and Cape Cod is prominent to the east, defining the very self-same Bay that gives the Commonwealth its nickname.

- Vermont
- They have this tree on it and then there's a bucket and it's on the tree and the bucket collects maple syrup.
- |
  

- I think that's the berries, that idea for a quarter.
- |
  

- Because who doesn't love pancakes?
- |
  

- Plus, they have the branches and all on the tree, it's autumn, and it comes out really clearly.
- |
  

- There's even a syrup-collector guy there.
- |
  

- They did a really good job.
- |
  

- I think Vermont, and the people of Vermont, and those with any institutional ties to those within the state of Vermont should all give themselves a pat on the back.
- |
  

- Connecticut
- This one has a really huge tree on it.
- |
  

- The whole scene is basically the tree.
- |
  

- It's not at all like the Vermont tree, because it is full, lush, with broad leafy leaves.
- |
  

- I know leaves are, by definition, leafy, but I point out the leafiness of these leaves just to say that the tree on this particular quarter is particularly leafy.
- |
  

- I don't know a synonym.
- |
  

- Maryland
- I actually forget the details of this one, except that I remember that it's really great.
- |
  

- It is a fine quarter.
- |
  

- I am from Maryland, originally.
- |
  

- Well, by originally I mean I moved there while still a child and I like the Orioles.
- |
  

- They need middle relief.
- |
  

- And starting pitching.
- |
  

- I used to think they'd be good forever, until they actually began to suck forever.
- |
  

- Georgia
- I don't have one of these.
- |
  

- I bet it has at least one peach on it though.
- |
  

- My wife is a Braves fan.
- |
  

- Virginia
- Everybody, except my wife, loves tall ships like those on this Jamestown-ish quarter.
- |
  

- She also dislikes the Orioles.
- |
  

- She wanted me to add above that they need hitting too.
- |
  

- I said that adding "they need hitting too" was overkill, but no, she said I really should. I said forget it, because this isn't about the hitting. She said well of course it's not, but you're the wisecracker here. Things haven't been good for us recently.

- Ohio
- It's probably not fair to the western states that most of the best quarters are from the original colonies.
- |
  

- But they got here first, so they get the quarter first.
- |
  

- That's why I don't so much disdain Ohio for their pathetic quarter.
- |
  

- I pity them.

- Moo-ha-ha-ha
- My sister and I made this state up when we lived in Maryland.
- |
  

- We said it was bounded by the borders of our yard.
- |
  

- It was her idea, the imaginary state.
- |
  

- Even though she is five years younger than me her emotional age always surpassed mine.

- Our quarter would have an ancient Japanese gingko tree.

- And below it, it would say "Go away!

- Nebraska and California
- I think it would be great if they mixed these up at the mint, and California got a "Corn" motif while Nebraska instead ended up with "Porn.
