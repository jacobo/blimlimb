- Suddenly there was a creak coming from the glass and a bit of glass smashed on the bed and hurt someone and they heard something coming from up in the sky and it was a flying sofa and a flying saucepan over the house.

- I wish there was no one to tell you what to do.
- I wish there was stunt bikes for younger children.
- I wish there were no wars.
- I wish there were no illness.
- I wish there was more medicine.
- I wish there was something to bring people back to life.
- I wish there was something to make you not sad.
- I wish there was no diseases in the world.
- I wish there was no fighting ever in the world.
- I wish everyone was happy.
