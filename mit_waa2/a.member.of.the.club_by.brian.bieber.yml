- Dear Brian Bieber,
- As of this mailing&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;over one year since your initial invoice was sent&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;we at the Columbia House Compact Disc Club have not received payment for your 2-11-98 order.
- |
  

- We value you as a customer, but in order to remain a Columbia House member, we must insist that you take responsibility for your order and send payment immediately.
- Carl Erdrich,
- |
  

- Dear Brian Bieber,
- Thank you for your swift reply to our notice of 4-28-99.
- |
  

- We appreciate your apology concerning your overdue account.
- |
  

- However, it seems that in your apparent urgency to respond, you forgot to include payment with your (surprisingly lengthy) letter.
- Please rectify this situation by sending payment for your account balance in full immediately.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Brian Bieber,
- I was disappointed to read in your latest letter that you consciously chose not to send payment with your letter of 4-30-99.
- I would assume that you, as an American adult, understand the fundamental principles of a market economy.
- |
  

- You see, Mr. Bieber, in our society, goods and/or services are exchanged for currency.
- |
  

- Put plainly, YOU MUST PAY FOR THE SELECTIONS YOU HAVE ORDERED FROM OUR COMPANY.
- |
  

- If payment is not received immediately, we will be forced to seek collection on your account, and your membership in the Columbia House Compact Disc Club will be cancelled.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Dear Brian Bieber,
- I have just received your formal letter of resignation from the Columbia House Compact Disc Club, and let me assure you, we at Columbia House gladly accept.
- |
  

- However, I feel that I should mention that this in no way relieves you of your financial obligations to our company.
- Despite your hopes that your latest letter should "make everything square" between yourself and Columbia House, believe me when I say it does not. Things will not be "square" with us, Mr. Bieber, until we receive IMMEDIATE AND FULL PAYMENT for your order.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Mr. Bieber,
- Normally, we at Columbia House would encourage an open dialogue with our customers, but in your case such a dialogue has been completely unproductive.
- |
  

- You obviously are either unaware (which I sincerely doubt) or apathetic (which I believe to be the case) regarding the commitment you made when agreeing to the terms and conditions of the club.
- |
  

- It has become apparent that you are simply taking advantage of the great savings and benefits extended to members.
- I will not beg you to pay your bill, Mr. Bieber.
- I do, however, wish to express my regret that you have chosen to sully your relationship with Columbia House.
- Pay now, Mr. Bieber.
- |
  

- PAY NOW.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Dear Mr. Bieber,
- "It seems that you misunderstood the context in which the word \"relationship\" was used in my last letter. But to answer your question: No, you and Columbia House cannot \"just be friends."
- Friends, Mr. Bieber, treat each other fairly.
- "Now, I'm going to be honest with you: I'm tired."
- |
  

- Expect no further correspondence from me, Mr. Bieber.
- |
  

- From now on, your account will be the responsibility of the North Shore Collections Agency.
- |
  

- I wish I could say that it has been a pleasure being in touch with you.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Dear Mr. Bieber,
- I'm not sure exactly what to say.
- |
  

- I suppose that in a strange, misguided way, you are correct when you assert that we "got off on the wrong foot," but I thought that I made it crystal clear to you that our correspondence was finished. In spite of this, you still insist on sending me letter after letter.
- "Let me restate myself: Unless you wish to pay the balance of your account in full, please stop your correspondence."
- |
  

- You and I are not friends.
- |
  

- Your account standing is now a matter that concerns only you and the North Shore Collections Agency.
- Please, Mr. Bieber, cease and desist your correspondence.
- Thank you.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Mr. Bieber,
- Concerning your latest letter and the enclosed letters of reference, I'm sure that you do have "plenty of friends as it is.
- "\" I am also duly impressed by the fact that you are in a local rock band, though I'm not exactly sure what bearing that has on this issue or why you brought it up."
- Please, Mr. Bieber.
- |
  

- I'm a busy man and have little time for nonsensical, convoluted letters from persons like yourself.
- Thank you.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Mr. Bieber,
- This is to acknowledge receipt of the demo tape you sent last week.
- |
  

- To answer your question, even if it were within my power, no, I would not "shop it around" for you. Please stop writing me. Please.
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Mr. Bieber,
- After registering a complaint with North Shore Collections Agency concerning your account's continued delinquency, I was informed that you settled your account with them over fourteen months ago.
- I am at a loss, Mr. Bieber.
- |
  

- Why do you still insist on sending me two to three letters a week?
- |
  

- I have never done anything to deserve such bizarre attention.
- |
  

- Your behavior is, at best, inappropriate; at worst, psychotic.
- |
  

- "Please, I beg you: Leave me alone!"
- Sincerely,
- Carl Erdrich
- |
  

- Dear Carl,
- You have no idea how disappointed I was when my last letter to you was sent back unopened and stamped, "Return to sender.
- "\" I really thought that we were starting to hit it off."
- Anyway, my disappointment in your sudden about-face was quickly curbed by an exciting piece of mail that came with your returned letter.
- |
  

- It seems, Carl, that I am one of a select few individuals eligible for great savings from Columbia House.
- I've been waiting for such an offer for quite some time now.
- Your Preferred Customer,
- Brian Bieber
