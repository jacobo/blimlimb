- This stuff is great!
- |
  

- I'm 26!
- |
  

- I always ignored it, thinking, "Why start a bad habit?
- "\" This is a terrific habit!"
- |
  

- I get more done in an hour than I used to get done in a week.
- |
  

- Coffee!
- |
  

- I bought a coffeemaker.
- |
  

- It makes the coffee for me in the morning!
- |
  

- I open my eyes and it's there!
- |
  

- I can see!
- |
  

- The difference between tea and coffee is like a merry-go-round to a rocket ship!
- |
  

- I like rocket ships!
- |
  

- Coffee!
- |
  

- I want to go on a real rocket ship.
- |
  

- Where are they?
- |
  

- Cape Canaveral?
- |
  

- Let's go!
- |
  

- Coffee helps my creativity.
- |
  

- I can come up with something creative out of nowhere.
- |
  

- "\"Larry laughs like a lavicious lunatic!"
- "\" See!"
- |
  

- That was instantaneous!
- |
  

- What does "
- |
  

- "\" mean, you ask?"
- |
  

- I made it up.
- |
  

- Doesn't matter!
- |
  

- Coffee!
- |
  

- I'm going to make it a real word!
- |
  

- It means  scathingly menacing .
- |
  

- Use it!
- |
  

- Hey, I should try improvisational theater!
- |
  

- I'd probably be a riot on coffee.
- |
  

- Yes and .
- |
  

- Sign me up!
- |
  

- Why didn't I drink this stuff in elementary school?
- |
  

- I would have had straight A's.
- |
  

- I could have taught the classes.
- |
  

- Move over, Mr. Starchpants!
- |
  

- "Take a note: I'm going to teach a class!"
- |
  

- Wow!
- |
  

- French vanilla!
- |
  

- What's that like?
- |
  

- Sounds delicious!
- |
  

- Get me some.
- |
  

- Cream and sugar?
- |
  

- I don't need it.
- |
  

- I ask girls to meet me for a cup of coffee.
- |
  

- I talk the whole time!
- |
  

- I used to be so shy!
- |
  

- Sex!
- |
  

- Yesterday, I called the bank to complain about fees!
- |
  

- They gave me a refund!
- |
  

- I can complain now.
- |
  

- What's smoking like?
- |
  

- Does it really relieve stress?
- |
  

- I'm thinking about getting addicted to cigarettes!
- |
  

- I'm going to buy the patch and work my way up!
- |
  

- Now I see why all these things are so popular.
- |
  

- I'm totally serious.
- |
  

- This isn't satire.
- |
  

- I have a lot of catching up to do!
- |
  

- I wonder where I would be today if I had started drinking coffee earlier?
- |
  

- It doesn't matter, I live in the now, now!
- |
  

- I have to shit!
- |
  

- Maybe I would have invented the Internet!
- |
  

- No way!
- |
  

- You think?
- |
  

- I used to think about how we could talk to each other on computers before we actually did.
- |
  

- But that's the difference.
- |
  

- I used to only think about things.
- |
  

- Now I do them!
- |
  

- I better get to work on my retainatherm before someone else beats me to it!
- |
  

- Retainatherm&#8212;think refrigerator except it keeps foods at the same constant temperature they went in with.
- |
  

- Warm stays warm!
- |
  

- Cold remains cold!
- |
  

- Put a hot pizza in there and it stays hot!
- |
  

- All at the same time!
- |
  

- Retain-a-therm!
- |
  

- Iced coffee!
- |
  

- Haven't had that yet.
- |
  

- I can't even imagine!
- |
  

- You could drink it in the summer!
- |
  

- Volleyball!
- |
  

- There's a shooting pain under my left ribs.
- |
  

- It's gone!
- |
  

- Folgers crystals.
