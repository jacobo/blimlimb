- This is Mitch, please leave a message and I'll return your call.
- Yo, Mitch.
- |
  

- It's me.
- |
  

- Trying to track you down.
- |
  

- Corky and Donovan and Alf and me are going to Shorty's, so meet us there after work if you feel like a few beers and some wings.
- |
  

- Or, whatever.
- |
  

- Bah.
- Hey, Mitch.
- |
  

- This is Andrea.
- |
  

- Could you give me a call?
- |
  

- I'm still at the office.
- |
  

- I will probably be here for a while.
- |
  

- Talk to you soon, okay?
- |
  

- Bye.
- This is a message for Mr. Mitchell Burnett from Chuck's Video.
- |
  

- National Velvet  is back in.
- |
  

- I'll hold it until seven-thirty pm.
- Ugh.
- |
  

- Hello, Mitch.
- |
  

- It's Kathleen.
- |
  

- I'm calling your cell because there's no answer at work.
- |
  

- No answer &#151; like, the front desk is just ringing and ringing.
- |
  

- Anyhow, I think we should have dinner sometime.
- |
  

- And no, I don't think it's a bad idea.
- |
  

- We're grownups.
- |
  

- I think.
- |
  

- And we can get through this.
- |
  

- I'm hopping in the tub and going out for Thai food with Angelique.
- |
  

- Edward gave me his tickets to see  Annie Get Your Gun  and I may go to the Mayflower Grill this weekend with Rachel or Alfonse.
- |
  

- My dad's doing okay, by the way, and Tommy is not going to court after all.
- |
  

- Like you care.
- |
  

- I still love you, Mitch.
- |
  

- Even though.
- |
  

- Bye-bye.
- Hi, Mitch.
- |
  

- It's Eddie.
- |
  

- Have you ever seen  The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari ?
- |
  

- Well, you look just like Dr. Caligari.
- |
  

- It's a good thing!
- |
  

- They played it last night at the Castro right after  Eraserhead  for some reason.
- |
  

- Random!
- |
  

- Anyway, I need my copy of  The Tibetan Book of the Dead  back.
- |
  

- I need it because my class is starting in 10 days and we're supposed to have read the first couple chapters by then.
- |
  

- So, I need it.
- |
  

- I'm at home.
- |
  

- Later.
- Hello.
- |
  

- This is a message for Mr. Mitchell Burnett.
- |
  

- My name is Gregory Bolton, and I am Assistant Regional Manager for the California State Lottery Office.
- |
  

- I am calling in reference to the message you left with my assistant regarding the lottery ticket purchased at .
- |
  

- East Avenue Grocery on Divisadero.
- |
  

- I am still gathering data and I need you to either bring the ticket to the lottery office at your earliest convenience or fax me a copy of the front and back of the ticket.
- |
  

- Thank you and I look forward to hearing back.
- Greetings.
- |
  

- It's Nick.
- |
  

- Did I ever tell you I hate my breasts?
- |
  

- I've been working out like crazy and my arms and abs are how I want them, but my chest is so damn skinny.
- |
  

- I'm thinking of getting implants since the steroids aren't working.
- |
  

- Little implants, nothing to worry about.
- |
  

- They won't turn to fat, which is the thing.
- |
  

- I have to meet Rita seven-ish.
- |
  

- So, don't be late tonight.
- |
  

- Ciao bello.
- Ugh.
- |
  

- Kathleen again.
- |
  

- I'm standing here in my closet, surrounded by all these outfits, wondering why I bought half of them, yet unable to let them out of my life.
- |
  

- It may sound completely superficial, but I think a lot of superficial things ring true after a while.
- |
  

- Do you miss me?
- |
  

- I have to say, this is very hard.
- |
  

- I know it's my fault.
- |
  

- I brought it on myself, on us.
- |
  

- It's just that I realized there's been only one day since I was 14 when I didn't have a boyfriend.
- |
  

- I feel like something's going to happen any day now.
- |
  

- Something .
- |
  

- I hate that feeling.
- |
  

- So, guess what I'm going to do?
- |
  

- I'm dedicating my new philosophy to you.
- |
  

- "Here it is: From now on, I'm getting exactly what I want out of life."
- |
  

- I have lived way too long in my own shadow.
- |
  

- Remember a while back when you threw me that little birthday party?
- |
  

- Did I ever tell you that while you and Angelique were dancing to "Crystal Blue Persuasion" I felt this burning desire to grab the cheese knife, slip out of the wheelchair, crawl over and sever your Achilles tendons? Am I evil? We all have our reasons for doing what we do. But, it's a new day and a new philosophy. Nothing will stop me from getting what I want. Okay? Okay. I think I've found a top that looks good. It's small, green, sassy. It'll go great with my new pleather pants. Ugh, I'm blabbering. Hanging up now. Bye.
- Shazaam!
- |
  

- Where the hell are you, Dipstick?
- |
  

- We've got a table at Shorty's &#151; finally!
- |
  

- Donovan is telling us about this outrageous chick he met on that cruise to Alaska.
- |
  

- It's a good story.
- |
  

- She jumped off the ship and had to get helicoptered out of there.
- |
  

- He found her in Fairbanks doing tarot in a coffee shop.
- |
  

- They're engaged, dude!
- |
  

- Get your ass over here.
- |
  

- Dollar drafts end in .
- |
  

- Bah.
- Listen, it's Andrea again.
- |
  

- I'm still at the office.
- |
  

- I'll be here for another half-hour or so, until the cleaning crew finishes around your workstation.
- |
  

- I did what I could with Victoria and Steve, but I think security has already been notified.
- |
  

- You may be getting a call from someone.
- |
  

- "Do me a favor: Don't come back to the office, please."
- |
  

- It's not a good time.
- |
  

- Okay?
- |
  

- Call soon.
- Mitch.
- |
  

- Eddie.
- |
  

- Oh my God.
- |
  

- I just saw you on TV.
- |
  

- Call me.
- |
  

- A.S.
- A.
- P.
- Mitchell, this is your mother.
- |
  

- Your father and I have been talking seriously about something.
- |
  

- We'd like to discuss Kathleen.
- |
  

- Let me just say that I believe I raised you irreproachably.
- |
  

- I never showered you with love, nor did I ever take too firm a stance.
- |
  

- I gave you your privacy and allowed you to make your share of ludicrous decisions.
- |
  

- We have all done that.
- |
  

- Even your father.
- |
  

- Nevertheless, he and I cannot stand back and allow you to marry this woman.
- |
  

- I am pleased that you cared for her after her predicament.
- |
  

- I respect the financial support you gave her.
- |
  

- I think it was commendable of you to skydive with her after her recovery, despite our misgivings.
- |
  

- But you are still a young man, Mitchell.
- |
  

- And, believe me, I know what this Kathleen person is up to.
- |
  

- It didn't take me but a few days to see that she's using you to get to your father.
- |
  

- I saw the way she looked at him.
- |
  

- Your father is still an extremely handsome man, and I've spent a good deal of my life batting away the harlots.
- |
  

- The way she commented on his home office, his bookshelf, the inane comments on Heidegger &#151; as if she could possibly make conversation with him on the subject.
- |
  

- Her choice of outfits was absolutely insulting.
- |
  

- Did you tell her we had a pool?
- |
  

- If not, I have no idea why she would wear such a thing around the house.
- |
  

- Your father agrees.
- |
  

- He, like I, think you should postpone or outright cancel any kind of conjugal agreement you have with Kathleen.
- |
  

- Tell her you need time to think, and gradually avoid her.
- |
  

- I hope you are having a nice week.
- |
  

- Please come up and see us this weekend if you can.
- |
  

- Have a good evening.
- It's Nick again.
- |
  

- Did I ever tell you what happens when I'm washing this particular frying pan of mine?
- |
  

- I'll be scrubbing the inside with detergent, my mind blank.
- |
  

- When I turn the pan over, the image of this same woman comes to me.
- |
  

- It's uncanny.
- |
  

- She used to work at the Earth Tones Grocery.
- |
  

- When I first started seeing her there I totally avoided eye contact, because that just doesn't work.
- |
  

- Not in retail.
- |
  

- After a few visits, I realized that she was avoiding eye contact with me.
- |
  

- I started trying eye contact again, but she wouldn't look at me.
- |
  

- She dragged all my things across the scanner, tapped out the fruit and vegetable codes without missing a beat, sorted all my items by cold and perishable, dry and wet, bulky and soft.
- |
  

- I'm not in love or anything, but it's been six months or so since she quit working at Earth Tones and for some reason I think about her every time I wash the back of my non-stick frying pan.
- |
  

- Hound Dog, you are really good at this kind of thing.
- |
  

- Let me just ask you, why the hell does this shit always happen?
- |
  

- See you at the club.
- |
  

- Don't be late.
- Holy Shit, Mitch.
- |
  

- It's Anthony.
- |
  

- Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just body-slam Steve Dickson?
- |
  

- Did you just reach between his legs and around his shoulders and lift him over your head and body-slam his ass?
- |
  

- I'm sorry, but I have to be sure.
- |
  

- Did you take off your belt and whip his hide up and down Main Street?
- |
  

- I thought so.
- |
  

- Man!
- |
  

- I've never seen Andrea's face so red.
- |
  

- We've got to talk.
- |
  

- I have this feeling that I'm not going to be seeing you around the office any time soon.
- |
  

- Come down to The Twister tonight if you can.
- |
  

- I'll buy you a fruity beverage.
- |
  

- Or maybe you'll buy me one, Daddy Warbucks.
- |
  

- Bye.
- Hey there.
- |
  

- Eddie again.
- |
  

- That was definitely you on the news.
- |
  

- And now I'm wondering where you are.
- |
  

- Listen, I have called a couple of times and I'm going to wait for you to call me.
- |
  

- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- |
  

- See ya.
