  Ahab really lets himself go here, hygiene thrown out the porthole.  He knows 
  life is about to get crazy; he can feel it. While he deviously watches 
  Starbuck climb the mast a bird steals his hat, causing him to reflect on his 
  desires.  He wonders if Starbuck would love him if he passed on finding the 
  whale.
  Chapter 131
  The Pequod Meets The Delight

  in time with a rhythm pounded out on the deck by Daggoo, Queequeg, and 
  Tashtego.  The three harpooners discuss plans for their variety stage show 
  in Boston.  Tashtego is adamant about more straightmen in the troupe.  He
