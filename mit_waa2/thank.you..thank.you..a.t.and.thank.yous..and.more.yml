- Well, we're overwhelmed.
- In the past 10 days, thousands of you have visited, shopped, bid, and bugged your friends to follow suit.

- "From the first morning of the sale, we've been mind-boggled by your response\x97the enthusiasm, the encouragement, the stern commands to persevere."

- We've been sitting in our office all these days, emboldened and so happy, sharing with each other each kind note, each crazy order and new auction item, cheering at the end of each day when we tally up.

- All the support has been inspiring, and also humbling.

- No one's getting rich in this business, but your support can allow these labors of love to labor onward.

- In our last note, we mentioned Millard Kaufman, whose sterling first novel we'll be releasing this fall.

- "We mentioned that the book is called  Bowl of Cherries  and that the author is 90 years old, but there are a few other noteworthy things about Millard that we didn't mention: He served with the U.S."

- Marine Corps on Guadalcanal and Okinawa in World War II.
- |
  

- He is the Oscar-nominated screenwriter of the legendary  Bad Day at Black Rock .
- |
  

- He was awarded a special medal at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair.
- |
  

- "And: He is the co-creator of Mr. Magoo."

- This is true.
- Also, he's a terrific guy, a marvelous writer, and  Bowl of Cherries  is one of the wittiest, most unexpected books we've seen in years, like a more hormonal  Invitation to a Beheading  told by a 15-year-old trapped in Iraq.

- The full novel will be out by October.
- We've got lots more on the way, of course, but for now we mainly want to say thanks.
