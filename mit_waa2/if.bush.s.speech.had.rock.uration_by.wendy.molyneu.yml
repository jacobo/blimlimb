- "Vice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow-citizens, weird little purple elephant guy that I'm hallucinating:"
- On this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the durable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that unite our country.
- |
  

- Giggles .
- |
  

- Sorry, but man, I am totally high right now.
- |
  

- If you are watching this at home, put on some Floyd and spark one, because I'm about to blow your mind.
- I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of the consequential times in which we live, and determined to get a snack when this shit is done.
- |
  

- You know what would be good right now?
- |
  

- Some Cheetos.
- |
  

- Or one of those Sno Balls.
- |
  

- Those little pink Hostess guys?
- |
  

- Does anybody have any snacks with them?
- |
  

- I can eat and talk.
- |
  

- Oh crap, Laura's looking at me with those fire eyes.
- |
  

- C'mon, give me a hug.
- |
  

- No? OK.
- Anyway, at this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use, but by the history we have seen together.
- |
  

- For a half century, America defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders.
- |
  

- "After the shipwreck of Communism came\x97wait, has anybody seen  Hunt for Red October ?"
- |
  

- That is one of my favorite movies.
- |
  

- Where is Sean Connery from, anyway?
- |
  

- I thought he was English but then he's got like this weird accent in his voice.
- |
  

- Did you see  Entrapment ?
- |
  

- I'd like to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in the Oval Office, if you know what I mean.
- |
  

- Crap, Laura's going to make me go back to Promise Keepers.
- |
  

- I just know it.
- "We have seen our vulnerability\x97like last night I figured out that I can't put my hand through a bulletproof window."
- |
  

- Rumsfeld dared me to try, but it's impossible, even on PCP.
- So what am I trying to say here?
- |
  

- I guess I just want the American people to know that I've had a totally awesome time with you guys.
- |
  

- Is it cool if I sit?
- |
  

- The president sits .
- |
  

- Whew!
- |
  

- That's better.
- |
  

- My feet felt weird, like cold and hot at the same time.
- |
  

- Does anybody else hear a gong?
- |
  

- No? OK, Elephant Guy heard it, anybody else hear it?
- |
  

- Anyway, like I was saying, the last four years have been a fucking blast.
- |
  

- Yeah, we had some awkward moments, like when I accidentally said, "Bring it on.
- "\" That was a major party foul."
- |
  

- And I totally kicked the keg as far as the budget goes.
- |
  

- But don't forget all the laughs we had.
- |
  

- Like when I choked on that pretzel, and when I dropped that dog, and remember, oh man, when I was reading that book about that goat.
- |
  

- There are some things you don't want on camera!
- I guess I felt really sad when I thought I might lose the election, because those four years just flew by.
- |
  

- So I'm so fucking psyched that we are all going to hang out for four more years.
- |
  

- So, I guess, you know, I love you guys.
- |
  

- So let's just keep rocking for the next four, OK?
- |
  

- Promise me we'll party, OK?
- |
  

- Cool.
- |
  

- The president stands .
- |
  

- Now I gotta get out of here because I'm meeting my connection on the East Lawn, then we're gonna go look at the fractal posters I put up in the Lincoln bedroom.
- Oh, and I was just kidding about thinking I would lose the election.
- |
  

- My family and I will kill and eat anyone who stands in our way.
- |
  

- Peace!
- |
  

- I'm out.
