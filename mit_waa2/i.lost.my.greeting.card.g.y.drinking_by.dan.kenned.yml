- A mouthful of this earth and clean air to get me out of here.

- In this room, trapped again.

- Not to be trusted.

- I've sighted this bird a dozen times in L.A.

- Barely overeducated, Range Rover-driving, wicked corporate pickpockets tempting me with cash and lunches.

- Those bloody talons, just out of the camera's range.
- |
  

- They ignore you for two decades to make you think they're not looking, but they would swipe film rights from babies and grandmothers if they had the chance.
- |
  

- I'm through with this shit.

- Eagles like this are killing me, man.

- "Front of card:  A green field in late spring plays host to a gaggle of hot-air-balloon enthusiasts."
- |
  

- The balloonists are in various stages of lazy, dreamy flight ranging from just starting off to being all the way at the far horizon.
- "Inside:  \"What do you want from me!"
- |
  

- I'm sick of every single person trying to take, take, take!
- |
  

- And feeling like they know me.
- |
  

- If so many people know me, why am I so lonely!
- |
  

- Who is Mr. Popular having sex with tonight?
- |
  

- Nobody!
- |
  

- Mr. Popular is grinding out copy for cards, for ads, for scripts, because he is addicted to his lifestyle.
- |
  

- He is addicted to trying for something he can't even describe.
- |
  

- He is addicted to hotel Scotch and sitting in a room in Chicago with his laptop.
- |
  

- But what the hell did you ever do?
- |
  

- "Front of card:  An older French gentleman smiles and waves as he walks near the Seine on a beautiful morning."
- |
  

- A pretty woman is passing through the shot on a black-and-gray bicycle.
- |
  

- She's got a baguette tied to the little rack on the back of the bicycle.
- "Inside:  \"Oh, please."
- |
  

- Like this old guy's not just mentally undressing this chick.
- |
  

- Look at the woman!
- |
  

- A stunning portrait of sexual vitality basically taunting the old guy.
- |
  

- There's your sex offender, America.
- |
  

- She should be arrested!
- |
  

- I'm just screwing with your head .
- |
  

- She's cool.
- |
  

- Me, I long for the day I'm free of the urge, like the old French man.
- |
  

- This burn and moan kills you on the road!
- |
  

- Speaking of which, does this hotel have a bar in it?
- |
  

- Because as soon as I  e-mail  these off, I basically got four grand to have some fun with, and I can't be the only living person staying here.
