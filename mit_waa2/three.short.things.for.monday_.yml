- A man was walking along the beach with the Lord.
- |
  

- Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.
- |
  

- For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand.
- Yet he also noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints.

- This always happened at the very lowest times of his life.
- The man questioned the Lord, "Why did you abandon me when I truly needed you?
- And the Lord smiled down on the man, saying, "During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.
- To which the man replied, "No, you can see the little Nike swoosh right there, look closer.
- And the Lord said, "Oh.

- OK, I was floating.
- |
  

- "\"Come to the edge,\""
- |
  

- They said, "We are afraid.
- "\"Come to the edge,\""
- |
  

- They came.
- He pushed them.
- And they pushed back.
- He pushed them again.
- They said, "Stop doing that.
- "\"Whatever,\""
- |
  

- "\"Assholes."
