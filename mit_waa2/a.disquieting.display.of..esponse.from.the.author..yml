- "Date: Fri, 3 Mar 2000"
- "Dear McSweeneys:"
- I've just read Paul Maliszewski's "In Search of the Red Planet" and felt compelled to begin my own search for a globe of Mars. However, I cheated and used the Internet. My search took about 5 minutes before I found my Martian Globe. And the good news is, it's huggable.
- It comes from a company called Hugg-a-Planet, which bills itself as the official planet of the new Millenium (in case you didn't get the Memo), and is called Hugg-a-Planet Mars.
- |
  

- "The description of the product on the Web site is as follows: \"Visit The \"Red Planet\" Mars."
- |
  

- Over 400 places labeled.
- |
  

- Is proportional to Classic Earth.
- |
  

- Comes with a fact sheet of the planet mars.
- |
  

- The most detailed globe of Mars available.
- That final claim seems pretty safe, since, as chronicled by Mr. Maliszewski, the market for Martian globes is as barren as the dry, crater-laden landscape of the Red Planet itself.
- Hugg-a-Planet Mars comes in a box that looks like a combination of a milk carton and a toy rocket.
- |
  

- It may or may not be inflatable--it's kind of hard to tell from the picture.
- |
  

- It costs $14.
- |
  

- Perhaps it is the poetic muse to which David Berman refers.

- "Please, Mr. Maliszewski:"
- Do not fret.
- |
  

- Your quest is at an end.
- |
  

- By dint of the Excite search engine, I have located not one but two globes of Mars.
- |
  

- Both are available for purchase.
- One is small.
- |
  

- Only four-and-three-fourths inches in diameter.
- |
  

- For a globe, that strikes me as very small.
- |
  

- Almost silly-small.
- |
  

- I imagine it looks like a jawbreaker.
- |
  

- I bet people are always making that mistake.
- |
  

- I bet these little Mars globes get licked a lot.
- At any rate, these little guys cost $14.
- |
  

- "A globe of Mars of a more conventional size\xD0twelve inches in diameter\xD0can be bought at store."
- |
  

- "Of course, conventional size does not come cheap: these things are $84."
- |
  

- But I guess, as globes go, that isn't wildly steep.
- |
  

- And, according to the site's description of them, NASA had a hand in making the things, so they're probably fairly accurate.
- |
  

- "Here's the site's description:"
- "\"Our 12-inch scale model of the red planet depicts more than 100 identified features as well as the major bright and dark regions visible from Earth."
- |
  

- It was produced by Sky & Telescope [an astronomy magazine] in collaboration with NASA and the U.S.
- |
  

- Geological Survey.

- Dear McSweeney's,
- Paul Maliszewski seems to think that just because he read about a globe of Mars in a poem by Some Poet Guy, he should be able to just run off and _buy_ a globe of Mars at the mall or better yet over the phone with his all-powerful credit card, no doubt.
- What's the matter with him?
- Hasn't he ever heard of poetic license?
- Or maybe some person made a damn globe of Mars with his bare hands, or by coloring on a volleyball with a red magic marker (Mars is round, which shape can be approximated by a volleyball, or a basketball though I think you will find basketballs more difficult to color).
- Maybe you can't BUY everything, Paul.
- It's this sort of immediate gratification impulse, this rage to consume, this insatiable need to own everything one has ever heard of, this irrational exuberance, that keeps our economy going and people happy enough so they don't do something stupid like elect Pat Buchanan President.
- In solidarity,

- "Subject: mars globe"
- I do not wish to take away from the sublime beauty of Mr. Maliszewski's futile search for the non-existent globe of the red planet, but the Carolina Company indeed vends mighty fine renderings of planets other than our own.
- "Taken directly from their on-line catalog, here is their description of the Mars globe:"
- "\"Repogle."
- |
  

- This 12"
- |
  

- Mars at a scale of 1:250,000.
- |
  

- The color of the globe is similar to that of the Martian surface.
- |
  

- The names of the features used are those approved by the International Astronomical Union.
- |
  

- The detail of the Martian features are based on some 6,000 images acquired during the 1970s by NASA's twin Viking orbiters.
- |
  

- The globe sits on a plastic stand and includes a detailed information brochure.
- I have no idea what "Repogle" might mean, but other than that it sounds like a pretty stylin' globe, does it not?And usless you're one of those smartypants astronomers, you might be surprised, as I was, to discover that the globe's surface ("similar to that of the Martian surface") is actually more brown than red.
- Kind of a romantic sepia, really.
- All in all, well worth the $101.
- |
  

- I'd say.
- But wait!
- Put that checkbook away!
- You haven't even heard about the Venus globe yet!
- "\"Explore Venus with this 12\""
- |
  

- Magellan orbitor.
- |
  

- The globe is color coded and all of the major landforms are labeled.
- |
  

- It was produced in cooperation with NASA and the Geological Survey.
- |
  

- As a bonus, "Exploring Venus," a 24-page reprint from the Sky and Telescope publication, is included. The globe is invaluable for investigating faults, craters, lava plains, and "pancake" domes in 3-D.
- |
  

- Includes 2 pairs of 3-D glasses.
- "\"Pancake\""
- |
  

- D glasses!
- A 24-page reprint!
- No "Repogle", but, hey, we shouldn't be greedy.
- Sadly, however, this is where our joy over discovering planets other than our own must come to an end.
- Other than moon globes, the Carolina Company's non-Earth offerings end there.
- I suppose one planet in either direction is as far as we were ever meant to travel.

- I can safely say this because i possest one until december 1998, when it (along wth a library of a myriad volumes & about that many musical pieces, &c, &c) was destroyd by fire.

- I had ownd it since th late seventies or early eighties & i cannot now remember th vendor.
- |
  

- I wld think someone like Edmund Scientific or certain school supply companies might stock it.
- |
  

- Martian globes must not be a common item, for i never met another person wth one during all that time, but if u really desire one i am sure one can be located.
- |
  

- Now, a jovian globe or a globe of any of th other "gaseous giants" may be another matter, due n no small part, i am sure, to th tendency of th surface presented to us to change more quickly than th surfaces of planets of terrestrial type.

- I loved your piece about the search for a Globe of Mars.
- There could be some insight into the failure of a capitalist society to meet the demands of individual consumers through projecting mass trends on to each person.
- But the main reason I liked it is because it's witty.
- After reading, I found a real Mars Globe for auction on eBay.
- Info for the globe is at  [url]
- The globe itself was made by Replogle in 1971, and you can figure out the rest of the info by visiting the site.
- As far as I can tell, no one else makes them today.
- I checked some on-line map and globe shops, and came up with nothing.

- If you feel so inclined, you may inform the author of today's (or possibly yesterday's) piece concerning martian globes that they do, in fact, exist.
- |
  

- I used to work for a store called Natural Wonders, which is one of those nutty-crunchy yuppie-type earth stores much like some of the ones contacted by Mr. Maliszewski.
- |
  

- And they definitely sold them.
- |
  

- At one point.
- |
  

- I can't guarantee that they are still in production or still being sold by that particular establishment, which has several hundred locations nationwide.
- |
  

- But they existed at one point in the not too distant past.
- |
  

- Now I work for a computer store.
- |
  

- It is not quite as interesting as working in a yuppie-type earth store, but the management is more compotent, and I get an extra 15 minute break.
- |
  

- The one advantage to working in Natural Wonders was that it was in a mall.
- |
  

- Normally I despise malls, but there was a Cinnabon two stores over, so I always had good food.
- |
  

- Now I have to drive half a mile to Dunkin Donuts, where the food is not nearly of the quality it is at Cinnabon, although I must admit it is quite a bit less expensive.
- |
  

- Gasoline expenses, however, detract from this potential advantage.
- The second matter I wish to discuss with you is your fourth issue.
- |
  

- Is it forthcoming?
- |
  

- You say February the seventh, yet it is currently March the fifth and I have yet to see it appear in my bookstore (Barnes & Noble, Framingham, Massachusetts).
- |
  

- I understand you missed your boat, and that I am urged to practice patience while waiting for its arrival, but I am growing quite concerned.

  You will not find answers to the following questions:\n\
  1. Why the wide price variety?Did they hear someone was after a Mars globe and jack up the cost?\n\
  2. Since when is Atlantis a planet?\n\
  3. How big is the Planet Earth Globe?\n\
  4. Are there giant spiders on Mars and do they eat men? While the site notes \"Additional styles of\n\

  Description follows:\n\
  Mars Globe\n\
  No planet in our solar system has aroused more curiosity than Mars. Theories about canals, spring\n\
  growth, waves of darkening, and the possibility of life on the red planet has been the basis for many\n\
  tales over the years. American spacecraft have visited the planet six times since 1965 (Mariners 4, 6, 7\n\
  between 1965 and 1969 were fly-by spacecraft; Mariner 9 orbited Mars for 349 days in 1971; Vikings 1\n\
  and 2 orbited and landed on Mars in 1976).\n\
  Components\n\
  1973 edition Mariner 9 Mars globe with base and informational booklet on the planet. Suitable for\n\
  table-top display. Display dimensions - 16\" Dia. X 18\".\n\
  Requirements\n\
  Value for insurance purposes: $160.00. Shipping: 1 crate (20\" x 20\" x 20\"), 10 lbs. Labor/Time: 1\n\
  person/15 minutes.\n\
  There are some rather lengthy requirements for the temporary acquisition of said planet however: from\n\
  (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/pao/exhibits/requirements.html)\n\
  IMPORTANT\n\
  THESE REQUIREMENTS MUST BE READ. They are a part of the Exhibit Application. After\n\
  completion, this page must be attached to the copy retained by the Sponsor.\n\
  REQUIREMENTS\n\
  1.All questions on the Exhibit Application below should be completed. If a question is not applicable, the\n\
  response should state that fact.\n\
  2.NASA exhibits are available for professional, trade, civic, educational, or public service events. Use of\n\
  NASA exhibits must give no unfair commercial advantage. This criterion normally rules out individual\n\
  businesses and advertising uses, but not events that public relations firms organize for public service or\n\
  educational sponsors.\n\
  3.There must be no admission fee charged for a NASA exhibit. Although a NASA exhibit may be part\n\
  of a larger exposition that charges an admission fee, such as a state fair, it may not be the major\n\
  attraction of such an event.\n\
  4.NASA exhibit requests for fund raising events benefiting a single organization or events sponsored by\n\
  religious or political groups, are normally not approved.\n\
  5.The sponsor assumes all shipping expenses to and from the place of exhibition.\n\
  6.The sponsor shall provide suitable labor to unload, uncrate, set up and take down, crate and load\n\
  aboard the common carrier. All other expenses including property insurance, adequate indoor storage of\n\
  empty crates, daily exhibit maintenance, utility hookup, shall be borne by the sponsoring organization.\n\
  7.Title to the NASA exhibit furnished by the Government shall remain in the Government. The sponsor\n\
  shall maintain adequate property control records of the Government-furnished exhibit in accordance\n\
  with sound business practice.\n\
  8.During the period the NASA exhibit is in the custody of the sponsor, the sponsor will pay expenses\n\
  relating to its operation, including maintenance and repair. During this period the sponsor assumes the\n\
  risk of, and is responsible for, any loss of, or damage to, the exhibit except for reasonable wear and tear.\n\
  (The sponsor will contact NASA before effecting any repairs.)\n\
  9.The sponsor assumes responsibility for any liability, damages or injuries to persons or property arising\n\
  out of, or in any way connected with, the sponsor's possession or use of the exhibit(s), and shall hold the\n\
  Government harmless against any claims arising hereunder.\n\
  10.Federal law prohibits any member of, or delegate to the U.S. Congress, or Resident Commissioner,\n\
  from sharing in or benefiting from this agreement.\n\
  11.When necessary, and at the expense of the sponsor, NASA will provide an Exhibits Specialist to\n\
  supervise the uncrating, set-up and take-down of complex exhibits. The sponsor will be notified when it\n\
  is necessary for an Exhibits Specialist to be on site.\n\
  12.Compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, will be required as it applies.\n\
  13.The sponsor may be required to carry insurance covering loss or damage to the exhibit(s), persons,\n\
  or property. The requirement of insurance and the minimum amount (if specified) will be shown in the\n\
  Exhibit Loan Agreement. Insuranceis required for exhibits loaned to state, county, municipal, and city\n\
  entities, including organizations such as educational institutions established by those entities.\n\
  14.All exhibits shall be displayed indoors unless written exception is given. The specific location of\n\
  exhibits will be agreed upon by the sponsor and NASA before the loan agreement is approved. Once\n\
  finalized, approval must be granted by NASA before the exhibit can be moved to another location.\n\
  15.The sponsor shall not assign to another person or entity this agreement or any part of the rights under\n\
  this agreement, except as otherwise agreed to by the United States in writing.\n\

  Date: Fri, 3 Mar 2000\n\
  Dear McSweeneys:\n\
  I've just read Paul Maliszewski's \"In Search of the Red Planet\" and felt compelled to begin my own\n\
  search for a globe of Mars. However, I cheated and used the Internet. My search took about 5 minutes\n\
  before I found my Martian Globe. And the good news is, it's huggable.\n\
  It comes from a company called Hugg-a-Planet, which bills itself as the official planet of the new\n\
  Millenium (in case you didn't get the Memo), and is called Hugg-a-Planet Mars. The description of the\n\
  product on the Web site is as follows: \"Visit The \"Red Planet\" Mars. Over 400 places labeled. Is\n\
  proportional to Classic Earth. Comes with a fact sheet of the planet mars. The most detailed globe of\n\
  Mars available.\"\n\
  That final claim seems pretty safe, since, as chronicled by Mr. Maliszewski, the market for Martian\n\
  globes is as barren as the dry, crater-laden landscape of the Red Planet itself.\n\
  Hugg-a-Planet Mars comes in a box that looks like a combination of a milk carton and a toy rocket. It\n\
  may or may not be inflatable--it's kind of hard to tell from the picture. It costs $14.95 and usually ships\n\
  the next business day.Perhaps it is the poetic muse to which David Berman refers.\n\

  Please, Mr. Maliszewski:\n\
  Do not fret. Your quest is at an end. By dint of the Excite search engine, I have located not one but two\n\
  globes of Mars. Both are available for purchase.\n\
  One is small. Only four-and-three-fourths inches in diameter. For a globe, that strikes me as very small.\n\
  Almost silly-small. I imagine it looks like a jawbreaker. I bet people are always making that mistake. I\n\
  bet these little Mars globes get licked a lot.\n\
  At any rate, these little guys cost $14.95, and can be purchased at www.keepernsol.com/products.html.\n\
  A globe of Mars of a more conventional size\xD0twelve inches in diameter\xD0can be bought at\n\
  store.skypub.com. Of course, conventional size does not come cheap: these things are $84.95 each. But\n\
  I guess, as globes go, that isn't wildly steep. And, according to the site's description of them, NASA had\n\
  a hand in making the things, so they're probably fairly accurate. Here's the site's description:\n\
  \"Our 12-inch scale model of the red planet depicts more than 100 identified features as well as the\n\
  major bright and dark regions visible from Earth. It was produced by Sky & Telescope [an astronomy\n\
  magazine] in collaboration with NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey. Comes with a clear pedestal\n\
  and an information booklet.\"\n\
  I hope this information has restored some of your faith in the blue planet. You can go back to reading\n\

  Dear McSweeney's,\n\
  Paul Maliszewski seems to think that just because he read about a globe of Mars in a poem by Some\n\
  Poet Guy, he should be able to just run off and _buy_ a globe of Mars at the mall or better yet over the\n\
  phone with his all-powerful credit card, no doubt.What's the matter with him?Hasn't he ever heard of\n\
  poetic license?Or maybe some person made a damn globe of Mars with his bare hands, or by coloring\n\
  on a volleyball with a red magic marker (Mars is round, which shape can be approximated by a\n\
  volleyball, or a basketball though I think you will find basketballs more difficult to color).Maybe you can't\n\
  BUY everything, Paul.\n\
  It's this sort of immediate gratification impulse, this rage to consume, this insatiable need to own\n\
  everything one has ever heard of, this irrational exuberance, that keeps our economy going and people\n\

  I do not wish to take away from the sublime beauty of Mr. Maliszewski's futile search for the\n\
  non-existent globe of the red planet, but the Carolina Company indeed vends mighty fine renderings of\n\
  planets other than our own.Taken directly from their on-line catalog, here is their description of the\n\
  Mars globe:\n\
  \"Repogle. This 12\"-diameter globe portrays Mars at a scale of 1:250,000. The color of the globe is\n\
  similar to that of the Martian surface. The names of the features used are those approved by the\n\
  International Astronomical Union. The detail of the Martian features are based on some 6,000 images\n\
  acquired during the 1970s by NASA's twin Viking orbiters. The globe sits on a plastic stand and\n\
  includes a detailed information brochure.\"\n\
  I have no idea what \"Repogle\" might mean, but other than that it sounds like a pretty stylin' globe, does it\n\
  not?And usless you're one of those smartypants astronomers, you might be surprised, as I was, to\n\
  discover that the globe's surface (\"similar to that of the Martian surface\") is actually more brown than\n\
  red.Kind of a romantic sepia, really.All in all, well worth the $101.95 price tag, I'd say.\n\
  But wait!Put that checkbook away!You haven't even heard about the Venus globe yet!\n\
  \"Explore Venus with this 12\" globe that has been designed using radar data from the Magellan orbitor.\n\
  The globe is color coded and all of the major landforms are labeled. It was produced in cooperation with\n\
  NASA and the Geological Survey. As a bonus, \"Exploring Venus,\" a 24-page reprint from the Sky and\n\
  Telescope publication, is included. The globe is invaluable for investigating faults, craters, lava plains,\n\
  and \"pancake\" domes in 3-D. Includes 2 pairs of 3-D glasses.\"\n\
  \"Pancake\" domes!3-D glasses!A 24-page reprint!No \"Repogle\", but, hey, we shouldn't be greedy.\n\
  Sadly, however, this is where our joy over discovering planets other than our own must come to an\n\
  end.Other than moon globes, the Carolina Company's non-Earth offerings end there.I suppose one\n\
  planet in either direction is as far as we were ever meant to travel.\n\

  If you feel so inclined, you may inform the author of today's (or possibly yesterday's) piece concerning\n\
  martian globes that they do, in fact, exist. I used to work for a store called Natural Wonders, which is\n\
  one of those nutty-crunchy yuppie-type earth stores much like some of the ones contacted by Mr.\n\
  Maliszewski. And they definitely sold them. At one point. I can't guarantee that they are still in\n\
  production or still being sold by that particular establishment, which has several hundred locations\n\
  nationwide. But they existed at one point in the not too distant past. Now I work for a computer store. It\n\
  is not quite as interesting as working in a yuppie-type earth store, but the management is more\n\
  compotent, and I get an extra 15 minute break. The one advantage to working in Natural Wonders was\n\
  that it was in a mall. Normally I despise malls, but there was a Cinnabon two stores over, so I always\n\
  had good food. Now I have to drive half a mile to Dunkin Donuts, where the food is not nearly of the\n\
  quality it is at Cinnabon, although I must admit it is quite a bit less expensive. Gasoline expenses,\n\
  however, detract from this potential advantage.\n\
  The second matter I wish to discuss with you is your fourth issue. Is it forthcoming? You say February\n\
  the seventh, yet it is currently March the fifth and I have yet to see it appear in my bookstore (Barnes\n\
  & Noble, Framingham, Massachusetts). I understand you missed your boat, and that I am urged to\n\
  practice patience while waiting for its arrival, but I am growing quite concerned.\n\

  McSweeney's, this is in response to today's work. You're the best.\n\
  For the kind, but desperate, Paul Maliszewski, and his globular troubles: It seems that planets other than\n\
  our own are substantially more expensive, despite the fact that as far as we know, none of them have\n\
  currencies, and as such it would be impossible for them to buy globes of their own, dear planets.\n\
  However for you, as an earthling, you can obtain a globe of one of their planets via the same fair\n\
  medium in which you adverted us to your troubles, the Internet. Try a place called skypub.com or sky\n\
  and telescope or something, at: http://store.skypub.com\n\
  On the front page you'll notice right away you're at the right sort of place, despite the fact that they've a\n\
  bold picture on the front stating \"GET READY for the Messier Marathon!\" Not a horror flick site\n\
  afterall, though, pursuing the subject further I came up with this: \"Log all 109 Messier objects in a single\n\
  night! The Messier Marathon -- a mad dash from target to target lasting from dusk to dawn -- has\n\
  become an annual rite of passage among amateur\n\n\
  astronomers. It is possible only in late March and early April, when the Sun lies in a part of the zodiac\n\
  devoid of Messier's star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. Equip yourself with these useful resources and\n\
  get caught up in Messier Madness!\"I love the thought of amateur astronomers dashing madly from\n\
  target to target -- in an annual right of passage, no less -- logging messier objects. The Messier\n\
  Madness! [insertTwilight Zone soundtrack, or perhaps that of StarTrek]\n\
  Under their pull-down menu you can go to Maps & Globes, and right there, bingo, on the front, a very\n\
  charming globe of the planet Venus ($94.95!), and deeper in, a Mars globe ($84.95 - Why the price\n\
  difference? There's some kind of gender-related joke in here, I'm sure). I wasn't able to find globes of\n\
  any other planets, however. The Mars globe, you'll be happy to note, comes with a clear pedestal and an\n\
  information booklet. Best of luck to you.\n\
