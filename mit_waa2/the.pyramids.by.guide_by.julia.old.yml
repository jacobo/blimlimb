- CAIRO, EGYPT &#151; In Cairo, where most people speak Arabic as well as English and some people speak, in addition to that, Spanish, French, or German, our cab driver knew one American word.
- |
  

- As he weaved through traffic he turned around in his seat so he could face us and said, "Pepsi!
- The next morning, Samh, our guide to the pyramids, picked us up after breakfast.
- |
  

- No one else had eaten since before dawn, as my husband and I arrived here in the ninth month of the Hijra calendar, during Ramadan.
- |
  

- According to the Qu'ran, during Ramadan Muslims can eat and drink only at night, when they cannot "plainly distinguish a white thread from a black thread by the daylight.
- "\" In addition to eating and drinking, Samh explained, it is solely between sundown and sunup that one can smoke, lie, have sex, and think unsavory thoughts."
- |
  

- "\"For instance,\""
- |
  

- "\"I cannot think to myself right now that you have pretty brown eyes."
- Samh is also, we learned, diabetic.
- |
  

- And a six-pack-a-day smoker.
- |
  

- As the day progressed Samh the guide became Samh the cranky, dehydrated Egyptologist with low blood sugar.
- |
  

- I feared he would lapse into shock in the shadow of one of the pyramids.
- "\"Just one little orange slice,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"A sip of water?"
- But he would not be tempted.
- Samh is a PhD candidate in Egyptian history at Cairo University.
- |
  

- Working as a guide to put himself through school, he has collected plenty of irritating evidence that many tourists are misinformed about Egypt's ancient history.
- |
  

- His champion cause was setting us straight.
- |
  

- Samh didn't care about those who firmly believe aliens built the Great Pyramids, his sheep are more subtly astray.
- It was with great care then that Samh tutored us about the mummification process.
- |
  

- Mummification was essential for that boat ride into the afterlife.
- |
  

- It was an intricate process that took more than two months and cost a pretty piastre.
- |
  

- Not for the squeamish, making a mummy meant cutting out the intestines, stomach, lungs, and liver; wrapping them carefully in linen; and squeezing them into canopic jars.
- |
  

- Morticians picked the brain through the nose with long hooks and, as it was presumed unimportant, tossed it in the primeval Egyptian dustbin.
- |
  

- "Each canopic jar had a different sculpture on its lid: falcon for the intestines, jackal for the stomach, baboon for the lungs, and human for the liver."
- |
  

- Archaeologists excavated these four jars and their corresponding contents from tomb after tomb in Egypt.
- Samh taught us this and more as we explored the step pyramids of Zoser.
- |
  

- But, he lamented, since the movie  The Mummy  some cinefile in every group of tourists will inevitably ask, "What about the fifth jar?
- |
  

- The one with the lion's head on it?
- |
  

- "Next stop: Giza Plateau, of the Great Pyramids and Sphinx."
- |
  

- Lucky for us, Giza is located just outside of Cairo, for  The Mummy  would have one believe the Great Pyramids are located a few hundred miles south, in the city of Thebes.
- As Samh showed us around the Sphinx we overheard another tour guide confidently telling his group, "And  this  is the temple of Princess Leia.
- "\"Ah,\""
- |
  

- "\"Which temple?"
- "\" Samh said, \""
- What princess?
- |
  

- And who is Leia?
- His fasting body in need of a rest, Samh passed my husband and me to another guide who led us into the belly of Khafre's pyramid.
- |
  

- This pyramid was the second of the Great Pyramids built, Khafre being the son of Khufu, who built the first and largest of the Giza Plateau pyramids.
- |
  

- Khafre did not want to disrespect his father by building a larger pyramid.
- |
  

- Instead, he built it on slightly higher ground.
- |
  

- Thus it is smaller, covering only eleven square acres, but it looks taller.
- |
  

- Clever Khafre.
- Inside, the pyramid was hot and airless, nothing at all like a cave.
- |
  

- Once at the bottom there was.
- |
  

- The contents have, of course, been carefully excavated and moved to the Egyptian Museum.
- |
  

- But if you go, and you make it all the way to the bottom, you will no doubt be chosen to visit a room that no one else gets to see.
- |
  

- This is simply because you are special.
- |
  

- We were special too, my husband and I, for a stranger appeared from nowhere and led us away, saying, "You come with me because we are friends.
- |
  

- No one else.
- |
  

- Just you.
- When we arrived in a dark, stifling, room, the ancient Egyptian equivalent of a coat closet, our new friend instructed, "Now.
- |
  

- Breathe.
- |
  

- In!
- |
  

- Out!
- |
  

- In!
- |
  

- Out!
- My husband and I breathed.
- |
  

- In.
- |
  

- Out.
- "\"There!"
- "\" he exclaimed, pleased."
- |
  

- "\"Now you will get pregnant."
- |
  

- It was 3:30 in the afternoon, and Samh, near collapse, had saved the best for last.
- |
  

- He was sending us on a camel ride through the Sahara Desert so we could gaze back at the Great Pyramids in the afternoon light.
- |
  

- As we waited for our ruminants to be saddled, Samh told us that our camel guide would likely have a lot to say about the Great Pyramids.
- |
  

- "\"All three are made of limestone and granite,\""
- |
  

- Samh said.
- |
  

- "\"Because they are different colors, he will tell you that one is limestone, one granite, and one basalt."
- |
  

- Also, the top of Khufu's pyramid has worn away over time.
- |
  

- He might tell you that Napoleon shot it off with a cannon.
- Off we rode on our camels into the edge of the Sahara.
- |
  

- Are we Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun?
- |
  

- Popski's Private Army fighting the bad guys during World War II?
- |
  

- Or are we Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz?
- Camels are captivating animals.
- |
  

- Despite that hump in their back they have great posture.
- |
  

- They hold their heads high and never hurry.
- |
  

- And they always have a disinterested, eyes-half-closed, vaguely smarmy grin on their faces.
- |
  

- I'm not sure why, but I decide that it's important that the camels like me, in sort of the same way it's important that ballet dancers and French people like me.
- The sun was setting, and we had to ride back to Samh so he could break his fast for the day.
- |
  

- We stopped for one last look at the Great Pyramids.
- |
  

- It's quiet.
- |
  

- My husband and I look at what has stood almost exactly the same for forty-three centuries.
- "\"Now I will tell you about the Great Pyramids,\""
- |
  

- "\"That one is made of limestone; that one of granite; that one of basalt."
- |
  

- The one on the right is missing its top because Napoleon shot it off with his cannon.
