  "200 Cigarettes"
  You should not see the film called "200 Cigarettes". When I went, the
  theater was almost full. I found a seat by the side exit, next to a
  fashionably dressed young couple sharing a bucket of popcorn. When I saw
  their popcorn it caused me to wish that I also had some popcorn. I got
  up, took off my jacket, and covered the seat with it. My seat was saved.
  I then proceeded to the snack bar and purchased some popcorn of my own.
  When I returned, there was something projected on the movie screen. It
  appeared to be the answer to a trivia question. I do not remember what
  it said. Something having to do with the small dog from television's
  "Frasier." I asked the fashionably dressed young couple what the trivia
  question had been, but they did not seem to understand me. It is
  possible that they were foreign.
  Eventually the film started. The theater was made noticeably darker, and
  the images on the screen were bright and colorful. I enjoyed the first
  part of the film a great deal, until I ran out of popcorn. As I placed
  my empty popcorn container on the floor in front of me, I noticed that
  the fashionably dressed young foreign couple were embracing in an
  obscene manner.
  I was not able to concentrate on the rest of the film. I began to notice
  all of the other people sitting around me, in the dark, thinking and
  doing secret things. I imagined that they were all as aware of my
  presence as I was of theirs. Now that I have obtained some distance from
  the situation, I am confident that this was not the case. At the time,
  it seemed quite plausible.
  I decided to leave the theater for a short time, in order to regain my
  composure. Unfortunately there was an usher standing outside the back
  door, and his demeanor was so surly that I was forced back into the
  darkness. I stood at the end of the aisle for two or three minutes,
  while a particularly slow portion of the film played out. When the
  characters began yelling at each other, I slipped back to my seat. None
  of the audience members indicated that they noticed.
  I watched the rest of the film, only half paying attention. The
  fashionably dressed young foreign couple had stopped embracing, and
  seemed to enjoy what we were watching. I do not understand why this was
  so. "200 Cigarettes" is not a good film.
