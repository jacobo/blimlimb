- George had cardboard ribs.
- |
  

- The rest of his body was regular flesh and bone, but his ribcage and sternum were brown corrugated cardboard.
- |
  

- Every few weeks the cardboard dissolved, pushing through his skin in a sloppy mess.
- |
  

- Without ribs to limit the size of his lungs, they threatened to explode.
- Luckily, George's mother had enough sense to hold his chest when it puffed.
- |
  

- Ages ago, George's uncle had died by bursting, ruining his living room.
- |
  

- When George was born and she felt her son's soft chest, she knew she had to protect him.
- |
  

- She didn't mind.
- |
  

- George became her doll, sleeping beside her under her hand, spending his waking hours on her hip, tied into an apron.
- George's mother took her charge in stride, but she was awed by the responsibility.
- |
  

- Her hand was the only thing keeping her son alive.
- |
  

- If she left him for a minute, his alveoli could stretch like infinite pastry dough.
- |
  

- His lungs would fill with too much air and he would burst.
- |
  

- Then she would find him like his uncle, decorating the living room in a million pieces.
- |
  

- George became her shadow.
- |
  

- When he got too big for her hip, he was never further from her than her left hand, which she kept inside his shirt.
- George's father resented the proximity but what could he do?
- |
  

- He was genetically accountable for his son's bad ribs.
- |
  

- When the boy crowded their bed, the man took the nursery as his room, squishing himself into the unused crib.
- |
  

- Looking at the balloons and clowns on the wallpaper, he felt guilty and lonely, but the bars of the baby bed felt good against him.
- |
  

- When he slept, he dreamt that the wooden bars were his son's ribs, pressing into him.
- |
  

- The dreams sometimes tricked him into feeling happy.
- |
  

- In his sleep, he clutched the wood, ready to make them into new ribs for his son.
- |
  

- But soon enough he saw that he was a grown man in a baby's crib.
- |
  

- George didn't know enough to be mad that he was different.
- |
  

- He didn't want to be anyone but who he was, a part of his mother.
- |
  

- Every seven days he molted his ribs and helped his mother scrape them into the garbage.
- |
  

- He was a good boy, her company, her charm.
- |
  

- Together they laughed at his funny chest, covered with mushy cardboard.
- |
  

- It was just a joke.
- George and his mother lived a long life, longer than his father, whom they buried in the cemetery when George was forty.
- |
  

- The undertaker had trouble stretching the man long in his coffin; his legs wanted to curl up to his chest.
- |
  

- Finally, the undertaker put concrete blocks on the body overnight.
- |
  

- The next morning, the man was straight enough for the funeral.
- The mother and son missed the man.
- |
  

- His ghost snored, rattling the blinds in the nursery, and that was a small comfort to them.
- |
  

- The sound was not unlike the noises that came from George's chest before an episode.
- |
  

- The cardboard strips in his lungs fluttered like fat blinds in a breeze.
- "\"Here comes a change,\""
- |
  

- George said as his ribs pushed up, like a geographic event.
- "\"You are your own planet, my boy,\""
- |
  

- George's mother said time after time.
- |
  

- "\"Constantly changing."
- |
  

- I should take you to school, give the kids a lesson in biology and rocks.
- "\"Yeah,\""
- |
  

- George said, but they never went.
- |
  

- They kept to themselves, to their circuits of shopping and visiting the library.
- |
  

- When they weren't gathering supplies or preparing meals, George's mother read to him in the living room.
- |
  

- She held the book in one hand.
- |
  

- As always, the other hand rested on his chest.
- People didn't judge their attachment.
- |
  

- George was never a Mama's boy, he was Box Boy.
- "\"Hello, Box Boy,\""
- |
  

- "\"Hi, Box Boy,\""
- |
  

- They wished they could be strange, too, like Spiderman or Superman or George.
- |
  

- He was the town's own cartoon character, a hero.
- |
  

- Everyone knew about George's uncle, and how George would end up, like him, as an uneven coat of paint on the ceiling.
- George's mother worried no one would recognize his remains.
- |
  

- She knew she would die first and he would go next, splattering her stiffening body and the furniture.
- |
  

- She wanted her son buried with her.
- |
  

- She made a sign and put it on the front door, warning all who might enter that if they found her dead, her son was gone too, in maybe too fine a spray to be noticed.
- |
  

- The sign noted that George had a condition that made him dependent upon her.
- By the time their deaths arrived, the sign was faded and illegible.
- |
  

- But her fears were unfounded.
- |
  

- People knew how George would go.
- |
  

- And when he did, they knew how he went.
- Though the will directed an exact path to the graveyard, there was speculation throughout the town about how to bury George.
- |
  

- Could anyone gather George from the walls and floors and into a container?
- |
  

- Why not burn down the house and carve a stone with his name along with the name they gave him?
- Because of the will, said the lawyer.
- The boys, grown and young, who admired George and his transformations, carefully removed him and his mother from the living room.
- |
  

- They scraped the scraps of him into an urn that fit inside her coffin.
- The undertaker, however, could never get her hand to rest at her side.
- |
  

- No matter how he tried, it hovered over the urn, ready for George's next change.
