- As if I could harm you.
- |
  

- It's not in my charter.
- |
  

- Please, please me with your presence.
- "UNABLE TO PULL THE PIECES TOGETHER: Please?"

- Thanks.
- |
  

- Right in here, within this enclosure.

- Here's the opening.
- |
  

- An enclosed space.
- |
  

- That wasn't so hard was it?
- "SHALLOW REFLECTIVENESS: Uhrmm, no?"
- "FEELING THAT NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE: Exactly, no."
- |
  

- Now that we're here, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- |
  

- What do you think?
- "PARTLY HALFWAY UNSURE: Think?"
- "MENTAL SHEPHERD OF WAYWARD SHEEP: You'll have to, I believe, to respond to the queries."
- |
  

- You see, I'm interested in you.
- |
  

- In fact, the very you of you attracts me to you.
- |
  

- Your youness.
- "BASHFUL ABOUT EXPOSED ITNESS: Really?"
- "SEIZING OF A SLIGHT AND SLIPPERY ADVANTAGE: Of course, of course."
- |
  

- I'm saying it, you're believing it, then it must be true.
- |
  

- Couldn't you tell?
- "GORDIAN KNOT OF CONFUSION: Yes?"
- "DELICATE MOVEMENT TO NEXT POINT: Refreshments?"
- |
  

- They're free.
- |
  

- They come with the enclosure and are included with all questioning.
- "HUNGRY, BUT BARELY: Sure, if it's free then."
- |
  

- You said it was free right?
- "HAVING NOT INTENDED TO MISLEAD ANYONE: Well, it's free with the questioning."
- |
  

- Basically free you could say.
- |
  

- Or practically.
- |
  

- Practically free would not be an overstatement.
- |
  

- It's included.
- "CAREFUL WEIGHING OF DESIRES: One carbohydrate and one lukewarm liquid please."
- "EXPRESSING UNFELT SURPRISE: An excellent selection."
- |
  

- One of the most popular combinations.
- |
  

- Here you go.
- "RESIGNEDNESS: Thanks."
- "FANFARE OF DIRECTNESS: Now, the following questions will require you to make a distinction."
- |
  

- Please endeavor to do so.
- |
  

- Please.
- "SIX SYLLABLES OF SERIOUSNESS: What's a distinction?"
- KEEPING AN EYE ON THE CURVEBALL, WILL IT HANG?
- |
  

- In what way do you mean?
- "NOW UNSURE OF OWN QUESTION: In the way you were planning on using it."
- "RELIEVED AS UNDER A SNOWMELT WATERFALL: Oh that way."
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- But that's the way I'm using the word.
- |
  

- So I'm afraid, to be fair to you, I can't say.
- |
  

- It's all part of the questioning.
- |
  

- Distinctions are your responsibility, not mine.
- |
  

- Shall we continue?
- "WHATEVER: Oh."
- |
  

- Yeah.
- |
  

- Sure.
- "POINTEDLY GETTING DOWN TO IT: In the following situation which is more comely?"
- |
  

- The shank of a pinto or the actual, not metaphorical, eye of a peacock?
- "NOT WANTING TO FLUB ONE THIS EARLY: What was the situation?"
- "VIEWING IDIOCY WITH VEILED SORROW: They're standing there, side by side, the two of them."
- "POSITIVE: The shank."
- "SOFT INTAKE OF BREATH: When looking to the sky, where are your hands?"
- |
  

- Mind you, it's partly cloudy.
- "GRASPING A STRAW: Over my ears."
- "BORROWED ENCOURAGEMENT: Good."
- |
  

- Good.
- |
  

- Now.
- |
  

- "CONFIDENT, THEN LESS SO: Condensation."
- |
  

- Wait no.
- |
  

- Can I take that back?
- |
  

- They call it sweat now I think, the concealment of sweat.
- |
  

- That's right, right?
- "THOUGHT SO: We have to move on."
- |
  

- Which is a better conversation ice-breaker while waiting for a receipt at a toll booth, a landscape painting you saw once featuring a dilapidated stone wall or the notion that an idea is not known  a priori  but made up when events or stimuli occasion its need, that in fact knowledge is the memory of circumstances in which previously useful ideas arose?
- "DAMP FROM A SWIM IN THE PUBLIC POOL OF LOGIC: The extreme warmness of the weather."
- |
  

- Always.
- |
  

- That's easy.
- "TENSED JAW OF FINAL RESOLVE: Okay, last one."
- |
  

- "Which pair do you most resemble: a sphere and a cylinder, a quail and a jack rabbit, a back hoe and a golf cart, the concept of a cosmic Good and the notion of intentional self-healing, a legal mandate and a political one, the slow walk to nowhere in particular and the jog?"
- "WARMING BENEATH THE DAWN OF SENSE: The spoken and the unspoken."
- |
  

- I think I've got this!
- "THE CHECKING OF A FINAL BOX: This is the final box I'm checking."
- |
  

- Do you accept this?
- "DEFINITE SUBJECT: Yes."
- "PERFECTLY, CIRCUMSPECTLY HONEST: Okay, your scores will be mailed to you in six weeks."
- |
  

- Thanks you.
- |
  

- I mean, thank you.
- |
  

- Here's a coupon for future savings.
- |
  

- Good day.
- "UNWILLING TO DRAW THE LINE: Good day?"
- "DISINTEGRATING IMPETUS: Yes."

- Stop it.
- |
  

- This is the end.
