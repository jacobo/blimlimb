  The river had flowed for thousands of years. Its current was strong
  and proud, its banks clean, and many animals made their homes close to
  its verdant shores. Since time immemorial, this river had been a source
  of life here, and the river was proud. It viewed the animals sipping
  from its waters with munificence, feeling its place affirmed in the
  grand scheme of life.
  One day, Man came to the river armed with plans and drawings, and
  measuring equipment. Then came the machinery, and the noise, and before
  the river knew it, a bridge had been built over its mighty span.
  "How dare you!" cried the river. "I have always been here, providing
  for my flock, giving the gift of life to the flora and fauna that have
  teemed on my shores! How can you think of dismissing my power thus!"
  The bridge did not respond, because it was made of metal and stone,
  and thus could not hear. It merely ignored the river, and stood in stony
  silence. Metally silence, too.
  The river grew angry, and plotted its revenge. It was patient: it had
  been here for thousands of years. Slowly, slowly, slowly, by eroding the
  banks and the foundation of rock upon which it rested, the river ate
  away at the bridge's support. A thousandth of a millimeter, year after
  year. Unfortunately the river came from a pretty constant source, and
  the rainfall in these parts was not particularly great, so it could not
  create giant waves to destroy the bridge in one crashing
  metaphorically-representative swoop. But it kept eating away, year after
  year.
  The bridge remained silent, year after year.
  Then one day, the foundation finally became too weak to support the
  bridge, and it gave way. The bridge came crashing down into the river
  in a mess of twisted metal, shards of broken stone, snapped cables.
  "Ha HAH!" cried the river. "I have finally defeated you, along with
  foolish Man who tried to contain my mighty span!"
  Unfortunately, Man had already defeated itself thousands of years
  prior, in a nuclear conflagration that had killed everybody off. Not
  only that, but the war had destroyed most animal life and vegetation, so
  the banks of the river were empty and fallow, and the surface of the
