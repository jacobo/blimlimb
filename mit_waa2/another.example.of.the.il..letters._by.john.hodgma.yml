- Dear Josh,
- Thank you for your recent note.
- |
  

- I see your point.
- |
  

- Given your demanding job as a temporary employee, it may be difficult to find the time to write the novels that I tell you to write.
- |
  

- On the other hand, many of the great works of our time were written by those who held full time jobs--in fact, salaried positions with benefits.
- |
  

- Melville, for example, was a famous whaler.
- |
  

- Did you know that?
- |
  

- Borges was a jeweler.
- |
  

- Some critics argue that their writings were enriched by their every day, 9-5 experience in the office.
- |
  

- But whatever the case, they MADE the time to write.
- |
  

- You should think about that.
- |
  

- "Josh: what's ironic is that, by suggesting plots to you, I am actually trying to save you time."
- |
  

- I am trying to save both of us precious  time .
- In this regard, let us speak for a moment about the  timeliness  of novels.
- |
  

- Here's an example.
- |
  

- Did you happen to read the paper today?
- |
  

- Did you see the article about the man who lived in the subway tunnels and forged a crown of used Metrocards and rode around on a giant (yet gentle) alligator from station to station claiming to be the King Under The Ground?
- |
  

- Did you make it to the page wherein it was reported that, some years ago, he saved a poor orphan girl who had accidentally slipped off the platform onto the tracks?
- |
  

- How he trained her in the ancient arts of Kung Fu in the pitch black of the oldest, deepest tunnels--such that by puberty, she could throw a punch through the inky darkness with blind, preternatural accuracy?
- |
  

- Did you go on to read how after the King was killed by his deathless nemesis, a cruel MTA environmental engineer who had made a private vow to scrub the subway system clean of all grime, vermin, and pretenders to imaginary thrones, the young girl, now a coltish young woman with pale, pale skin was forced to emerge from her subterranean cocoon and make her way in the surface world?
- |
  

- How she soon became the Tri-State Kung Fu Champion (Women's Division), often pummeling men three times her size to unapologetic tears--even when she was blindfolded?
- |
  

- Remember, she was trained in total DARKNESS!
- |
  

- If so, then you also read about how she swore revenge on the brutal MTA engineer, forsaking a large fortune in Kung Fu tourney winnings to return to the dark realm of The King Under The Ground.
- |
  

- You'll recall how her adopted father's killer resigned from the city's payroll, how it was rumored that he had disappeared into the tunnels he once patrolled.
- |
  

- How, for seven years, the young woman tracked him through the bores and crawlspaces beneath the city, foiling his many boobytraps, battling his armies of deformed flunkies, finally cornering him in a great tiled and antique subway station, long abandoned.
- |
  

- How she found in her old foe an old man, now too pitiable to  kill.
- |
  

- How she learned, then and suddenly, forgiveness--a trait her foster father had long sought to train in her, which lesson she never fully learned until now.
- |
  

- How, pardoning the engineer, leaving him to the muck and mire in which he had already buried himself, she returned to our sunlit world, wise and-impossibly-even more beautiful.
- Well, that would make a great novel, Josh.
- |
  

- Or a pretty good screenplay.
- |
  

- But it's too late for that one.
- |
  

- By the time you read this, the 10,000 monkeys at their 10,000 typewriters have already stolen that story from the newsprint, sent it to their agents, and sold the film rights for more money than you will ever see.
- |
  

- The hacks have outwitted you (and me!
- |
  

- And I only mention it to point out that every moment that you hesitate, every moment that you do not write what you see before you EVERY DAY, is a moment that you become more and more the cubicle-jockey, temp-wage, toner sniffing, mutant foot-soldier that you currently are, instead of the beautiful, instinctive, coltish, Kung Fu master-artist that I know YOU CAN BE!
- |
  

- Perhaps it's not too late for you to write that internet thriller I mentioned you.
- |
  

- Get back to me on this.
- Regards from your cousin,
- John Hodgman

  Dear Josh,
  Thank you for your recent note. I see your point. Given your demanding
  job
  as a temporary employee, it
  may be difficult to find the time to write the novels that I tell you
  to
  write. On the other hand, many
  of the great works of our time were written by those who held full time
  jobs--in fact, salaried
  positions with benefits. Melville, for example, was a famous whaler.
  Did you
  know that? Borges was a
  jeweler. Some critics argue that their writings were enriched by their
  every
  day, 9-5 experience in the
  office. But whatever the case, they MADE the time to write. You should
  think
  about that. Josh: what's
  ironic is that, by suggesting plots to you, I am actually trying to
  save you
  time. I am trying to save
  both of us precious  time .
  In this regard, let us speak for a moment about the  timeliness  of
  novels.
  Here's an example. Did you happen to read the paper today? Did you see
  the
  article about the man who lived in the subway tunnels and forged a
  crown of
  used Metrocards and rode around on a giant (yet gentle) alligator from
  station to station claiming to be the King Under The Ground? Did you
  make it
  to the page wherein it was reported that, some years ago, he saved a
  poor
  orphan girl who had accidentally slipped off the platform onto the
  tracks?
  How he trained her in the ancient arts of Kung Fu in the pitch black of
  the
  oldest, deepest tunnels--such that by puberty, she could throw a punch
  through the inky darkness with blind, preternatural accuracy?
  Did you go on to read how after the King was killed by his deathless
  nemesis, a cruel MTA environmental engineer who had made a private vow
  to
  scrub the subway system clean of all grime, vermin, and pretenders to
  imaginary thrones, the young girl, now a coltish young woman with pale,
  pale
  skin was forced to emerge from her subterranean cocoon and make her way
  in
  the surface world? How she soon became the Tri-State Kung Fu Champion
  (Women's Division), often pummeling men three times her size to
  unapologetic
  tears--even when she was blindfolded?! (Remember, she was trained in
  total
  DARKNESS!)
  If so, then you also read about how she swore revenge on the brutal MTA
  engineer, forsaking a large fortune in Kung Fu tourney winnings to
  return to
  the dark realm of The King Under The Ground. You'll recall how her
  adopted
  father's killer resigned from the city's payroll, how it was rumored
  that he
  had disappeared into the tunnels he once patrolled. How, for seven
  years,
  the young woman tracked him through the bores and crawlspaces beneath
  the
  city, foiling his many boobytraps, battling his armies of deformed
  flunkies,
  finally cornering him in a great tiled and antique subway station, long
  abandoned.  How she found in her old foe an old man, now too pitiable
  to
  
  kill. How she learned, then and suddenly, forgiveness--a trait her
  foster
  father had long sought to train in her, which lesson she never fully
  learned
  until now. How, pardoning the engineer, leaving him to the muck and
  mire in
  which he had already buried himself, she returned to our sunlit world,
  wise
  and-impossibly-even more beautiful.
  Well, that would make a great novel, Josh. Or a pretty good screenplay.
  But
  it's too late for that one.  By the time you read this, the 10,000
  monkeys
  at their 10,000 typewriters have already stolen that story from the
  newsprint, sent it to their agents, and sold the film rights for more
  money
  than you will ever see. The hacks have outwitted you (and me!) again.
  And I
  only mention it to point out that every moment that you hesitate, every
  moment that you do not write what you see before you EVERY DAY, is a
  moment
  that you become more and more the cubicle-jockey, temp-wage, toner
  sniffing,
  mutant foot-soldier that you currently are, instead of the beautiful,
  instinctive, coltish, Kung Fu master-artist that I know YOU CAN BE!
  Perhaps it's not too late for you to write that internet thriller I
  mentioned you. Get back to me on this.
