  Robert Coover was my teacher before I ever met him, and his fiction continues to be what I dream of aspiring to: mad, beautiful, inventive, and unprecedented. His collection of stories,  Pricksongs and Descants , which I read when I thought fiction was about men in flannel who were below-average hunters and had precisely six words to say to each other, literally unlocked a world to me of blendered language, hyperactive story, and mythology gone wild. He burned the flannel off those hunters, made them speak in weird accents, and killed them off as soon as they got maudlin. Sometimes he also gave them diseases of the ass. The laughter that came out of that book was slightly dark and a bit wet at the mouth&#8212;a sinister vaudeville re-creating the history of the world. You could hear the whip lashing at the whole body politic of conservative, safe fiction. It was a much-needed thrashing.
  When I was finally lucky enough to enroll in Coover&#8217;s courses, I encountered a man who was easily, easily, the most generous, rabidly intelligent, accessible, wide-ranging, erudite, and hilarious teacher I have ever met. For a man of his accomplishments to be so kind and committed seemed to me exceedingly rare. He labored tirelessly, and with great insight, at his students&#8217; writing, and he stayed several steps ahead of us with new writers to read and new forms to try.
  In his many books since  Pricksongs , Coover has continued to ignore the distinction between the history of ideas and the history of story. Sexed-up fairy tales, stories refracted through drug-smeared mirrors, nonfictional forms prostituted into novels, the domestic novel turned on its head and emptied, finally, of its dear cheese. He also writes a lot about boners. All the fiction tricks we think are new were built in Coover&#8217;s backyard shed. But do not try to visit this shed, because the sparks flying out of it might blind you.
