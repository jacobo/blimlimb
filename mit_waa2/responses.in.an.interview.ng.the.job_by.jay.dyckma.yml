- |
  

- No, I don't remember their names.
- |
  

- Certain studies have found that long afternoons in front of the television watching  People's Court  more than accomplishes these goals.

- |
  

- Oh, on that note, how many of yours are blonds?
- |
  

- "\"I completely agree."
- |
  

- Exposure to a variety of cultures is very important.
- |
  

- And that's why I'm a fan of the OTB.

- It's diverse, but never in that pretentious, look-at-me kind of way.
- |
  

- "\"I've explained this several times."
- |
  

- The shaking was part of the game.
- |
  

- The telling was not.
- |
  

- "\"At-home productions of classical theater are really a trademark of mine."
- |
  

- I firmly believe every child should be exposed to the genius of Shakespeare.
- |
  

- Which, of course, made that incident with the Moore family just so unfortunate.
- |
  

- Well, between you and me, I think the Moores are just a little slow, if you know what I mean.
- |
  

- Everyone knows that boys played the girl roles in traditional Elizabethan theater.
- |
  

- And, oh, the cheekbones on little Bobby Moore.
- |
  

- A stunning Juliet, really.
