- Dear Parents of J-Dawg,
- I am in receipt of your letter of April 8, 2002, asking me to quit calling your son "Stud.
- "\" I haven't, in the past, or seeable future called your son, \""
- Stud.
- "\" I don't use terms like that."
- |
  

- I'd give out a smackdown to anyone who throws around swears, cusses, or sexual implications on my ballfield.
- |
  

- Because why?
- |
  

- Because I am aware of responsibilities.
- |
  

- Why else?
- |
  

- Because I am an accomplished coach.
- |
  

- And why else?
- |
  

- Because I know what it means to be a coach saddled with a coach's responsibilities.
- |
  

- Like, I know that the city owns the ballfield, right?
- |
  

- But, I take SOOO much responsibility for the boys and the town and for positive goodness that I regard the ball field as mine when my squad is working on a game or practice situation.
- |
  

- The ball field is in my domain.
- |
  

- Also, my domain is on the ball field.
- Anyway, I probably called Jason "dude.
- "\" Which is a good term."
- |
  

- Not as upbeat as "
- |
  

- "\" or \""
- |
  

- "\" The wind is loud in the spring and it has a tendency to manipulate sounds out of adults or children's mouths."
- |
  

- Then people hear things, like Mooper Swartz thought I called his son Randy a friggin' cocksucker, end quote.
- |
  

- Just because he missed a pop-up against the Arby's Rams.
- |
  

- By missing the pop-up and sending us into extra innings is why, as you might recall, I signaled your J-Dawg to hurl a fastball at Timmy Jericho's head.
- |
  

- Otherwise we would have been captured, cooked, and eaten, this at the hands of a team of utter cream-tasters and tulip-touchers.
- |
  

- See, missing a pop-up causes danger for all the kids.
- |
  

- So, I called to Randy Watch that sucker!
- |
  

- Maalox and the George Michael SportsMachine.
- |
  

- How does someone hear something bad?
- |
  

- Especially when they claim to have never used a disgusting phrase themselves?
- |
  

- Sheesh.
- I can be, it is true, somewhat aggressible about baseball, but less than Bobby Knight and his tactics of coaching basketball for the Hoosiers, okay?
- |
  

- I don't apologize for being MY way.
- |
  

- Because when a history book is written, there is no section for LOSERS.
- |
  

- But, I will never throw heavy stuff or swear, and I will monitor the boys' habits and deter them from the chewing of tobacco and crack down on their illegal abscondation of all tobacco products.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Because I signed a contract with HALLB, and because I am the good guy who has been known to participate in conversations with our lord and saver Jesus Christ on every single Sunday I don't have something else going on.
- "The bottom line is this: YOU can count on me!"
- Warm wishes,
- Coach Sean.

  Dear Parents of J-Dawg,
  I am in receipt of your letter of April 8, 2002, asking me to quit calling your son "Stud." I haven't, in the past, or seeable future called your son, "Stud." I don't use terms like that. I'd give out a smackdown to anyone who throws around swears, cusses, or sexual implications on my ballfield. Because why? Because I am aware of responsibilities. Why else? Because I am an accomplished coach. And why else? Because I know what it means to be a coach saddled with a coach's responsibilities. Like, I know that the city owns the ballfield, right? But, I take SOOO much responsibility for the boys and the town and for positive goodness that I regard the ball field as mine when my squad is working on a game or practice situation. The ball field is in my domain. Also, my domain is on the ball field.
  Anyway, I probably called Jason "dude." Which is a good term. Not as upbeat as "mini-pro" or "slugger." The wind is loud in the spring and it has a tendency to manipulate sounds out of adults or children's mouths. Then people hear things, like Mooper Swartz thought I called his son Randy a friggin' cocksucker, end quote. Just because he missed a pop-up against the Arby's Rams. By missing the pop-up and sending us into extra innings is why, as you might recall, I signaled your J-Dawg to hurl a fastball at Timmy Jericho's head. Otherwise we would have been captured, cooked, and eaten, this at the hands of a team of utter cream-tasters and tulip-touchers. See, missing a pop-up causes danger for all the kids. So, I called to Randy Watch that sucker!! end quote, meaning the sucker = baseball, which just landed and gave up two runs, sending us into extra innings and sending me headlong into a long night alone with nothing to help me but Maalox and the George Michael SportsMachine. How does someone hear something bad? Especially when they claim to have never used a disgusting phrase themselves? Sheesh.
  I can be, it is true, somewhat aggressible about baseball, but less than Bobby Knight and his tactics of coaching basketball for the Hoosiers, okay? I don't apologize for being MY way.
