- THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF FICTIONAL ANECDOTES AND STORIES FEATURING ABBOTT AND COSTELLO.
- BY  KEVIN GUILFOILE
- |
  

- Before I give you the details of that infamous trip, you'll enjoy this story about the time I ran into Minta Durfee, Fatty Arbuckle's first wife.
- |
  

- We had just finished supper at "21" when I saw her sitting alone at the bar having a drink, so I introduced myself and told her that the first picture I ever saw was "Fatty's Magic Pants.
- "\" I thought it would make her feel good, perhaps remind her of the days before talkies, when she was still a star."
- |
  

- "\"Beat it, Bub,\""
- |
  

- Can you believe it?
- |
  

- She called me Bub!
- |
  

- Minta Durfee!
- Anyway, that Friday, we picked up Joseph Cotten and took the train down to Washington to see Joe Louis fight Buddy Baer.
- |
  

- On the way, Bud and Lou started arguing about the best way to bring "Who's On First" to the silver screen.
- "\"We'll have to make some changes, of course,\""
- |
  

- Bud said.
- "\"What are you talking about?"
- "\" Lou sighed."
- |
  

- "\"It's perfect the way it is."
- "\"The whole 'third base' bit."
- |
  

- It doesn't work.
- Lou's pupils rolled so far under his eyebrows he could watch himself think.
- |
  

- "\"Oh, for crying out loud."
- |
  

- I thought you stopped grinding that ax after we did the Kate Smith Radio Hour.
- "\"Radio audiences are less discriminating,\""
- |
  

- Bud said.
- |
  

- "\"A paying crowd won't put up with that sloppy, off-Vaudeville stuff."
- "\"Tell me again."
- |
  

- What's wrong with it?
- "\"Okay."
- |
  

- Who's on first.
- |
  

- That's fine.
- |
  

- I can see a guy named Who, or somebody with Who as a nickname&#151;"
- "\"Maybe he looks like an owl,\""
- |
  

- Joe offered.
- "\"Exactly."
- |
  

- What's on second.
- |
  

- I'll buy that, too.
- |
  

- His last name is 'Watts.
- |
  

- So far so good.
- |
  

- But  I Don't Know is on third?
- |
  

- Who could believe this fellow is named I Don't Know?
- "\"Yes,\""
- |
  

- Lou said.
- "\"Who could?"
- "\"That's right."
- Bud stared coldly into Lou's eyes.
- |
  

- "\"Shut the fuck up."
- "\"Listen to me,\""
- |
  

- Lou said.
- |
  

- "\"The whole point is that the players have ridiculous names."
- |
  

- We set it up in the very first line.
- "\" He began the routine with a credible, if mocking, impersonation of Bud: \""
- You know it seems to me they give these ballplayers now-a-days very peculiar names.
- |
  

- "\"But, it only works if you keep it believable,\""
- |
  

- Bud interrupted.
- |
  

- "\"For instance, the pitcher and catcher are Today and Tomorrow."
- |
  

- Those could be nicknames.
- |
  

- But I Don't Know?
- |
  

- You'd never call a real person I Don't Know.
- "\" Bud pointed to a bystander in the bar car, a black-derbied dandy trying to pose like Clark Gable, although he looked to me more like Mae Clarke in  Sailors On Leave."
- |
  

- "\"Hey, over there!"
- "\" Bud shouted."
- |
  

- "\"Isn't that the great third baseman Frank 'I Don't Know' Baker!"
- "\" The fop looked puzzled and quickly reached for his drink."
- |
  

- Bud shook his head.
- |
  

- "\"It doesn't make any sense."
- Lou began to sputter.
- |
  

- "\"Look, Abbott, the funniest part of the act is when we say 'I don't know."
- |
  

- THIRD BASE!
- |
  

- "\"That always gets the biggest laugh,\""
- |
  

- I agreed.
- Bud turned his wrist, creating a dismissive funnel of scotch in his glass.
- |
  

- "\"They'll be laughing at us all right."
- |
  

- I'm telling you, we oughta change it back to Pete Smee.
- Lou threw up his arms.
- |
  

- "\"Here we go with the Pete Smee again."
- |
  

- Here we go!
- "\"'Pete Smee."
- |
  

- Third base.
- |
  

- That's every bit as funny as I Don't Know.
- |
  

- Funnier even, because it's logical.
- "\" This time Bud launched into the routine, caustically reading Lou's lines in the voice of Shemp Howard."
- |
  

- "\"What's the name of the guy playing first base&nbsp;/ What's on second&nbsp;/ I'm not asking ya who's on second&nbsp;/ Who's on first&nbsp;/ Beats me&nbsp;/ THIRD BASE!"
- "\"That's the stupidest thing I ever heard."
- "\"It's funnier."
- Lou turned to me and then to Joe and then back to Bud.
- |
  

- "\"You don't understand this routine at all, do you, Abbott?"
- "\"I understand it better than you."
- It was like that all the way down and all the way back.
- |
  

- Our only respite came during the three-minute intervals in which the Champ mechanically pummeled that milksop Baer.
- |
  

- Nevertheless, every time you'd ask Bud a question, he'd shrug and say "Pete Smee!
- "\" and then Lou would make whimpering noises and I'd have to pretend to hold him back."
- |
  

- Sometimes I think they paid me 20 dollars a week to write jokes, and the other 20 dollars was for pretending to keep Lou from throttling Bud in public.
- The act amused everyone at ringside, though.
- |
  

- Mary Astor was laughing so hard she spit a peanut that hit Tommy Dorsey in the ear.
- |
  

- He just sort of waved at it, but didn't turn around, so Mary spit another one and nailed him square in the melon.
- |
  

- She spit peanuts at him all night and he kept scratching his head but he never turned around.
- |
  

- It was a stitch.
- After we dropped Joe off, Bud and Lou really gave me the business about my Frankenstein script.
- |
  

- "\"What's the Wolfman doing in here?"
- |
  

- And Dracula?
- "\" Lou waved the pages in my face."
- |
  

- "\"You see, kid, in two weeks we start shooting  Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein."
- |
  

- If the horror schtick is still pulling 'em in, then next month we can make  Abbott and Costello Meet Dracula.
- |
  

- The month after that, we'll do the Wolfman, and then the Mummy, and Jekyll and Hyde and so forth.
- |
  

- You got six different pictures in here, pally.
- |
  

- Pace yourself.
- "\" I think Bud was still steamed because I took Lou's side on the Pete Smee issue."
- |
  

- I don't know what crawled up Lou's ass.
- The next day we went back to California.
- |
  

- I've always hated air travel, but it was even worse with the boys.
- |
  

- Between New York and LA, they'd do every single bit from "Keep 'Em Flying.
- "\" It impressed the gals, of course, and Bud and Lou were always generous enough to toss an extra stewardess my way, but when they'd make me put on a WAC uniform and read Martha Raye's lines, I wished there had been someone on the payroll to hold  me  back."
