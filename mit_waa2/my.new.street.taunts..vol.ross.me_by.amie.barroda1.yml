- I will sedate you with a drug used for sedation, then I will remove your eyes, and insert two small sparrows into the house that is your skull.
- |
  

- Then I will replace your eyeballs, careful to see that each eye is returned into its proper respective hole.
- |
  

- You will awake thinking nothing has happened.
- |
  

- You will feel right as rain.
- Speaking of rain, friend, spring approaches, and the songbird sets about her singing, to attract mates.
- |
  

- The male bird finds the female bird, and then the two birds make love, many times.
- |
  

- The female lays her eggs and sits on them, to keep them warm.
- |
  

- When the chicks hatch, it will get weird for you.
- |
  

- I will shine your shoes until they become progressively shinier and blind you.
- |
  

- Then, while you are blind, I will take all your possessions and donate them to the homeless, and replace your possessions.
- |
  

- For example, if you had a cup, then I would replace that cup.
- |
  

- If that cup was purchased from Pier One Imports, then I would get you a newer cup, also from Pier One Imports.
- |
  

- It would be extremely confusing to you in your blinded state, and there would also be knives.
- |
  

- Moving around your apartment, filled with all of my carefully chosen furniture, and knives, you will grow frantic, and begin to flail your hands.
- |
  

- Then you will fall down on one of my knives and cut yourself very badly.
- |
  

- In your stupor of pain, you will cut yourself a second time.
- |
  

- I will make a small caged enclosure and fill it with albinos who prefer tight clothing.
- |
  

- I will provide the albinos with needles, and thread.
- |
  

- Then I will build an oasis.
- |
  

- I will dress you in oversize clothes, and drop you into this oasis, in the company of the albinos, who will be instructed of your blindness.
- |
  

- They will drug you.
- |
  

- While you slumber, they will remove your clothing and alter it.
- |
  

- When you awaken, you will notice no change.
- |
  

- The albinos will take their time.
- |
  

- You will make meals with the albinos, and lounge about the oasis.
- |
  

- At night, however, the albinos will drug you and take in your pants.
- "It will go on like this for many years: You will awake, and then the albinos will drug you, and set about their altering."
- |
  

- Then you will be in tight clothes.
- |
  

- I will cut off your feet, and rub them with oil.
- |
  

- I will make a short dough (a short dough is a dough with a lot of butter in it), and wrap each of your feet in this dough.
- |
  

- Then I will bake my pies at high temperatures.
- |
  

- While I wait, I will pour myself a glass of wine and enjoy it.
- |
  

- Then several of my associates and I will cauterize your stumps, and you will serve us your feet, with vegetables, on platters.
- |
  

- We will delictate over them.
- |
  

- Afterwards, you will do the dishes by hand.
- |
  

- I will get you a job at my diner, where you will be known as Scrub.
- |
  

- While in my employ, you will meet a man, Arthur, who will please you with his personality.
- |
  

- When I take Arthur away in my helicopter, the two of you will be allowed to communicate only by phone.
- |
  

- Arthur is the only man who will have you, and he&nbsp;&#151; while attractive to many&nbsp;&#151; is all alone except for myself and this phone.
- |
  

- The two of you will stay up late nights arguing and fighting about who loves who the most and who has the least experience and who is the most wide-eyed in general with respect to the world and then I will cut the phone lines.
- |
  

- When I call you to tell you that I have killed Arthur, Arthur will have no way of telling you that it is a lie.
- |
  

- This, friend, is what it sounds like when doves cry.
- |
  

- And finally I will hire you at my video store.
- |
  

- All day, I will call you, and say nothing but "Hola.
- "\" You will say, \""
- Hello?
- "\" and I will say \""
- Hola.
- "\" You will say \""
- Who's this?
- "\" and I will answer \""
- Hola.
- "\" Some days, I will wait a while before I call."
- |
  

- You will think, "
- Maybe Amie won't call me today.
- |
  

- Maybe I'm forgiven.
- "\" Then the phone will ring."
- |
  

- You will pick up the phone, and I will say, "
- Hola.
- |
