  Political Satire in Modern Literature: C\n\
  George often seems bored in class, but I do find it heartening to find him so engaged in our discussion on  Animal Farm , even if he frequently asks how \"all of these animals are talking.\" In his essay, George wrote passionately about the \"oinkers and moo-cows striving for freedom and democracy, defending themselves bravely against the evil dictator Jones.\" Unfortunately, George seems to have not fully grasped (or fully read) much of the rest of the book. He describes the animals' lives as a perfect example of what happens when democracy is allowed to flourish. He also says that \"Napoleon did a heck of a job\" and that Snowball should \"stop doing that shit.\" While I can live with the profanity, the analysis leaves a lot to be desired.\n\
