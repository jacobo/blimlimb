- "JOHN: I'm getting a letter J. Or possibly a G."
- "DENISE: Could it be a C?"
- "JOHN: Sure."
- "DENISE: Omigod!"
- |
  

- It's Carl!
- "JOHN: He's waving."
- |
  

- "DENISE: (hysterical) I miss you Carl!"
- "JOHN: He wants you to know that you don't need to yell and that he's not feeling any pain."
- "DENISE: (weeping and nodding her head) Carl hated pain so much."
- "JOHN: He says that he left you something."
- "DENISE: (collapsing into the arms of an excited female companion) I found his watch!"
- |
  

- I found his watch in the sofa when I was sticky-rolling cat hair before the wake!
- "JOHN: He wants you to treasure it forever, to keep it in a special place."
- |
  

- "Was there a spot in the house that had particular meaning for the two of you: a box for valuables with a hidden compartment, or&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;wait&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;a place where he used to hide gifts?"
- "DENISE: I already gave it to my one friend from work."
- "JOHN: Oh."
- "DENISE: His name's Phil."
- |
  

- He always admired it.
- "JOHN: Carl says that's okay."
- "DENISE: I suppose I could ask for it back."
- "JOHN: Look, it's not a big deal."
- |
  

- Phil can keep the watch.
- |
  

- That's what Carl says.
- "DENISE: I can ask Phil."
- |
  

- He'll understand.
- "JOHN: Carl wanted you to have it, but now he wants Phil to have it."
- "DENISE: I'll ask him to return it."
- |
  

- Phil's a really good guy.
- |
  

- He needed a watch, and he liked Carl's because it had a second hand, and Phil sometimes needs one to time the PSAs he writes for the radio.
- |
  

- But he'll understand.
- |
  

- Carl wants me to have it.
- "JOHN: For Christ's sake, Denise, what Carl wants is for you to knock the passive-aggressive shit off."
- "DENISE: Sorry."
- "JOHN: He's showing me water now."
- |
  

- Does that mean anything to you?
- "DENISE: Our honeymoon!"
- |
  

- St.
- |
  

- Croix!
- |
  

- We always said it was the happiest eight days we'll ever spend on this earth.
- |
  

- We were planning another trip for the fall.
- "JOHN: He's showing me beaches."
- |
  

- The two of you holding hands.
- |
  

- I can see a bicycle&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;no, no!
- |
  

- "DENISE: Also, he drowned."
- "JOHN: What's that you say?"
- "DENISE: The water."
- |
  

- He might be showing you the water because he drowned in the lake.
- "JOHN: No. No. I don't think so."
- |
  

- I'm definitely getting a honeymoon vibe here.
- "DENISE: Don't you think that's weird?"
- "JOHN: Why?"
- "DENISE: Well, Carl just drowned like six weeks ago, and the police don't think it was an accident."
- |
  

- If he's showing you water don't you think he might be trying to tell me who his killer is, instead of just sending you vacation snapshots from a honeymoon that took place ten years ago?
- "JOHN: I don't know."
- |
  

- Uh.
- |
  

- When I said "water," your first thought was St. Croix?
- "DENISE: I was trying to think happy thoughts."
- "JOHN: There you go."
- |
  

- He doesn't want to upset you.
- "DENISE: Well can you ask him?"
- "JOHN: Ask him what?"
- "DENISE: Ask him who his killer is."
- "JOHN: (bringing his finger to his temple) He says he slipped."
- "DENISE: Slipped?"
- "JOHN: Yep."
- "DENISE: Are you certain?"
- "JOHN: Let me double-check for you."
- |
  

- Slipped, slipped, slipped.
- |
  

- Clear as day.
- "DENISE: Are you sure he might not be telling you \"Skip\"? His brother Skip is one of the prime suspects in his murder."
- "JOHN: I'm pretty sure I can tell the difference between \"Skip\" and \"slip."
- "DENISE: You couldn't tell the difference between \"G\" and \"J."
- "JOHN: Those were in lowercase cursive."
- "DENISE: What if \"slip\" means \"boat slip."
- "JOHN: What are you getting at, Denise?"
- "DENISE: That maybe \"Skip\" killed Carl in the \"boat slip."
- "JOHN: Carl thinks not."
- "DENISE: \"Not\" or \"knot\"?"
- "JOHN: N-O-T."
- |
  

- Not.
- "DENISE: How do you know?"
- |
  

- What if Skip used a "slipknot" to strangle Carl?
- "JOHN: Well, which was it?"
- |
  

- Was he drowned or strangled?
- "DENISE: Drowned."
- "JOHN: See?"
- |
  

- Not "k-n-o-t.
- "\" Just \""
- |
  

- "\" as in \""
- Not Skip in the slip with the slipknot.
- "DENISE: Okay."
- "JOHN: Can we move on?"
- "DENISE: Sure."
- "JOHN: What else do you want to ask Carl?"
- "DENISE: What is heaven like?"
- "JOHN: (settling down now, eyes shut, both hands to his hairline) I'm getting a movie."
- |
  

- He says it's just like in the movie.
- "DENISE: Which movie?"
- "JOHN: He says you'll know."
- "DENISE: \"Crumb\"?"
- "JOHN: (opening his eyes) Oh, for crying out loud."
- |
  

- Think about that for a minute.
- |
  

- How could heaven possibly be like the movie "Crumb"?
- "DENISE: That was the first thing that popped into my head."
- "JOHN: \"Crumb\" was?"
- "DENISE: Yes."
- "JOHN: There's nothing even remotely magical or heaven-like in that film."
- "DENISE: You said Carl said I would know what he meant, and I thought of \"Crumb,\" as clear as if Carl himself put it in my mind."
- "JOHN: (sighing) Heaven is not like \"Crumb,\" Denise. \"Crumb\" is a documentary, for God's sake."
- "DENISE: Fine."
- |
  

- You ask him what movie he means, then.
- "JOHN: (agitated now, fingers quickly to his temple once more) \"Like Water For Chocolate."
- "DENISE: I've never seen that."
- |
  

- Neither has Carl.
- "JOHN: You have to stop resisting, Denise."
- |
  

- Listen to what Carl is telling you.
- |
  

- He's showing me water.
- |
  

- Then, "Like Water For Chocolate"...
- "DENISE (making a face): \"Like Water For Chocolate\"? That's foreign, right? Is it on DVD?"
- "JOHN: I have no idea."
- "DENISE: Ask him if there's another movie I can rent on DVD that's sort of what heaven looks like."
- "JOHN: (staring at her blankly)."
- "DENISE: I don't like to rent tapes anymore."
- |
  

- They get stuck in our machine.
- |
  

- How about "Snatch"? Is heaven anything like "Snatch"?
- |
  

- That's got a ton of extra features.
- "JOHN: (still staring)."
- "DENISE: Two discs."
- "JOHN: (staring)."
