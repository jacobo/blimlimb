- Dear Carly,
- Nice song.
- |
  

- Wow, you really stuck it to me, eh?
- |
  

- Yes, ma'am.
- Jesus, you are one bitter woman, Carly Simon.
- Listen, I'm pretty busy right now with high-profile meetings and social engagements, but there were things I simply could not let stand.
- First of all, that party  took place  on a yacht.
- |
  

- So the way I walked in was perfectly appropriate.
- |
  

- In fact, there is a certain way that one is expected to conduct oneself in such a situation.
- |
  

- I could explain but I doubt you're interested.
- |
  

- As for the apricot scarf and the tilted hat, again, perfectly appropriate for a maritime soiree.
- |
  

- Look it up.
- |
  

- I'm sorry you had a problem with that.
- |
  

- Funny, there were plenty of girls that night who certainly had no quarrel.
- Secondly, yes, I went up to Saratoga for an important horserace.
- |
  

- And yes, my horse won, thanks to years of training and the hard work of all the people involved.
- |
  

- Is this a bad thing?
- |
  

- And yes, I did take the jet to Nova Scotia.
- |
  

- I would do it again in an instant.
- |
  

- Have you ever seen the total eclipse of the sun, Carly?
- |
  

- It's one of the most amazing natural phenomena one could witness, so, if I have the means to see it, I don't see that as vanity, I see it as being fully alive.
- |
  

- I also took 35 orphans up there with me, free of charge, but there's nothing about that in your song.
- |
  

- All right, I didn't really do that.
- |
  

- But I thought about it and that's what matters.
- Third, pursuant to your charge that I was with an "underworld spy," I can't discuss that. But I am known to spend time with wives of close friends. And what do I do with said women, Carly? Talk. Have tea. Catch a movie or attend a polo match. These women's husbands are entertainers and travel quite a bit, so I spend time with them, because that's what friends do. And sometimes I have sex with them. But not as often as you might think.
- Look, we could bicker over these particulars all day long and accomplish little.
- |
  

- "My chief quarrel with you is more existential: I know the song is about me, so how does recognizing that fact make me vain?"
- |
  

- Honestly, if someone shouted "Hey, Carly Simon!
- "\" at you and you turned around, would that be a sign of vanity?"
- |
  

- No. It would be a simple recognition of reality.
- |
  

- If the song were actually about Spiro Agnew and I thought it was about me, that would be vain.
- |
  

- But your use of the second person ("
- |
  

- "\") combined with the details about the horse and the jet and the apricot scarf, leaves no doubt."
- |
  

- So I'm vain?
- |
  

- I'm not deaf, is more like it.
- "And a bit of advice: if you're going to call someone vain, avoid lyrics like \"I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee."
- "\" What the pot calls the kettle, my dear."
- I will not pursue legal action, Carly, because I'm far too busy and, believe it or not, I still have fond memories of our time together, when you were still quite naive.
- |
  

- "I find naivet\xE9 enchanting."
- |
  

- It leads me to make promises.
- |
  

- As you know.
- |
  

- But I do hope that you try to think a bit more fairly before you record any other potential screeds.
- |
  

- Best of luck to you, regardless.
- With love from your vain muse,
- Mick Jagger or Warren Beatty or Kris Kristofferson or whoever the hell I am
