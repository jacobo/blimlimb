- The radical changes going on around me make me uncomfortable.
- I am unhappy about the way things are, but feel helpless to do anything about it.
- Shame is my dominant emotion.
- I feel very insecure and vulnerable.
- Others supposedly feel as I do, but whenever I turn on the TV it seems otherwise.
- At times, I wish I lived in a faraway country.
- I want to rebel against anyone in a position of authority.
- Social mobility is a fallacy.
- I find myself frequently watching sports for comfort.
- It's totally unfair that when I screw up I get in trouble but when my superiors do, nothing happens.
- What I represent is repugnant to foreign women.
- Flying is much more terrifying than it should be.
- When I talk to friends on the phone, I'm afraid someone is listening in.
- People tell me things will only improve after this, but I don't believe it.
- I constantly think the world is going to end.
- I really dislike the arrogant popular guy elected as my president.
- French is considered lame.
