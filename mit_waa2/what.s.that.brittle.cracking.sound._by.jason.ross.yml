- A monkey demolishing a rattan chair?
- A mummy playing soccer?
- A little girl breaking the seal on a pint of Teachers?
- A man enraged by his woman's deception stomping on the stuffed marlin from their honeymoon?
- The moment that no one on the football field will ever forget?
- A bear returning to the skeleton of a camper he mauled long ago and crushing the bones for marrow?
- Sasquatch?
- Ice cubes bursting in a gin and tonic?
- Sappers in the wire?
- An alien creature emerging from its encrusted egg sac?
- Gary Busey wiping his nose?

  A monkey demolishing a rattan chair?
  A mummy playing soccer?
  A little girl breaking the seal on a pint of Teachers?
  A man enraged by his woman's deception stomping on the stuffed marlin
  from their honeymoon?
  The moment that no one on the football field will ever forget?
  A bear returning to the skeleton of a camper he mauled long ago and
  crushing the bones for marrow?
  Sasquatch?
  Ice cubes bursting in a gin and tonic?
  Sappers in the wire?
  An alien creature emerging from its encrusted egg sac?
  Gary Busey wiping his nose?
