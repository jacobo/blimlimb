- "DAD: I don't think we should ever talk about feelings."
- "MOM: Never."
- |
  

- "DAD: I'll take the greatest number of photographs of her when she's in her most awkward stage, right in the depths of puberty."
- "MOM: Good idea."
- |
  

- I'll make sure to send them to all our immediate and all our somewhat distant family and friends.
- |
  

- Oh, and make sure you forget your camera the one night in her life that Billy Sherman talks to her, so that no proof exists of said event.
- "DAD: Got it."
- |
  

- "DAD: We should talk very loudly about the truth about Santa Claus."
- "MOM: Yes, and let's not make any attempt whatsoever to disguise Santa's handwriting from our own."
- |
  

- "MOM: Let's make sure we avoid the topic of sex so masterfully and so consistently that she begins to wonder if it's something made up by people on  TV ."
- "DAD: Good idea."
- |
  

- Let's also ignore the existence of any of her long-term boyfriends, no matter how harmless, awkward, and acne-prone they are.
- |
  

- "MOM: She should never have to worry about money, especially when she's young."
- "DAD: I agree."
- |
  

- That way, she can spend all her time worrying about us getting a divorce.
- |
  

- "DAD: When I teach her to ride a bike, I will tell her that my hand is on the seat, but then I will take it away just as she is getting the hang of it."
- "MOM: That will not turn out well."
- "DAD: No."
- |
  

- "MOM: I'll make sure to give her a haircut that matches mine."
- |
  

- Mine in 1972, that is.
- "DAD: Great."
- |
  

- I'll wear an awkward comb-over.
- |
  

- "DAD: I think I'll always be a little bit weirder than necessary around her friends."
- |
  

- Especially the "cool" ones who are just over to copy notes for Ms. Reardon's  AP  Physics midterm.
- "MOM: Sounds good."
- |
  

- I'll always talk one decibel louder than a normal person.
- |
  

- "DAD: She will beg us to get a dog for many, many years."
- "MOM: And I will repeatedly tell her how I am allergic to animal hair."
- "DAD: You will wear a fur coat."
- |
  

- "MOM: Whenever she does something that really upsets me, I'll always make sure to tell her that \"her grandmother is rolling over in her grave."
- "DAD: Even though we will cremate her."
- |
  

- "DAD: I will demonstrate a total lack of understanding of the proper grammatical way to use quotation marks, and sign every birthday card with \"Love."
- "MOM: That will keep her on her toes."
- |
  

- "MOM: I think the most important thing is that we will criticize her, no matter what she does or who she becomes."
- "DAD: And that she knows we criticize her just as much as we criticize each other."
- |
  

- "DAD: Let's not give her a little brother or sister."
- "MOM: No. That might function as some sort of coping mechanism."
- |
  

- "MOM: We can't take her on those classic but trite kid vacations that every other child in the Western world gets to experience, like trips to Disneyland."
- "DAD: No, for she will gain great popularity and respect from her second-grade classmates when she wears her \"I Went to Vermont and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt Made From 100% Recycled Compost-Heap Materials\" T-shirt."
- |
  

- "DAD: We should always give her what she wants."
- "MOM: That way, we can hold it against her when she's older and can finally provide for herself."
