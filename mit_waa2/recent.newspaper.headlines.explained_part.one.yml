  "Starr Wars"
  A little over a week ago, readers across the country saw this headline
  in their favorite newspapers and online magazines. When they saw this
  headline, many thought to themselves,  What does this headline
  mean?  To answer that question -- to "get into the heads" of the editors,
  as they say -- is the goal of this column.
  Upon first seeing the words "Starr Wars," it is tempting to appreciate
  them for purely aesthetic reasons, considering that they both have a's
  followed by r's and that, put together, they almost rhyme. It would be
  simple to assume the pretty words were just that, otherwise void of
  poesy. On further investigation, however, more is revealed.
  In order to piece together this puzzle, it's important first to know a
  few things about the United States political system: First, the federal
  government, which finds its seat in Washington, D.C., is structured
  around one predominant tenet, a concept known informally as "checks and
  balances" and outlined in a document titled  U.S. Constitution . To
  summarize, the checks and balances system ensures that the three
  branches of government -- judicial, executive, and legislative -- "check"
  each other's power, make sure each other is law-abiding, and thereby
  "balance" often disparate -- but healthily so -- forces and interests.
  Every so often, when a situation arises that stretches the ability of
  those that govern to place it into the constitutional template, one
  branch of government may take an extraordinary step and appoint a
  truth-seeking individual to ferret out verity in whatever way he or she
  deems appropriate. This is the case with Kenneth Starr (note the two
  r's; we'll come back to that later), a lawyer who was appointed by the
  legislative branch to be a  third  check on the executive branch -- in
  particular, to investigate the conduct of the leader of that branch,
  President Bill Clinton. There was concern that Clinton had been
  associated, many years prior, with a speculative land deal involving a
  river.
  For his work in this capacity, Starr is known in political circles as
  the "Independent Counsel" and is signified by "Starr" in the headline.
  (In the interest of brevity, headline writers will often use only one of
  the subject's two names; in this case, the surname.)
  Not finding evidence of foul play with regards to Mr. Clinton and the
  land deal, Mr. Starr exposed an extramarital affair of Mr. Clinton's
  and, along with the country's "media machine," succeeded in garnering
  another piquant example of what some consider the
   puritanical/titillating dichotomy  of U.S. culture. On Thursday
  November 19, Mr. Starr stated his findings to a legislative arm of the
  government, the House of Representatives.
  This is where the headline's dexterity comes in. (Headlines are widely
  considered good when their layers of meaning are not immediately
  recognizable but, upon being peeled away, ever more is discovered, like
  literary baklava.) "Starr Wars" doesn't only refer to Starr in the midst
  of wars ("War" is defined as an armed and hostile conflict, but is often
  used metaphorically and applied to verbal, literary, or metaphysical
  combat, as it is in this case -- these exceptional constitutional
  situations are often quite volatile), but has an interesting cinematic
  reference as well. When one renoves the second "r" on "Starr" one is
  left with "Star Wars," also the title of a 1977 science fiction film
  directed by George Lucas and starring Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and
  Peter Mayhew, in a breakthrough role. Perhaps best known for introducing
  the "Princess Leia 'do" -- a hairstyle worn by Fisher throughout the
  movie in which she center-parted her hair and coiled the two sides just
  above her ears -- it may also be remembered by Hollywood buffs for
  winning a number of industry awards ("Oscars") for technical
  achievement.
  In  Star Wars , the protagonists collaborate with sentient robots to
  battle an evil empire, spearheaded by a character known as Darth Vader.
  With "Starr Wars," headline writers were eliciting the movie's action
  and tumult, making an analogy between that and the situation that Starr
  found himself in last month, presenting his findings to a House that did
  not unanimously abet him.
  It is unclear whether or not a farther-reaching significance was
  attached to "Starr Wars" -- it is possible that not just the movie was
  being referred to, but also the many as-yet-unknown wars that may be
  going on up in the stars. After all, there are galaxies that we don't
  even know about, and they could be warring.
  The online magazine  Salon   not only employed the headline "Starr Wars"
  but also added a subordinate headline (a "subhead" or "subhed," in
  parlance). That subhead was "Democrats Strike Back." This subhead draws
  on the title of a sequel to  Star Wars  entitled  The Empire Strikes
  Back  and connects it with the combative reaction of a House faction --
  the Democrats -- to Mr. Starr and his findings. Democrats are the
  opposition party to the House-controlling Republicans. The  Salon  
  editor may have been using this phrase as well to evoke a negative
  connotation of Democrats -- "The Empire," after all, was Darth Vader's
  stronghold.
  Opposition and evil are not necessarily synonymic, because the primary
  agent is the opposition from the view of the opposition (i.e., one side
  is good, the other side is bad, but the labels "primary agent" and
  "opposition" reflect perspective, not discernment). Let us qualify that
  example. It has recently been hypothesized -- the jury is still out, one
  might say -- that if one side is good, the other side is not necessarily
  bad. There may exist the possibility that both sides have some good and
  bad; that both are good but disagree on process; and/or that both sides
  are deliberately deceiving the people they are speaking for
  ("constituents"), and are thereby manipulating the world around them for
  their own benefit. It can generally be assumed that the opposition is
  evil from the perspective of those they oppose, and vice versa.
  In this case, evil may not be the editorialization intended by the
  editors -- in fact, most U.S. media editors consider themselves to be
  against Republicans, and most vote for Democratic candidates, if only
  because they feel that, while there is little difference between the
  parties, they have a civic duty to vote and a third-party vote is a lost
  one. Here opposition is probably considered a good evil; the headline
  belies an affectionate "go get 'em" attitude on the part of  Salon.
  The fourth movie in the  Star Wars  series is due out next summer. In
  it, the unfortunate circumstances that led Darth Vader to the dark side
  will be depicted.
