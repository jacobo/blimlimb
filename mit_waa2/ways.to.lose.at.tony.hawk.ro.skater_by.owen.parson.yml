- Coming down off the quarter pipe, you nose-manual straight across the platform and ollie up to the rail, 50-50 for about 10 feet, then kickflip over to the pool ledge, darkslide around the pool five times, varial heelflip back onto the rail, and nose-grind it to the very end of the park, where you're viciously torn to shreds by a feral dinosaur.
- |
  

- Bogus!
- |
  

- While skating down an alleyway, you come across Trashcan Pete, the crackhead hobo.
- |
  

- "Pete tells you he's got a big problem: Officer Baconface is closing in on his secret stash of crack rocks!"
- |
  

- You must lip-trick off the five big sites in order to distract Officer Baconface and help Trashcan Pete escape to safety.
- |
  

- You agree to use your sick vert skills to save the day, but, as you turn to leave, Pete mistakes you for a griffin and stabs you to death.
- |
  

- After launching off the vert ramp, your board achieves sufficient velocity to enter a low earth orbit.
- |
  

- Trapped in space, forever falling, you rack up a score modifier that ranks in the trillions, but you fail to stick the landing after your frozen corpse disintegrates upon re-entry.
- |
  

- You rush to the neighborhood skate shop to modify your board, only to find that Ollie, the proprietor, has closed shop for the weekend.
- |
  

- You let yourself in through an unlocked window, certain that friendly Ollie won't mind if you leave behind the money for your purchases.
- |
  

- Without Ollie's advice, however, you find that you cannot decide whether you want looser trucks for better turns or tighter trucks for stability.
- |
  

- Unable to decide, you go quite mad.
- |
  

- Ollie finds your body Monday morning after you hang yourself with a spool of grip tape.
- |
  

- You catch a bus ride over to the old military base, where no one seems to question your presence as you pop-shove it over Black Hawk helicopters and hurricane-grind through the soldiers' mess.
- |
  

- Hours pass and eventually you accept a mission to pop a backflip over a four-star general.
- |
  

- "Your sick moves are interpreted as hostile action by the MPs, who pistol-whip you behind the aircraft hangar and ship your board to Guant\xE1namo for interrogation."
- |
  

- Your father, outraged at your flouting of his generation's values, bursts into your room.
- |
  

- Bellowing nonsense, the familiar scent of cheap whiskey on his breath, he snaps your board in half.
- |
  

- You briefly consider purchasing a new one, but the sting of your father's belt leads you to abandon the idea.
- |
  

- You drop skating altogether and devote yourself to your studies, eventually graduating magna cum laude.
- |
  

- Your father dies of alcohol poisoning a week later, and, on the plane back from the funeral, you meet Sarah.
- |
  

- The two of you get married, settle down in a nearby suburb, and produce three children.
- |
  

- "You're not sure how you're going to make ends meet with your office job: the hours are long and the pay is low, but you feel confident that hard work will see you through."
- |
  

- On your way out of the team-building seminar, however, you trip on an exposed stone and totally beef it all over the pavement.
- |
  

- Combo breaker!
- |
