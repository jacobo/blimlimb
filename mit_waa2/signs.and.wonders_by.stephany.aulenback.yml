- I was on the sofa when my cat climbed in the window, sat down on the rag mat in front of me, and opened her mouth.
- |
  

- A fat grasshopper jumped out and away across the plank floorboards.
- |
  

- Right back out the window.
- |
  

- Five in the morning, I woke myself up with a scream that roused the rest of the house, too.
- |
  

- No bad dreams, no reason, just this top-of-the-lungs scream.
- |
  

- We all went around looking over our shoulders for a week.
- |
  

- "I usually tell it like this: \"I woke up because someone was screaming, and when I woke up, it was me."
- |
  

- September, there was this swarm of ladybugs at my parents' house.
- |
  

- There were hundreds of them, crawling all over the front windows and back porch.
- |
  

- My mother kept saying that ladybugs mean wishes.
- |
  

- You'd open the screen door and by the time you'd shut it, there'd be dozens crawling inside.
- |
  

- So we all made wishes that month.
- |
  

- You couldn't leave the house or get back in without killing some of them.
- |
  

- We were sitting on an outcropping of rocks on the edge of a cliff, overlooking the ocean.
- |
  

- A hundred feet in front of us there was a tree that had grown up out of the side of the cliff &#151; it looked dead, like it had been hit by lightning.
- |
  

- Perched on the very top of this tree was this bird, I don't know what kind.
- |
  

- It had a long beak and wings that, when unfurled, were bright orange.
- |
  

- We were sitting there watching it preen when another bird just like it flew over and joined it.
- |
  

- The bird we'd been watching, I guess it was a male, promptly jumped on the second bird's back, and they mated.
- |
  

- When the male bird jumped off, the female's back was rumpled and a little feather was sticking off her.
- |
  

- I pointed this out and as I was talking, a rising wind caught the feather and lifted it away.
- |
  

- We watched as the wind carried the feather into the sky.
- |
  

- Then, in a slow curve, the feather fell right into my hand.
- |
  

- Not a word of this is a lie.
- |
  

- I cracked open a fortune cookie, pulled out the slip of paper inside, and saw that it was blank.
- |
  

- Both sides.
- |
  

- I double-checked.
- |
  

- This can't be a good sign, I thought.
- |
  

- "\"This can't be a good sign,\""
- |
  

- I said to my dinner companions.
- |
  

- Nothing bad happened.
- |
  

- I mean, nothing bad has happened yet.
