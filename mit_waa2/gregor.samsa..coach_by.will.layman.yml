- C'mon, now.
- |
  

- C'mon, let's take care of the ball, now.
- |
  

- Look to post up.
- |
  

- Look for Steve in the paint&#8212;c'mon.
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- Now, box out!
- |
  

- Box!
- "\"Stands\""
- |
  

- All right, drop back&#8212;zone trap, blue!
- |
  

- Arms out, guys&#8212;cut off the passing lanes!
- |
  

- Freaking BOX OUT!
- Come on!
- |
  

- What's goin' on, now?
- |
  

- Aren't you guys even listening to me?
- |
  

- Jesus!
- Throws clipboard to ground, wriggles off sport coat and subtly extrudes a greenish film from his salivary glands.
- They're gonna press the inbounds pass, fellas!
- |
  

- C'mon, now&#8212;stack up and break!
- |
  

- Let's go!
- The ball, squirting loose, bangs into Coach Samsa's chair, knocking him to his side and then, in the slow rocking motion of an upended dome, onto his exoskeletal back.
- I can't believe it!
- |
  

- Did you guys come to play or just to mess around?
- |
  

- Do we run these plays each day in practice, or am I dreaming?
- |
  

- Actually, I'm in a freaking nightmare!
- |
  

- I'm dying here.
- |
  

- Time out!
- |
  

- Someone get me a towel.
- |
  

- Time out!
- More rocking back and forth, then incessant guttural clicking until halftime.
- |
  

- MORE MONOLOGUES

  C'mon, now. C'mon, let's take care of the ball, now. Look to post up. Look for Steve in the paint&#8212;c'mon. Yes. Now, box out! Box!\n\
  \"Stands\" by using front legs to climb up a metal-legged chair to a 45-degree angle, rising several feet in the air&#8212;a good five, six feet if you count the gesticulating antennae, sniffing wildly, which pick up the scent of a potential mate.\n\
  All right, drop back&#8212;zone trap, blue! Arms out, guys&#8212;cut off the passing lanes! Freaking BOX OUT!\n\
  Come on! What's goin' on, now? Aren't you guys even listening to me? Jesus!\n\
