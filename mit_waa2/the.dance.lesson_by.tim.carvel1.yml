- Listen to the beat of the music.
- |
  

- Oh, for God's sake.
- |
  

- Then turn some music on, will you?
- |
  

- You were going to try to dance without any music playing?
- |
  

- What's wrong with you?
- |
  

- I don't know.
- |
  

- Something lively.
- |
  

- Something with a beat to it.
- |
  

- No, not that.
- |
  

- Not that either.
- |
  

- Fine, that'll do.
- |
  

- Okay, now listen to the beat of the music.
- |
  

- Clap along to it.
- |
  

- No, that's not it - you're going too fast.
- |
  

- No, now you're going too slowly.
- |
  

- That's it, you've got-no, you've lost it again.
- |
  

- "How about this: Instead of clapping, just try to move your feet a bit to the music."
- |
  

- Just shuffle them at a pace that seems right to you.
- |
  

- Good, good, you've got it.
- |
  

- That looks nice.
- |
  

- Let's take this up a notch now.
- |
  

- Start moving your arms around to the music.
- |
  

- OH MY GOD.
- |
  

- STOP MOVING YOUR ARMS THIS INSTANT.
- |
  

- What was that?
- |
  

- What were you doing?
- |
  

- What the fuck was that supposed to be?
- |
  

- I told you to move your arms, not flap them.
- |
  

- You looked like a total dork.
- |
  

- "First things first: When you move your arms, bend your elbows a bit."
- |
  

- You don't have to hold them perfectly straight when you move them.
- |
  

- Just bend your elbows a little.
- |
  

- Bend them.
- |
  

- You  can  bend your elbows, can't you?
- |
  

- There.
- |
  

- No, you're not supposed to lock your elbows at a perfect right angle, either.
- |
  

- You look like an organ grinder's monkey.
- |
  

- Just relax a bit.
- |
  

- Relax.
- |
  

- RELAX!
- |
  

- So it's my fault that you can't relax?
- |
  

- I don't think I've been "screaming at" you. I think I may have gotten a little  agitated . I may have  raised my voice  a bit. But that doesn't constitute screaming.
- |
  

- Look, I'm sorry.
- |
  

- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- You're right.
- |
  

- I was wrong, you were right.
- |
  

- I know that teaching you to dance was my idea, and you've been a really good sport.
- |
  

- I'm a jerk.
- |
  

- I admit it.
- |
  

- But I only yell at you because I want so badly to see you succeed - you  know  that.
- |
  

- C'mon.
- |
  

- Let's start over.
- |
  

- Let's go back to where you were just shuffling your feet to the music.
- |
  

- Good, good, good.
- |
  

- You're doing great.
- |
  

- Just great.
- |
  

- You look terrific.
- |
  

- Now, let's try moving your arms a little to the music - just sway them back and forth a bit.
- |
  

- Um, okay, okay, that's.
- |
  

- That's really  nice .
- |
  

- But, you know, like I said before, you're allowed to bend your elbows just a bit.
- |
  

- That's  super .
- |
  

- Just super.
- |
  

- You keep this up, and you'll be dancing great in no time.
- |
  

- Now, try and vary your movements just a bit.
- |
  

- Just go with the flow of the music.
- |
  

- Improvise a little.
- |
  

- You know, do what feels natural.
- |
  

- I'm sorry.
- |
  

- I didn't mean to laugh.
- |
  

- It's just that, when I told you do what felt natural, I had no idea that what felt natural to you would be looking like.
- |
  

- Why are you crying?
- |
  

- Oh, for Christ's sake, it's always like this with you, isn't it?
- |
  

- I try and do something nice for you, and all of a sudden, you're all in tears because it hasn't turned out the way you planned.
- |
  

- This is the thanks I get?
- |
  

- "Look: I'm trying to help you."
- |
  

- I knew you'd have more fun if you knew how to dance, and so I agreed to take the time to teach you - time that I could have spent somewhere else, somewhere  fun , hanging out with people who don't burst into tears for no reason.
- |
  

- People who know how to take a fucking joke.
- |
  

- I had other plans for today, but instead, here I am, being guilt-tripped by you for, like, the millionth time.
- |
  

- You  know  I don't need this.
- |
  

- You  know  I've got trust issues I've been working through.
- |
  

- But don't let that stop you.
- |
  

- No - you go right on ahead.
- |
  

- Keep on crying, making me feel like a heel for trying to help you.
- |
  

- You're damn right, you're sorry.
- |
  

- Because I don't want to teach you, that's why.
- |
  

- Now you're going to dance?
- |
  

- Without any input from me?
- |
  

- Go ahead.
- |
  

- Dance.
- |
  

- I don't care.
- |
  

- I'm not watching you.
- |
  

- "Okay, one quick pointer: You're still not bending your arms."
- |
  

- Just a little.
- |
  

- Just bend them a little.
- |
  

- No, that's a jig.
- |
  

- You're doing a jig.
- |
  

- Oh, for God's sake.
