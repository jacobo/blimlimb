- This is a song I wrote called "I Just Gotta Hit That Dusty Road.
- "\" I hope you like it."

- "Here we go now:"
- And I woke up one morning feeling blue.
- Truthfully, I didn't know what to do,
- "So I turned to my wife and said: \"Woman, I gotta hit the road."
- "I told her: \"Woman, I just gotta hit that road."
- One of the Lexus's tires blew out just around 6.
- Isn't this something I could fix?
- What would Charlie Patton do?
- AAA came right away, sent an entire crew.
- Limped into a Motel 6 in Raleigh round midnight.
- Called the ol' lady.

- "She told me: \"Boy, you ain't coming back\x97you heard right."
- "I said: \"Maybe this life ain't for me."
- |
  

- "I miss the kids and I miss you\x97\""
- "And she replied: \"Shut the fuck up."

- Now what was I supposed to do?
- |
  

- Return to my job as a corporate-tax specialist for a midsize law firm in northern Virginia?
- |
  

- Give up on this lifelong dream of becoming a singer/songwriter troubadour, a ramblin' man, laying down the miles, crisscrossing the back roads of this magnificent nation, carrying nothing with me except for my hopes and dreams?
- |
  

- Don't think so, thank you very much!
- |
  

- Four, three, two, one .
- |
  

- Tried to earn some coin by singing my songs.
- "Audiences didn't take too kindly, but don't get me wrong:"
- They threw me some change, a nickel here, a quarter there,
- A dollar one time outside a Fuddruckers in Lewes, Delaware.
- Went a little crackers, around the 21st of June.
- Don't remember much.
- |
  

- I was dancing to my own tune.
- Ended up in the backyard of my first serious girl.
- "\"Hey, whaddya say?"
- "\" I screamed."
- |
  

- "\"Let's give it another whirl!"
- |
  

- Spoken)
- Perhaps I should also mention that I was crouched on her roof, wearing only my socks, and howling at the moon.
- |
  

- And .
- |
  

- "\"What the hell's happened to you?"
- "\" my girl asked, taken aback."
- "Said I: \"Had to follow my dreams!"
- |
  

- Trying to break out of the pack!
- "\"You must be going through a crisis,\""
- |
  

- She then, I think, called her Marine husband in Iraq, though I can't be sure.
- Sold the Lexus for a can of Pringles and a new guitar.
- Got drunk on homemade hooch and followed the stars.
- Went on doing my writing, went on doing my singing.
- Played for a group of teens outside Baltimore, took a horrendous beating.
- |
  

- Spoken)
- I would now play a melodious guitar solo, but this sling prevents me from doing so.
- |
  

- Also, I lost the guitar.
- |
  

- Plus, I never really learned.
- |
  

- "Count it down now:"
- Slept the next few months in an abandoned car.
- Woke up each morning next to a whore sporting a Z-shaped scar.
- Walked across the country, dispensing, through my songs, advice,
- Like with this little ditty about the 47-year-old with the terrible case of head lice.
- |
  

- Spoken)
- You might have noticed the plastic shower cap that I'm wearing, right?
- |
  

- It's for the Nix shampoo.
- |
  

- Takes a few hours to settle.
- |
  

- Where was I? See .
- |
  

- Fell into a deep depression.
- |
  

- Where I'd sleep was anyone's guess.
- How the hell did I get myself into this goddamn mess?
- I'm no blues singer, just a middle-aged man with a law degree.
- "Called my wife one day (collect) and had her listen to my plea:"
- "\"Woman, I think I done made a tremendous mistake."
- Just wanted to play the blues, but your boy's ready for a break!
- All I've ever wished for, really, was to become B.B.
- |
  

- King.
- Now I'm just an agin' lawyer sufferin' from a rare strain of gangrene.
- "My woman, she told me: \"I just found myself a new man."
- |
  

- Actually, that's not true.
- In all honesty, I don't want to stay married to you.
- "And I cried: \"Woman\x97\""
- "And she replied: \"Shut the fuck up."
- "\"  (Repeat)"
- |
  

- Spoken)
- Can you hear me way in the back?
- |
  

- The man talking on his cell phone?
- |
  

- OK, I'll sing a little louder .
- |
  

- If there's a moral to this blues song, it goes a little like this .
- |
  

- I always yearned to become a blues singer, hit that dusty road and catch that last train.
- See, I had no intention of pissing my life down the goddamn metaphorical drain.
- Sometimes it's best not to follow your dreams .
- |
  

- My last 25 meals have all involved ice cream.
- |
  

- Spoken)
- I hope y'all have enjoyed my ode to the wanderin' life .
- |
  

- It's been one hell of a ride, folks!
- |
  

- I'll be working, through the end of this month, and perhaps every month, as a busboy around the corner at the Chuck E. Cheese's here in Daytona Beach.
- |
  

- If any of you have any spare change, or maybe a few curly fries, I'd most greatly appreciate it .
- |
  

- I sure as shucks would!
- |
  

- Or a place to stay.
- |
  

- Or a ride back to northern Virginia.
- |
  

- I really do miss my family and my washing machine.
- |
  

- It surely has been a pleasure, and I thank you all very much.
- |
  

- For the record, I also miss my 27-inch Panasonic flat-screen.
- |
  

- God bless.
