- CAMP PREVIEWS ONE AND TWO.
- BY  JEFF JOHNSON
- |
  

- Camp Tickles
- Located 32 miles south of Akron, Ohio, on County Trunk R, Camp Tickles is essentially a clown camp for clown prodigies ages 7 to 11.
- |
  

- While clowning and clownlike activities make up a lion's share of camp time, Camp Tickles is also a self-esteem-boosting "challenge camp.
- "\" Challenge One involves the cabins, which are constructed in the camp kitchen and the camp's great lawn over the first few days and are freestanding structures made of marshmallow and sticks."
- |
  

- Campers (in groups of five) do not and will not sleep until they have baked and sculpted their own cabins.
- |
  

- Blueprints are provided by counselors on the first day of camp.
- |
  

- Challenge Two involves the refurbishing and restoration of several turn-of-the-century coin-operated (nickels) games in the "
- Coney Island" style.
- |
  

- Campers (in groups of 43) will liberally apply sunscreen, then ride on the back of eastern-bound flatbed trucks to Camp Tickles' warehouse near Coney Island in New York, where they will be given several tools and instructions.
- |
  

- Some Internet searches for older instruction manuals will be conducted, and some direction will be provided by Lloyd McAfee, restoration specialist.
- |
  

- Challenge Three involves hole-patching of several Ohio roads and adjacencies.
- |
  

- Campers (in groups of three) will be provided with red wagons, tar, shovels, levels, and maps of pothole-riddled areas, most of which are within a 14-mile radius of Camp Tickles.
- |
  

- Campers should ask area farmers and business owners for water, or bring canteens.
- |
  

- Campers will be rewarded for completing challenges at a ceremony in the last week of camp.
