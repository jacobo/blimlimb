- PRNewswire/&nbsp;-- Meganet Corporation, who challenged Microsoft, Intel, Dell, AT&T, NCR and many other high tech companies with their unbreakable Virtual Matrix Encryption, have announced today the result of 13 years of Research & Development in the prime number testing area&nbsp;-- the world's first and only POLYNOMIAL TIME, 100% DETERMINISTIC PRIMALITY TESTING.

- It is NOT a probabilistic test like the  other algorithms in the market, but 100% deterministic.

- Those results are unheard of.
- |
  

- The 1,000 bits test on a Sparc II workstation takes 5 Minutes and it is still only PROBABILISTIC.
- |
  

- The gap in time is much greater for larger bit sizes.
- The major breakthrough is solving a 400 year old mathematical problem&nbsp;--  how to positively identify a prime number without spending exponential time in dividing the number by all the primes up to its root.
- |
  

- The solution Meganet Corporation have developed is based on a newly designed Mathematical Sequence called the T-Sequence.
- |
  

- Once a number is transformed to the T-Sequence, its quadratic residue has definitive characteristics if it's a prime number that can be easily determined in polynomial time by performing a binary decomposition.
- Meganet Corporation would like to emphasize that there is a 100% mathematical proof behind their T-Sequence, and further, it is a complete working product tested successfully on over 1.3 million numbers without a single mistake.
- Meganet Corporation is seeking for companies interested in this algorithm which generates large industrial grade prime numbers at record speeds, and would be glad to demonstrate the technology to any interested party on request.
- This latest development further establishes the status of Meganet Corporation as a leader in the Data Security & Encryption field.

- Meganet  Corporation is the developer of Virtual Matrix Encryption, which is the strongest available encryption product in the market, including the PROVEN unbreakable Virtual Matrix Algorithm and a 1 MILLION BIT SYMMETRIC KEY.

  THE No. 2 MOST CENSORED PRESS RELEASE OF 1998:
  Major Worldwide Mathematical Breakthrough --
  Meganet Corporation
  Developed Fast 100% Deterministic Prime Number Testing
  It is the Only Deterministic Algorithm in the World to Work in
  Polynomial
  Time.
  TARZANA, Calif., Dec. 30 /PRNewswire/&nbsp;-- Meganet Corporation, who
  challenged Microsoft, Intel, Dell, AT&T, NCR and many other high tech
  companies with their unbreakable Virtual Matrix Encryption, have
  announced
  today the result of 13 years of Research & Development in the prime
  number
  testing area&nbsp;-- the world's first and only POLYNOMIAL TIME, 100%
  DETERMINISTIC PRIMALITY TESTING. It is NOT a probabilistic test like the
  
  other algorithms in the market, but 100% deterministic. The algorithm is
  
  in POLYNOMIAL TIME, therefore much faster than even the probabilistic
  algorithms. Meganet Corporation have implemented the algorithm in an
  ANSI
  C application running on a single CPU 450 MHz PC Computer. Some sample
  results:
  1,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 0.5 Sec 
  2,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 1 Sec 
  3,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 3 Sec 
  4,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 8 Sec 
  5,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 15 Sec 
  6,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 26 Sec 
  7,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 41 Sec 
  8,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 1:01 Min 
  9,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 1:27 Min 
  10,000 bits primality test&nbsp;-- 1:58 Min
  Those results are unheard of. The 1,000 bits test on a Sparc II
  workstation takes 5 Minutes and it is still only PROBABILISTIC. The gap
  in
  time is much greater for larger bit sizes.
  The major breakthrough is solving a 400 year old mathematical problem&nbsp;--
  
  how to positively identify a prime number without spending exponential
  time in dividing the number by all the primes up to its root. The
  solution
  Meganet Corporation have developed is based on a newly designed
  Mathematical Sequence called the T-Sequence. Once a number is
  transformed
  to the T-Sequence, its quadratic residue has definitive characteristics
  if
  it's a prime number that can be easily determined in polynomial time by
  performing a binary decomposition.
  Meganet Corporation would like to emphasize that there is a 100%
  mathematical proof behind their T-Sequence, and further, it is a
  complete
  working product tested successfully on over 1.3 million numbers without
  a
  single mistake.
  Meganet Corporation is seeking for companies interested in this
  algorithm
  which generates large industrial grade prime numbers at record speeds,
  and
  would be glad to demonstrate the technology to any interested party on
  request.
  This latest development further establishes the status of Meganet
  Corporation as a leader in the Data Security & Encryption field. Meganet
  
  Corporation is the developer of Virtual Matrix Encryption, which is the
  strongest available encryption product in the market, including the
  PROVEN
  unbreakable Virtual Matrix Algorithm and a 1 MILLION BIT SYMMETRIC KEY.
  The retail product is sold nationwide for over 8 months now, and the
  ongoing $1,200,000.00 challenge to break VME is at it's 8th month with
  no
  challenger. The challenges emphasizes Meganet Corporation's confidence
  that VME is an unbreakable algorithm.
