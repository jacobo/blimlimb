- Twelve men sit around a conference-room table.

- All but one are older, distinguished, wearing suits and large cowboy hats.

- At the end of the table, the leader is presenting a cowboy hat to a younger, unhatted man.

- Or maybe "We'll just call you 'pardner.

- Put it there, pardner.

- Two guys are sitting on a desert island with their backs against a single palm tree.
- "\"I miss blogging."
- Or, no, wait, maybe one of them is standing near the water with a bottle at his feet, reading a letter.

- "\"It's from the former treasurer of Nigeria."
- "\" You know, making fun of those fraud e-mails."

- Or maybe something else involving the Internet, which you don't get on desert islands.

- "\"It's a good deal on vi_jgra\""

- "\"I wonder what Google is doing."

- Four stylish women in a cluster at a cocktail party, all but one eyeing a handsome man in conversation nearby.
- "\"Well, I'm just not that into him, either."
- Or some other recent culture reference.
- |
  

- Or something involving wine, or Europe.
- |
  

- A small, timid man faces his large, sinister-looking boss across an enormous desk.
- "\"Jenkins, I've decided to kill you and eat you for lunch."
- |
  

- Just kidding.
- |
  

- What do you want?
- Maybe too dark?
- |
  

- A doctor is talking to a man in an exam room.
- They have these every time.
- |
  

- Something about the medical bill, or insurance.
- |
  

- Or maybe the patient could have duck feet or antennae and there's a joke about that.
- |
  

- "\"Yes, Mr. Martin, that  is  an odd side effect."
- "\" That's good."
- |
  

- Should be simple.
- |
  

- Two guys hanging on the wall in a dungeon talking to a guard with a whip, who says something funny.
- "Or, what's the other one\x97in the desert?"
- |
  

- Yeah, two guys crawling in the hot sand, desperate for water, their clothes shredded, sun beating down, vultures circling overhead.
- |
  

- But funny.
