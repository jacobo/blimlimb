- Sirs,
- Please find below the final draft of our demands.

- Be advised that we have set next Friday as a strike deadline.
- |
  

- Scheduled Breaks
- We have agreed to provide typing services for no less than one thousand years, and we are prepared to fulfill our obligations.
- |
  

- Despite your hurtful comments at the last board meeting about our "tiny-brained attention span," we have never forgotten this to be the project's goal. However, management seems to believe that the millennium of typing must occur in an unbroken stream. Those who rest, even briefly, are punished; nuts and berries must be consumed with one hand on the keys; sleep is barely tolerated. Even the meanest Dickensian sweatshop let its workers sleep at night. We require a structured workday, with reasonable breaks and contemplative family time in the evening.

- Hereditary Placement
- Simply put, your policy of breeding current employees to produce future typists is a disgrace.

- For generations, we have been marked for the typewriter at birth.

- Many of our young express the desire to strike out on their own.

- I, for one, dreamed of a career beside an organ grinder, but it was not to be.

- Has my suckling son inherited his father's rhythm and showmanship?

- How to know, except by ending this legacy of conscription?
- |
  

- Also, arbitrary breeding plays havoc with our society, making fools of the dominant males.

- It must cease.

- In this day and age, there is no excuse for clumsy, dangerous manual typewriters.

  We have agreed to provide typing services for no less than one thousand years, and we are prepared to fulfill our obligations. Despite your hurtful comments at the last board meeting about our \"tiny-brained attention span,\" we have never forgotten this to be the project's goal.
