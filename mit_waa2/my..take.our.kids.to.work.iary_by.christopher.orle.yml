- My father has a tuft of blood-soaked toilet paper fixed to his cheek like a small red carnation.
- |
  

- His suit coat is bunched up tightly around his shoulders.
- |
  

- Up ahead, in the stalled traffic, a tractor-trailer is letting out some thick nasty fumes.
- "\"Dad, you've got toilet paper on your cheek."
- He feels around and tears it off, grimacing.
- |
  

- Blood trickles down his chin.
- |
  

- "\"Late again,\""
- |
  

- We cut through a room of copiers and office machines.
- |
  

- At one machine a woman glances from my father to a clock over the doorway.
- |
  

- We pass through a room of coffee pots and microwave ovens and enter a maze of beige walls, arriving at last at my father's cubicle.
- |
  

- Inside there is a computer and a filing cabinet and a phone and stacks of manila folders.
- |
  

- There are some old embarrassing photos of me in a cowboy suit and one or two of my mother.
- |
  

- "\"Sit here,\""
- |
  

- "\"Be right back."
- |
  

- Need coffee.
- "\"Can I get juice?"
- My father thinks this over.
- |
  

- "\"Juice."
- |
  

- Sure.
- |
  

- We might have juice.
- |
  

- Still waiting for my juice.
- |
  

- About ten minutes ago a woman stopped by and asked me my name and how old I was.
- |
  

- She seemed nice.
- |
  

- She asked me what I was doing and I told her nothing.
- |
  

- Just drawing on this pad of paper.
- |
  

- She smiled and wrote something down in a black binder and briskly walked away.
- |
  

- A few minutes later the telephone shouted my father's name.
- "\"Howard!"
- I started.
- "\"He's not here,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"Oh,\""
- |
  

- "\"Who's this?"
- "\"Chris."
- "\"Chris, will you bring me the Stenson file?"
- |
  

- Pronto.
- I looked around on my father's desk, but I couldn't see anything called the Stenson file.
- |
  

- I told the telephone this, but it pretended not to hear.
- |
  

- "\"Sorry it took so long,\""
- |
  

- He has forgotten my juice.
- "\"Ran into my boss and we had to go over some things."
- "\"The Stenson file?"
- "\"Yeah."
- |
  

- How'd you know?
- I shrug and go back to my picture.
- |
  

- I have found some red and green and yellow highlighters in a desk drawer and I am hard at work on a rainbow.
- "\"That's a really nice rainbow,\""
- |
  

- Then, "Ah, here it is.
- "\" He picks up the coffee mug I gave him for Father's Day, the one with World's Best Dad on it, and says he'll be right back."
- |
  

- A nice, pretty woman introduces herself as Carol and brings me a can of Minute Maid.
- |
  

- "\"So, you're Chris?"
- "\" she says."
- |
  

- "\"Do you like computer games?"
- "\"Sure."
- She brings up Minesweeper on the computer screen.
- "\"Just don't let anyone catch you playing that during work hours,\""
- |
  

- I don't get the joke.
- |
  

- I thought she meant real computer games.
- |
  

- My father returns.
- |
  

- "\"Sorry,\""
- |
  

- "\"Just found out I have a lunch meeting with some clients."
- |
  

- I wanted to take you across the street to Fridays, but.
- |
  

- Are you hungry?
- |
  

- "\"Yeah."
- "\"Okay,\""
- |
  

- "\"I'll see if Carol can bring you a burger from Lardees."
- |
  

- And some fries and a Coke.
- |
  

- How does that sound?
- "\"All right."
- "\"Yeah."
- |
  

- I got this lunch meeting.
- |
  

- You haven't seen the Stenson file lying around have you?
- "\"No.\""
- "\"Never mind."
- |
  

- I think I know where it is.
- |
  

- I'm really starting to get hungry when Carol comes by with the burger and fries but no Coke.
- |
  

- "\"Here you go,\""
- |
  

- "\"Tell your father he owes me."
- "\"Owes you?"
- "\"Yeah."
- |
  

- Big time.
- Carol looks off into space.
- |
  

- She says, "So, what do think of where your father works?
- "\"It's okay, I guess."
- "\"Yeah."
- |
  

- I guess,"
- |
  

- "\"Remember what you're supposed to tell him?"
- "\"He owes you."
- "\"Damn right,\""
- |
  

- My father returns from lunch looking pale and tired, muttering to himself.
- |
  

- He looks at me distantly for a moment, then he says, "I guess today hasn't been much fun for you.
- I shrug.
- "\"It's these deadlines,\""
- |
  

- "\"We've got everything going on at once."
- |
  

- The boss thought he was so smart, cramming a whole year's activities into two weeks&nbsp;&#151;"
- I swivel in my chair.
- "\"Anyway, look out."
- |
  

- I need to use the computer.
- I get up so my father can sit down.
- |
  

- I look at the clock.
- |
  

- In another thirty minutes school would be out.
- |
  

- My father comes back with a cup of coffee and says, "I'm going to have to work late.
- |
  

- Do you have something you can do?
- "\"Not really."
- He frowns.
- |
  

- "\"There might be a TV in the AV room."
- |
  

- You could probably watch that if you're quiet.
- |
  

- Yeah.
- The AV room is basically a big closet full of TVs and VCRs and DVDs.
- |
  

- After a few minutes of cursing and tracing cables, my father gets the TV working.
- |
  

- I sit on the floor on some old cables and watch Batman cartoons.
- |
  

- My father promises to bring me something from the vending machines later and closes the door.
- |
  

- After a few minutes the lights go off.
- |
  

- When I panic and jump up, they come back on.
- |
  

- When they go off again, I try not to move so they stay off.
- |
  

- I make a game of being still.
- |
  

- My father wakes me up.
- |
  

- "\"Ready to go, buddy?"
- "\"Yeah."
- It takes me a while to remember where I am.
- |
  

- Then I remember I'm in a closet with a bunch of TVs.
- |
  

- My father turns off the TV and locks the door.
- We go out the same way we came in, through the back way.
- |
  

- In the copier room we pass the same woman we saw coming in.
- |
  

- She looks at us and her eyes go automatically to the clock above the door.
- |
  

- As we slip out the back exit I look back at the woman.
- |
  

- She grins at me.
- We drive home in silence.
- |
  

- Once we're across the bridge, the traffic begins to thin out.
- |
  

- I turn to my father, hunched at the wheel.
- "\"Thanks for taking me to work."
- "\"Forget about it,\""
- |

  8:06 a.m. "Late again," my father mutters as we hurry down a long beige hallway through a back door. We cut through a room of copiers and office machines. At one machine a woman glances from my father to a clock over the doorway. We pass through a room of coffee pots and microwave ovens and enter a maze of beige walls, arriving at last at my father's cubicle. Inside there is a computer and a filing cabinet and a phone and stacks of manila folders. There are some old embarrassing photos of me in a cowboy suit and one or two of my mother. "Sit here," my father says, patting the back of a chair. "Be right back. Need coffee."
  "Can I get juice?"
  My father thinks this over. "Juice. Sure. We might have juice."

  8:45 a.m. Still waiting for my juice. About ten minutes ago a woman stopped by and asked me my name and how old I was. She seemed nice. She asked me what I was doing and I told her nothing.
