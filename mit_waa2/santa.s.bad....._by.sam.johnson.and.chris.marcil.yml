- Dear Children of the World,
- I bet you never expected Santa to write to  you !
- |
  

- Are you being good little boys and girls?
- |
  

- I sure hope so, because I'm going to be coming to your town this Christmas!
- |
  

- If our reorganization plan we're working out with a consortium of EU finance ministers goes through, that is.
- Now, you may have heard, "There is no Santa," or "It doesn't matter if you're good or bad, " or "Santa's first two quarters of 2008 were so out of line with expectations that only a massive bailout will allow him to meet current cash-flow obligations." Well, if you've heard one of your "friends" say that, maybe he or she's not  really  your friend. Maybe he or she's just a little 7-year-old speculator who shorted our stock (listed as "Touch of Class Toy Delivery GmbH").
- The fact is I  do  exist.
- |
  

- It  is  important to be good.
- |
  

- "And Santa's business environment  has  been challenging, for the following reasons:"
- Increased expenses.
- |
  

- The price of feed for my flying reindeer has almost doubled since a year ago.
- |
  

- And the air conditioning at the North Pole, which I purchased as a gag gift during the cash-rich '90s, has actually had to be turned on more than once this summer.
- Mission creep.
- |
  

- Santa always says that a good boy or girl doesn't make excuses, but, just to clarify, it was the advice of my investment bankers to go public, which forced Santa to concentrate on deal-making at the expense of his core mission.
- |
  

- "It's in that context that my agreement to be a lead sponsor of the Beijing Olympics should be understood\x97in my excitement at the potential of bringing the concept of a happy Christmas morning to the Chinese market, I forgot that Hu Jintao and the rest of the Chinese leadership were widely considered to be naughty."
- Salary inflation.
- |
  

- I'm not talking about Santa's salary.
- |
  

- Seeing the smiles of the faces of happy children is payment enough for me.
- |
  

- Although, despite what critics say, my compensation package is not out of line compared to someone like Uncle Sam, especially considering I no longer have the military-contracting sideline he has.
- |
  

- What's killing Santa is the unconscionable demands of the elves.
- |
  

- Do you know that if Santa supplies them, as they ask, with a  fourth  meal (they call it a "snack," but let's not kid ourselves), it might literally end Christmas?
- I know a lot of you boys and girls (especially you, Hunter Davis!
- |
  

- "\"Gee, Santa, what does any of this have to do with me?"
- "\" I'm glad you asked, because this is the important part."
- |
  

- Though I'm still totally committed to providing a satisfying yuletide experience for every child, Christmas is going to be just a little bit different this year.
- For one thing, all deliveries in a region will be made to a single, nonsectarian community drop site.
- |
  

- This is something we've been meaning to do for years.
- |
  

- It's easier on the reindeer, it'll eliminate the ever-spiraling cost of stuck-in-chimney insurance, and it's a great way to reduce our footprint.
- Also new this year will be your opportunity to choose your own gift!
- |
  

- The No. 1 complaint I hear from kids is "Why didn't you bring me what I asked for, Santa?
- "\" (Sound familiar, Jenny Cooper?"
- |
  

- Sometimes it's a feasibility issue to do with the size or cost of the present, or with the complicated international rules regarding live-animal handling.
- |
  

- Sometimes, perhaps more often than most people realize, you were just bad.
- |
  

- Regardless, your complaints have been heard and I'm eliminating the guesswork.
- |
  

- "This year, Santa will bring you  exactly what you want , from these three choices:"

- Rubber Ball
- "A powerful bouncer made from fine South American rubber that comes in one of four fruitrageous colors: biznana, strawberry sexjam, apricomicide, and sparkle."
- |
  

- But it's like two gifts in one, because each rubber ball, which I personally inspect, also comes with a complete list of games and instructions!

- Train Set
- A wonderfully detailed, H0-scale, three-car ride down Memory Lane, sure to provide hours of imaginative, old-fashioned fun.
