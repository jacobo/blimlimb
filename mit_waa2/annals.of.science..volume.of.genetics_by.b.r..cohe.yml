- JAMES WATSON, wisecracking 25-year-old American, recently arrived in England
- FRANCIS CRICK, British counterpart; not as ably cast as, say, Colin Firth; married; more sedate, but getting a giggly rush out of his new sidekick
- ROSALIND FRANKLIN, quiet, self-assured crystallographer with no patience for Honest Jim&#8217;s irritating flirty brilliance, nor any desire to go halfsies on the research.

- She is not involved in this case.
- The Immediate Background
- Rosy was a skilled X-ray diffracter, snapping the shots that likely clarified the double-helix structure of DNA while Jim and Francis were out tinkering ad nauseam with so many helices they were actually&#8212;God&#8217;s honest truth (actually, no)&#8212;nauseous.
- |
  

- They&#8217;d been trying to outwit the older, more famous, more likely discoverer, Linus Pauling, in a race to nail this thing down.
- |
  

- Jim and Francis sort of, how do we say, pilfered the pics from Rosy&#8217;s lab, kept it on the QT, and skated to everlasting fame.
- |
  

- She died of cancer shortly thereafter, and Watson and Crick took the Nobel, without her, in 1962.
- |
  

- By the bye, Jim&#8217;s tell-all,  The Double Helix , is a smidgen less than gracious toward the altogether reputable Dr. Franklin.
- And so we present, for wide release .
