- Monday, March 6
- Began new job today as junior salesman at commodity brokerage firm.
- |
  

- Took two hours for anyone to notice I had arrived at work.
- |
  

- Receptionist lady, Fran, made facetious comment as I went on restroom break.
- |
  

- "\"You're very quiet, Mr. Umezawa."
- "\" No shit, Sherlock."
- |
  

- I am a ninja.
- Tuesday, March 7
- Today at work no better than yesterday.
- |
  

- I am being pressured already to do things I do not wish to do to make sales.
- |
  

- "Other salespersons say to me constantly: \"Get out there,\" \"Mark my calendar,\" and \"Help me help you.\" I know not what such sayings mean, but they make me extremely uncomfortable."
- I wish they would refrain from such horrible directives.
- |
  

- I am tempted to mark furiously all of their calendars in shuriken rampage.
- |
  

- Alas, though, this is not the way of the ninja.
- Wednesday, March 8
- Discovered beautiful girl named Alicia works in mailroom.
- |
  

- Hung invisibly from ceiling and spied on her for 20 minutes before mustering courage to say hello.
- |
  

- For this, I am remorseless, of course.
- |
  

- Stalking is in my nature.
- "\"Hello,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- |
  

- "\"I am Shuruku, newest member of sales team, stealth warrior trained in the ancient art of ninjutsu."
- |
  

- You are?
- "\" \""
- Oh, you mean like in  Mortal Kombat ?
- "\" she replied."
- |
  

- "\"My boyfriend, Ken, plays that all the time on Xbox!"
- Damn Ken.
- |
  

- Damn that silly game.
- |
  

- Will I ever live this down?
- |
  

- Probably never.
- |
  

- People still ask me for codes to  Shinobi , and this confounds me greatly.
- |
  

- Is not Sega Genesis long since defunct?
- |
  

- This is ridiculous.
- Thursday, March 9
- Pushy woman from human resources demanded my presence at 11-o'clock meeting.
- |
  

- I arrived punctually, making loud coughing noises to ensure I was perceived.
- |
  

- "She told me: Sit."
- |
  

- "Pushy woman proceeded to question my job application\x97specifically, previous job title of \"surreptitious assassin/mail courier."
- "\" For whom did I work?"
- |
  

- And why did I not provide references?
- |
  

- "\"I work alone,\""
- |
  

- I replied.
- |
  

- This did not satisfy her.
- |
  

- Then, ninjalike, very cleverly and quickly, I clarified, "Freelance.
- "\" \""
- Fine," she said, rolling her eyes at me.
- Pushy woman from human resources will never know how closely death's shadow hovered over her.
- |
  

- I am baffled still that she would question the job history of one who lists "neck snapping" as foremost skill.
- Friday, March 10
- Made first sale today.
- |
  

- Vice president of sales took us out to celebrate for "liquid lunch" at "TGI Friday's.
- "\" I did not know what this meant\x97perhaps code?"
- |
  

- It sounded bad.
- Upon arrival at restaurant, whole sales team ordered round of drinks.
- |
  

- Waiter returned to table with tray full of beers, and, upon placing mine in front of me, stated, "The Asahi for you, sir.
- I was indignant at this presumptuous gesture.
- |
  

- Simply because I am Japanese I must prefer Asahi?
- |
  

- I said nothing, however, instead choosing to hide my anger at this cultural face slap.
- |
  

- Besides, they did not carry Sapporo on tap.
- |
  

- Asahi would do.
- Monday, March 13
- In the heat of battle, the art of stealth cannot be overemphasized.
- |
  

- Especially when photocopier runs out of toner.
- Tuesday, March 14
- All day long I am made to sit in a cube.
- |
  

- All I wish to do is leave this cube.
- |
  

- Yet, each time I leave for restroom break, I return to find turtle figurines strewn about my desk by anonymous office clowns.
- |
  

- Perhaps they think I do not understand this joke; they are wrong.
- |
  

- I, too, view animated television, though I am partial to Looney Tunes.
- I shall discover the offender by becoming invisible (or hiding under my desk).
- |
  

- Then, one evening, when he is working late, he will be visited by a ghost while walking to his automobile and so shall meet his demise.
- "Obsessed with cinematic apocrypha perpetuated by Steven Seagal and pizza-eating, animated \"ninja\" reptiles. These fools forget one very important, very real fact: poison-tipped blow darts."
- Wednesday, March 15
- Alicia has taken to sending mixed signals lately when alone in the kitchen with me.
- |
  

- Often will she bend slowly, gracefully over to obtain coffee filters from the cabinet below the sink.
- |
  

- This makes me confused, and very sweaty.
- Is Alicia becoming flirtatious with me?
- |
  

- Perhaps she has noticed me crouching behind the microwave?
- No, impossible.
- |
  

- I am a ninja.
- Thursday, March 16
- My acute sensory skills seem to indicate Alicia does not in fact wish to sleep with me.
- This is probably for the best.
- |
  

- Hot mailroom sex is not the way of the ninja.
- |
  

- Alas.
- Friday, March 17
- It is official.
- |
  

- "Thanks to Evan, the dumb, round intern, everyone has now verified what they had only at first suspected: I am indeed trained in the secret art of ninjutsu."
- |
  

- It is now only a matter of time until I am forced to end the life of a co-worker.
- "This is why I prefer to work alone\x97I mean, freelance."
