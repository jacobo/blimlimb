- So I couldn't get it to work, and neither could my father, who became more and more compensatory about the whole thing the longer we were out there, and finally I threw a huff fit and snapped the stick over my leg and left Dad standing there with it, which I realize now must have been the point at which he decided missing birthdays was the better choice, since from that point on he never came around again.

- I started trying to come up with my own ideas like Uncle Hale's, based on hours of research and study of numbers barfed out in error by our dot-matrix printer, the static on the TV, what have you.

- "Before Hale died he made real sure that he'd planted his seed inside me\x97sequestered me with the passion, if you know what I mean, and, really, I point to him as the reason I got interested in school and therefore why I'm sitting here enlightening you and the world's children on the mysteries of science."

- Takoma Park Middle School, Takoma Park, MD)
- I surely don't want you to believe it's always like this, but sometimes it's not the gas at all and just the desire of the person inside the car that makes it vroom.

- When my father took off, putting the pedal to the metal in his '72 Buick, he didn't have a cent, but somehow he found his way across the country in that car, so draw your own conclusions.

- Hale started hanging around the house more after that, until finally he moved in.

- Nights on the sofa first, then into Dad's side of the bed, eating his grits and slurping the coffee in the morning, calling Mom Jeanie (her middle name) like Dad had, and then even wearing his clothes.
