  JOAN OF ARC
  The tale of Joan of Arc is one of breathtaking faith: She heard the
  voice
  of God, and led an army for Him, refusing to renounce her views even
  unto
  burning at the stake. But perhaps it was not God's voice at all. Perhaps
  it
  was her mischievous younger brother, Hedric of Arc, hidden behind a
  tree,
  perpetrating a prank that got *way* out of hand.

  ANDY KAUFMAN
  Only now, 15 years after his death, is it becoming clear that Andy
  Kaufman
  was a comedic genius, turning his entire life into a work of art that
  may
  have infuriated some, may have irritated others, may have enraged a
  great
  number of . . .  wait a minute. Maybe he was just a jerk.

  ORSON WELLES
  At the end of his life, I'm sure Orson Welles had his regrets. Perhaps
  one
  of them was providing the voice for Unicron in "The Transformers: The
  Motion Picture." Perhaps not.

  JEFFREY WIGAND
  Few could dispute that it took great courage for Jeffrey Wigand to blow
  the
  whistle on the tobacco industry. But consider how much more courage it
  would have taken for him to do so while wearing a frilly dress. Which is
  the rumor going around.
