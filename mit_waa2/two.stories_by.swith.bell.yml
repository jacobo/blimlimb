- When I was four years old, my parents took me for a long walk in the country.
- |
  

- I was wearing Wellington boots that were too big and my socks fell down and bunched underneath the arches of my feet.
- |
  

- I had a pebble under my heel that I couldn't dislodge, so I was walking slowly.
- |
  

- My parents urged me to keep up.
- |
  

- They walked far ahead of me.
- |
  

- They were in love.
- |
  

- I started crying and wouldn't walk anymore until they came back to help me with the pebble.
- |
  

- They did come back to get me.
- |
  

- But instead of helping me with the pebble, my mother picked me up and dropped me into a field of bulls next to the road that was surrounded by a clicking electric fence.
- |
  

- My father told me the bulls would be my parents now.
- |
  

- One day I was crying in a field of bulls surrounded by a clicking electric fence and begging my parents to lift me over the fence and take me home.
- |
  

- The bulls were huge, snorting, ferocious and clearly about to charge.
- |
  

- My mother said she would lift me out if&#151;and only if&#151;I could catch a caterpillar and eat it.
- |
  

- I found one but it was so hairy and creepy that I dropped it and couldn't possibly find another.

- I was such a whiny crybaby.
- |
  

- Have you ever heard me cry?
- |
  

- You'd kill me.
- |
  

- So when I wouldn't stop crying, my mother picked me up and put me in a field of bulls next to the road that was surrounded by an electric fence.
- |
  

- My father said, "The bulls will look after you now!
- "\" But the bulls were really, really far away."
- |
  

- One day I was crying in a field of bulls surrounded by an electric fence and my mother asked me to eat a caterpillar just to see if I would do it.
- |
  

- My mother wanted me to stand up for myself.
- |
  

- I was such a wimp though.
- |
  

- I actually tried to eat a caterpillar but then just started crying again.
- Both my mother and father were pretty sure these two stories happened on different days.
