- His team's first baseman waited at home plate, both for his turn at bat and to congratulate the Bambino with a high five.

- |
  

- The stadium went quiet, but quick.
- |
  

- With two savagely efficient manipulations of his forearms, the Babe snapped the first baseman's spine in two places like a matchstick and dropped him to the ground like a rag doll.
- The Babe trotted back into the dugout as if nothing had happened, leaving the first baseman spasming and twitching in his wake as teammates and trainers ran out to assist.

- Not Sherm Daly, though.
- |
  

- The utility infielder simply spat some Copenhagen juice to the dugout floor and stared the genetic mishap straight in the eyes.
- |
  

- "He saw something in them: a little bit of humanity, a virgin palette untainted by the moving images that ruled our lives and helped pay his check, helped put the food in the babies' mouths."
- "\"Hey, Bambino, you just wanna play the field, don'tcha?"
- The slugger pursed his lips and motioned toward his mouth.
- |
  

- A cigar.
- |
  

- The big guy wants a cigar, Daly thought to himself.
- |
  

- I better get him one.
- |
  

- The live feed cut to a commercial while Daly desperately tried to track down El Duque in the clubhouse.
- |
  

- The dugout phone was ringing, ringing, ringing and it was probably the boss but nobody cared just then.

  CNN was the first to break the story: legendary slugger Babe Ruth had been reincarnated by a group of scientists.
