  The Yankee Doodle Boy
  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,
  But I also retain my cultural heritage from my parents' nation of choice,
  Because that's our right as Americans, even though they may not be current citizens.
  You're a Grand Old Flag
  You're a grand old flag,
  You're a high-flying flag,
  And forever in peace may you wave.
  You're the emblem of
  The land I love,
  So fuck Puerto Rico. Fifty stars is a nice round number,
  and it's hard 
  enough to memorize all the capitals as it is.
  God Bless America
  God bless America.
  We basically just kick ass.
  America the Beautiful
  O beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain.
  I probably won't vote when I'm finally 18.
  My older brother is a gay libertarian
  From sea to shining sea.
  The Star-Spangled Banner
  Take me out to the ball game,
  Take me out to the crowd.
  Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack.
  I don't care if I never get back.
  Let me root, root, root for the home team.
  If they don't win, it's a shame.
  For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,
  At the home of the brave!
  Yankee Doodle
  Yankee Doodle went to town
  A-riding on a pony.
  Mommy is at work tonight, so I made instant macaroni
  For dinner. Why don't they come to my baseball games anymore?
  My therapist tells me it's not my fault.
