  10. 1900 Galveston Hurricane
  In the movie Night Game, Roy Scheider plays a cop who discovers that
  every
  time a certain Astros rookie wins a game, some maniac in Galveston kills
  a
  prostitute with a hook. As it turns out, the fellow this pitcher
  replaced on
  the roster got liquored up down in the minors and fell asleep on the
  railroad tracks where a train ran over his wrist. Unable to reattach his
  
  hand, doctors replaced it, of course, with a hook. Although not for
  every
  taste, Night Game merges the baseball and serial killer genres better
  than
  any film since Pride of the Yankees.
  9. Tie: 1936 Johnstown PA Flood/1977 Johnstown PA Flood
  Trying to determine which of these floods was better is like trying to
  compare Johnny Bench to Ernie Lombardi. The old-timers have some
  incredible
  stories from '36, but many of these involve a gibbon who played poker
  and a
  "nine-foot Chinaman" named Sandbag Sam. On the other hand,
  immortalization
  in song ranks high on my list of criteria, and there's an old tune
  called
  "Night of the Johnstown Flood" which I assume describes the '36 event,
  but
  it might be about the Johnstown flood of 1889. Or 1863. Or 1862. In the
  end,
  I called it a draw, which will probably please no one.
  8. 1969 Cuyahoga River Fire
  Technically not a storm, but an incident in which sparks from a railroad
  car
  carrying molten steel over a bridge ignited the oil-soaked river, I
  entered
  this one as a write-in on the strength of the great Randy Newman song
  "Burn
  On." Also, having spent part of my youth in Pittsburgh where we had
  three
  rivers, hardly any of which ever burst into flames, I like bringing it
  up
  because it upsets Browns fans.
  7. 1991 Halloween "Perfect" Storm
  "October 1991. It was "the perfect storm" -- a tempest that may happen
  only
  once in a century... created by so rare a combination of factors that it
  
  could not possibly have been worse. Creating waves ten stories high and
  winds of 120 miles an hour, the storm whipped the sea to inconceivable
  levels few people on Earth have ever witnessed. Few, except the six-man
  crew
  of the Andrea Gail, a commercial fishing boat headed towards its hellish
  
  center." I copied that from the back of the Sebastian Junger paperback
  "The
  Perfect Storm," which the Kansas City Star calls "The perfect book for
  the
  beach."
  6.- 5. 1962 Ash Wednesday Nor'easter/1965 Palm Sunday Tornado Outbreak
  Some will say I chose these only because of their concurrence with
  religious
  holidays, and one could argue that any number of secular squalls -- such
  as
  the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane, and the 1979 Presidents' Day Storm -- are
  more
  deserving. Still, violent storms on holy days carry the extra glamour of
  
  Biblical wrath. Wouldn't it have been fun to watch an F5 tornado rip
  through
  South Carolina on Martin Luther King's birthday? Then, standing behind a
  
  makeshift podium crafted from an uprooted gas pump, Kweise Mfume could
  have
  pointed towards heaven and said "Now, about that flag..."
  4. 1962 Pacific Northwest Big Blow
  The wind was so strong on this day that planes were said to have "flown
  backwards." (Begin 80s-style stand-up routine) It seems to me that a
  plane
  being blown backwards by wind is not flying at all. It's CRASHING! (Big
  laugh). Besides, what kind of pilot would be stupid enough to fly into
  170
  mile-per-hour gusts? I once had a flight to Miami canceled because a
  butterfly in Thailand flapped its wings. (Smattering of polite, confused
  
  chuckles. Note: Use chaos theory bit for college crowds only).
  3. 1992 Hurricane Andrew
  In 1992, I was living in Houston and I remember following the
  devastation
  Andrew caused in south Florida, watching with fear, knowing that, after
  it
  picked up strength over the Gulf, our homes, our lives, could be next. I
  
  shared a house with three NASA engineers, and one of them posted a chart
  on
  the refrigerator door. Every hour, when the radio announced the latest
  position of the hurricane's eye, he would, with shaking hands, mark the
  latitude and longitude so we could trace its diabolic path. And every
  hour,
  we'd silently pray: "God, please destroy Louisiana." And He did.
  2. Tie: 1978 January Midwest "Superbomb"/1979 Jane Byrne Blizzard
  Superbomb makes the list because it has the coolest name of any storm in
  
  history. The following year, however, there was a storm of even greater
  consequence. Jane Byrne was running for mayor of Chicago against the
  powerful incumbent, Michael Bilandic, and she was all but flatlining in
  the
  polls. But on election day, the Midwest was hit with a terrible storm,
  and
  Byrne supporters, though fewer in number, were heartier,
  better-conditioned,
  and so tiny they could scamper across the snow like rabbits. They made
  it
  over the piling drifts and Byrne went on to become the most honest and
  least
  effective mayor Chicago ever had.
  1. 1975 Edmund Fitzgerald Storm
  Back in college, at the end of a long night, my buddy John and I used to
  
  stumble out of various bars singing: "At 7pm the old cook came on
  deck/He
  said 'Fellas it's too rough to feed ya'/At 11pm the main hatchway gave
  in/He
  said 'Fellas it's been good to know YAAAAAA.'" We thought we were funny.
  
  Still, "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" is a heck of a song, even
  though, as far as I can tell, "feed ya" does not rhyme with "know ya."
  Not at all. Certainly not the way,
  in the first verse,  "Kitchi-gummi" rhymes with "turned gloomy." Now
  there
  is a rhyme.
