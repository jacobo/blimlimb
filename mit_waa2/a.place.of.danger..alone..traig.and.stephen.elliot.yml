- By now you've probably heard how I spent my Christmas break.
- |
  

- I know, when you spoke of the importance of immersion, you were not actually advocating I go to Canada.
- |
  

- But I believe in what you said, and I believe in what I did, and, given the choice, I would do it again.
- |
  

- This is my story.
- Most of what I knew about Canada I'd read in the news.
- |
  

- I read it was unsafe and getting worse.
- |
  

- I read that the American occupation was a disaster and that we were turning our neighbors to the north into a breeding ground for anti-American sentiment.
- |
  

- I read about insurgents roaming the streets and reporters unable or unwilling to leave the safety of their hotels in the heavily secured area of downtown Toronto.
- |
  

- And the truth is that I wanted to see for myself how bad the situation was.
- Because I believe there are two sides to the story.
- |
  

- While perhaps we originally invaded Canada looking for illegal weapons that we never found, that doesn't mean there is something wrong with spreading democracy.
- |
  

- That doesn't mean that, deep down, Americans and Canadians don't want the same thing.
- |
  

- My parents grew up in Canada and remembered it fondly as a country of honest folk and simple pleasures.
- |
  

- They spoke warmly of Kraft Dinner and Mr. Big bars.
- I believed that Canada still existed, and that is what I was hoping to find.
- |
  

- Armed only with a Canadian phrase book, $1,000 U.S.
- |
  

- Roots  sweatshirt, and my ideals, I went to discover the Canada the American media has ignored.
- How did I get in?
- |
  

- It wasn't easy.
- |
  

- The borders were closed along Niagara and Washington state.
- |
  

- But it's a long border, full of holes.
- |
  

- There were times when I almost gave up.
- |
  

- After Seattle and Buffalo, I went to stay with this cousin who lives in Detroit.
- |
  

- He's kind of an ass.
- |
  

- My parents didn't know what I was trying to do, and he made me give him my PSP not to tell, but whatever.
- |
  

- I caught a taxi from Detroit over the border into Windsor.
- |
  

- "I'd really done it\x97I was actually in Canada, alone on enemy soil."
- And then things got harder.
- |
  

- I immediately realized I was in over my head.
- |
  

- Because of my Canadian heritage, I thought I would blend in, but that proved not to be true.
- |
  

- Sure, I looked Canadian, but as soon as I opened my mouth I gave myself away.
- |
  

- The staff at the Tim Hortons was shocked to hear my American accent.
- |
  

- They wanted to know what I was doing in Canada, who I was working for, my motives.
- |
  

- "They could see I wasn't a soldier\x97but what was I? For many of these people, I was the first American they had ever seen."
- Then there was the whole currency thing.
- |
  

- They have dollars, too, but they're different dollars, and trying to convert one to the other in your head before you buy something is a lot harder than you'd think.
- I would have turned around and gone home that first day if it weren't for the Canadians' overwhelming politeness.
- |
  

- Their famous hospitality was on display everywhere.
- |
  

- Bump into someone and they'll apologize to you, even if it was totally your fault.
- |
  

- But even Canadians have a breaking point, and it was on my third day there that I found it.
- Hey, did you know that the legal drinking age in Canada is only 18?
- |
  

- Well, it is!
- |
  

- And, if you ask me, that's Canada's biggest problem.
- |
  

- It was certainly mine.
- |
  

- I'm sure you've already read about the incident at the Toronto Dave & Buster's, and I don't want to get into it here.
- |
  

- Suffice it to say that I didn't know what a Mountie does, but it does not involve lap dances, as the name might suggest.
- |
  

- I probably should have asked first.
- "While American news is filled with stories about Canada\x97the new government, the constitution, the elections, and, of course, the death and destruction\x97news within Canada is much harder to get."
- |
  

- As a result, I had no idea of the furor caused by my actions and was surprised to see the blanket of press waiting on the tarmac for my arrival.
- |
  

- Also, I got grounded for, like, six weeks.
- That part sucks.
- |
  

- The rest of it, though, I don't regret a bit.
