  Sportings: Rangers of Texas 3, Red Sox of Boston&nbsp;2
  One of countless matches of the imperialist American game of bases-ball took place in the stifling heat of Arlington, in the very heart of territory stolen by Yankee colonial swine from Mexico in one of their many bloodlusting wars.
  Not surprisingly, Dominican traitor-dog and counterrevolutionary Alfonso Soriano &#8220;stole&#8221; the second of four possible white square pieces of leather, inappropriately called &#8220;bags&#8221; by lying American jackals. Theft occurs even in the children&#8217;s games of the capitalist scourge America. This theft is the occurrence which won the match for the puny Rangers of Texas, named after the illegal, bourgeois, reactionary police force of the stolen territory of Mexico, Texas.
  On the pile of dirt in the center of the four white square pieces&#8212;called a &#8220;mound&#8221; to insult the graves of heroic Marxist North Korean war dead&#8212;stood the pitcher for the assembled unit of Boston, Byung-Hyun Kim. Byung-Hyun Kim, from the illegitimate so-called Republic of South Korea, was sold into slavery by the lapdog prostitute government of South Korea to America. He now must stand upon the dirt hill at the center of the field and toss balls over one hundred times until exhausted and near death. The so-called Soriano &#8220;stole&#8221; the second &#8220;base&#8221; from him purposely to humiliate the Korean people. Both the imperialist Red Sox of Boston and the capitalist Rangers of Texas planned together for this insult to occur. The &#8220;defensive indifference&#8221; of the jackass Kevin Millar and the hyena Pokey Reese enrages all revolutionaries.

  Music: Lollapalooza Canceled
  The infamous American music festival at which the stupid young are idle and lazy has been canceled. The whore Perry Farrell lies without remorse that poor ticket sales are to blame. Upon hearing the news, the peerless leader Kim Jong-il released the following statement: &#8220;The Sonic&#8217;s Youth and the Modest Mice have been fooled by treachery.
