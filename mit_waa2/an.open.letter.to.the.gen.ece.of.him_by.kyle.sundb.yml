- Dude,
- I apologize for only now getting back to you.
- |
  

- When first asked if I did, in fact, want a piece of you, I could muster no reply.
- |
  

- Frankly, I was taken aback by your surprising offer.
- |
  

- Never have I witnessed such an act of selfless generosity.
- Alas, my soul does not possess the same depth of compassion for my fellow man as does yours.
- |
  

- While I do not always think of myself first, my welfare often holds a position among the front-runners.
- |
  

- I treasure my pieces too deeply.
- |
  

- I am, therefore, flattered and intrigued by your proposal.
- "Are you truly willing to give me\x97someone who only met you moments before, when you bumped into me and my drink on your way to the table shared by you and your acquaintances\x97a piece of yourself?"
- |
  

- The tone of your voice and your posture at the time indicated your sincerity regarding the issue, but please, you must be sure.
- |
  

- This is not something to be taken lightly and, I assure you, I regard it in all seriousness.
- Now, before I return to you my answer, I must ask if there is any piece in particular you wish to give.
- |
  

- Surely, when you asked if I wanted a piece of you, you had specific parts in mind.
- |
  

- I ask because I do not wish to take something that was not truly offered.
- |
  

- Neither do I really wish to receive a piece that I may already possess.
- |
  

- The portion that regulates your alcohol intake, for example, is similar to a part that already exists within me (though mine is certainly not nearly as worn from use).
- |
  

- You do have some pieces that I do not.
- |
  

- The multiple veins that pulsed and expanded throughout your neck are an example.
- |
  

- The embarrassed girlfriend would be another.
- Additional details that I would like to work out involve location.
- |
  

- When you suggested we take it outside, what was your intent?
- |
  

- Would this facilitate my receiving your piece?
- |
  

- I would appreciate some feedback on this issue, as well as on any other issues you feel have not been addressed.
- |
  

- Your recommendation that I get some, as you insisted, depends on your prompt reply.
- Thanks, bro,
- Kyle Sundby

  Dude,\n\
  I apologize for only now getting back to you. When first asked if I did, in fact, want a piece of you, I could muster no reply. Frankly, I was taken aback by your surprising offer. Never have I witnessed such an act of selfless generosity.\n\

  Are you truly willing to give me\x97someone who only met you moments before, when you bumped into me and my drink on your way to the table shared by you and your acquaintances\x97a piece of yourself? The tone of your voice and your posture at the time indicated your sincerity regarding the issue, but please, you must be sure. This is not something to be taken lightly and, I assure you, I regard it in all seriousness.\n\
