- If asked, she will say she is just a quiet sensitive girl who likes to curl up and read a nice romantic novel on her couch.
- |
  

- She may also say she has a catfish in her pants, so it's probably best if you don't talk to her.
- |
  

- Her collection,  The Middle Stories , gives the impression of a personal revelation that has been filtered through dream imagery as rigorously consistent as the metaphors of a tarot deck.

- If you don't read it, you'll feel left out at all the fall parties.

- The Middle Stories  delightfully refuses to fall into any preconceived notions of what narrative should do.
- |
  

- With precise, knife-edged prose, Heti has masterfully wrought a dark and compulsive collection, sprinkled with a touch of hand-wringing neurosis and dirty sex.
- |
  

- At once coy and ribald, delicate and vicious, this book is part fairy tale, part brain-twister, and all pleasure.
- |
  

- Heti has created the perfect bedtime book for thinking, literate adults.
