  A REVIEW OF BECK'S "MIDNITE VULTURES,"
  USING ONLY 
  THE LETTERS IN "BECK: MIDNITE VULTURES."
  It's... indiscreet.  It's like, "dick, dick, dick; smut, smut, smut; vice,
  vice, vice; slut, slut, slut."  Seductive Beck  is  Mister Luv.  Is Beck
  music's kinkiest librettist ever?  Beck, it seems, desires submissive
  bimbette mistresses under seventeen, dressed in slit miniskirts, derriere
  unveiled.  But I'd surmise nine men in ten lust like Beck lusts; it isn't
  eccentric.
  Is "Midnite Vultures" sick?  It'd incite tics in numbskull Bible Belt
  residents, sure, but it isn't sick, it's slick.  Slick like cr&egrave;me br&#251;l&eacute;e,
  dude, believe me.  "Midnite Vultures'" eclectic music revels in its ebullient
  leisure-suit-'n'-sideburns seventies vibe.  Never mind its tunes'
  intermittent mindlessness.  I like it.

  A REVIEW OF THE CURE'S "BLOODFLOWERS,"
  USING ONLY THE LETTERS IN "THE CURE:
  BLOODFLOWERS."
  Oh, Lord.  "Bloodflowers," where the out-of-touch Cure tell us, "Toodle-oo,
  fellow brotherhood of scowlers, we're bored."  Well, we're bored too.
  Cheerless, self-obsessed Robert S. broods for the whole dull CD.
  Heretofore, Cure records were sorrowful, sure, but so short of soul?  The
  wretched "Bloodflowers" follows Robert S.'s Rules of Order to the letter: Be
  blue, show oodles of woe, use two or three chords, flow too slow, blow out
  the subwoofers.
  The Cure's obsolete subculture'll doubtless feel the CD's cool, but the rest
  of the world should flee.  Flee!  Flee the terror of "Bloodflowers"!  The
  CD's worth lots of four-letter words, but we'll be less rude; so, to close:
