  The newspaper in my town of smallish size and stature reported today that
  a police officer was summoned to a home to save its inhabitants from a
  25-pound bat. The officer, it said in the newspaper, wrestled the bat to
  the ground. However, this was a lie. The bat was a normal-sized,
  teeny-tiny bat. No wrestling took place whatsoever. Police officers do
  this sort of thing all the time, and the newspaper will print it to
  alleviate everyone's boredom.
  Deer never die of natural causes. Deer get killed. It's a widely-known
  fact that deer are immortal creatures unless humans intervene. When I was
  young I was told that our friends "had a deer." This was thrilling. I was
  also told that the deer was "in the garage," and that was even more
  thrilling, because I imagined myself playing with their pet deer in the
  garage. I raced over to their garage and ran face first into a deer
  carcass, suspended from the ceiling on a hook or a rope or a chain.
  My friend Kathleen kept killing deer with her car. Everywhere she went,
  she killed a deer. If she went to the store to buy milk, a deer would die.
  Kathleen was upset. Kathleen has since moved far away.
  That reminds me of this one day when a moose fell off a highway overpass.
  This is the kind of place where, as everybody likes to say, everybody
  knows your name. They also know where you live, what car you drive, what
  you eat for breakfast, what brand of soap you use, and so forth, and so
  on. It's comforting to know that if I ever get hit in the head and develop
  amnesia, people will be able to help me out.
  Electricity is nice, but electricity is also overrated. Same with
  pavement.
  A fun thing to do is to sit in the middle of Main Street in the evening.
  Just sit there, right in the street. Nothing bad will happen to you. You
  can lie back and look at the stars and nothing will happen to you.
  When you want something around here, you usually can't get it. Unless you
  happen to want crawlers or farm implements or tasteful watercolors of
  wildflowers. Sometimes, though, those are precisely the things you want.
  The people in the woods just outside of town paint apocalyptic predictions
  on pieces of old wood and fasten these pieces of wood to the trees. The
  signs predict smiting and hellfire for various groups, the usual suspects:
  Catholics, Jews, foreigners, sinners, "all them that go against God."
  Once, inexplicably, it was Presbyterians.
  The headline in today's newspaper read, "Town Managers Meet, Decide to Buy
  Printer for Town Office." I do not know what will happen next.
