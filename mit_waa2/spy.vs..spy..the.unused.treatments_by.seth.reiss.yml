  Black Spy is vacationing at his favorite water park. He goes every year, and every year he tells himself he will build up enough courage to go down the 90-foot slide, but he never does. \"This year will be different,\" he says to himself. White Spy has planted a wiring device on Black's bathing suit and has heard every word. Quickly, but clandestinely, White breaks the neck of a water-park employee and steals his clothes. He comes out of the bathroom in perfect disguise. He tells the person working on the top of the 90-foot slide that his shift is over and it's time for lunch. The employee sees that it is 6 p.m., but, earlier in the story, he was told by the water-park supervisor never to question an order. Meanwhile, Black is waiting in line. He is very nervous and thinks it would be ironic if the slide killed him and not his friend/enemy White. White thinks the same thing, but because he has dyslexic thoughts\x97a problem he is too embarrassed to tell anyone about\x97he stops thinking altogether.
