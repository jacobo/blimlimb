  HANDY HINT
  Burlap wrapped around your dog's face when he's hanging his head out
  of a
     car window will keep bugs from sticking in his teeth. From time to
  time it
     may be necessary to remove the burlap and clean it. However, a neater
  dog
     will result and grooming will not be so tiring.

  DAD
  Dad was told by a fortuneteller that he would die September 9, 1993.
  The day
     came and went and Dad, who had died eight months previously, had the
  last
     laugh.

  FLOOR PIECE
  While you were asleep sweeping we took out the old floor
  and put in a better one.

  WHITMANIC POEM
  Even though your feet
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell like cheese,
  I prefer to think
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They smell
  Like good cheese.
