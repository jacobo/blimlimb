  One hundred people are invited to a party, and each is asked to RSVP. Each
  invitee is permitted to invite five friends, who are also asked to RSVP.
  (These friends are not allowed to invite friends of their own.)
  Of the eventual attendees, three-quarters will attend as couples; and of
  these, two-thirds will have RSVPed. The remaining quarter of the attendees
  will attend alone, and of these, one-half will have RSVPed.
  For every attendee there will be another attendee who has the same first
  name. If, for example, Mary Johnson attends the party, then at least one
  other Mary will be attending the party as well. Also, for every attendee
  with a surname that is also a common first name, someone with that first
  name will be at the party. So if John Patrick is at the party, then someone
  named Patrick&nbsp;-- Patrick Smith, say&nbsp;-- will be there too.
  Of the attendees, three-quarters will have graduated from prestigious
  four-year colleges or universities; the other one-quarter will have attended
  two-year community colleges. For the three-quarters the presence of the
  one-quarter will be, for want of a better word, delicious. (At an earlier
  such party, a Bennington alumna was intrigued to discover that the handsome
  young schoolteacher with whom she was chatting had recently graduated from
  Laramie County College (Wy.). She will be coming to the party again.)
  The world's three major presumed racial groupings&nbsp;-- Mongoloid, Negroid,
  Caucasoid&nbsp;-- will each be represented at the party. Attendees willing to make nametags
  for their grouping should indicate this when they RSVP.
  All of your ex-girlfriends will be at the party. (Many will wonder how this
  is possible. "I have dated 50 women," one reader e-mailed. "They are
  scattered throughout the Americas, as well as Europe and Asia. I believe two
  to be dead. Could it be that they will all be at the party?" The answer is:
  yes. They will all be at the party.)
  Employees of think-tanks will be disproportionately represented at the
  party, numbering one guest in twenty. These individuals are smart and
  well-read, and their research has been exhaustive, but remember that their
  conclusions are ideologically motivated.
  If one member of a "school" is at the party, then the school's other members
  will be there as well. If Max Horkheimer is at the karaoke machine, then
  Herbert Marcuse is likely rounding the corner with a mai tai. If an attendee
  should happen to spot Thomas Cole, the 19th-century landscape painter, then
  by necessity Asher B. Durand is somewhere in the apartment as well. Or he's
  on the way, or has already left. (Note: The members of each school will not
  necessarily arrive or leave together.)
  (Also: note that not every notable attendee is part of a school. When, for

  jump to the conclusion that Roy Blount, Jr. will be in attendance as well.
  The comic minds of the American South have influenced each other strongly,
  but they do not yet constitute a "school.")
  One-quarter of the attendees will encounter someone whom they know but did
  not expect to see at the party. "What are you doing at this party?" one will
  ask the other. "I might ask you the same question," the other will respond,
  and the two will share a laugh. But beneath the laugh there will be, for
  each, a deadly seriousness; each had come to the party hoping to start anew.
  For each attendee there will be another attendee on whom, over the course of
  the evening, their glance will tend to linger. One man may notice a woman
  who is the spitting image of his recently deceased aunt; another may marvel
  at the creamy skin of a toddler; another still might be moved with pity at
  the sight of a half-wit, or amputee.

  These guests will be asked to rev their engines every thirty seconds to

  I hope you all can make it.
