- Well, obviously no one  wants  genital herpes, but look at all those people in the Valtrex ads.

- They're really hot and seem to be having a blast.
- Just something to think about.
- |
  

- OK, yes, crabs suck, but think of the silver lining.
- |
  

- A good reason to get all new sheets!
- |
  

- And, seriously, who owns flannel  Star Wars  sheets past the age of 11?

- Frankly, this might just be the "It's time to grow up" wake-up call you've needed for a while. So, you're welcome.)

- "FYI\x97You might have been exposed to scabies."
- I'm not saying it's karma, but maybe next time you'll reach for the check.

- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Chlamydia.
- Sorry.
- |
  

- It is with great regret that I must inform you that you might have been exposed to syphilis.
- |
  

- It is with even greater regret, as it appears that this e-mail should have been sent a few months ago.
- But you know how it is.

- OMG!

- Herpes.
- |
  

- Just a tip.
- |
  

- You might have been exposed to crabs recently.
- Most probably from using a public restroom and not from that cute guy in marketing you went out with last week who is  very  hygienic.
- |
  

- And who's really into you.
- No, definitely not from him.
- |
  

- "To Whom It May Concern:"
- Gonorrhea is defined as a sexually transmitted disease caused by a type of bacteria called  Neisseria gonorrhoeae .
- |
  

- Gonorrhea can be transmitted to both male and female partners during vaginal, anal, and oral sex from a partner infected in his or her throat, vagina, urethra, or anus.
- |
  

- Gonorrheal infections are fully curable with antibiotics.
- See?
- |
  

- That's not so scary.
