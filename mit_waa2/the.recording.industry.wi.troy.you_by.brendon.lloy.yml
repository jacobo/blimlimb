  1. Downloading a song from the Internet.\n\

If your toddler has been named in this lawsuit, explain to them that the fruits of their labor as an adult will go to pay a debt that will ultimately lead to their death at a young age due to their inability to afford medical insurance. Toddlers never understand that, but they'll get the point if you make them cry. If your household pet has been named in this lawsuit, it will be euthanized.

  2. I am poor and cannot afford music. That is why I download songs at the public library. Please don't sue me or my children will starve. :(\n\

You will be billed $64.34 for the cost of the photos and processing.\n\
  If you decide to ignore this, that's the last mistake you'll make before you're on the street asking, \"Can you spare some change?
