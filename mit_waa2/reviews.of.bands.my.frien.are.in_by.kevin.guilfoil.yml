  PART II: THE OFFSHOOTZ
  In the early 90s, following the lead of groups like Wichita's Doe A
  Deer,
  and Jacksonville's Rhymes With P, Phil  Hatcher assembled a band that
  fused
  the punk and metal posturing of his angst-ridden and sexually-tormented
  adolescence with Broadway showtunes from the heyday of musical theater.
  The
  result, the Insane Fosse Posse, tried to reconnect a new generation with
  a
  rich chapter of America's cultural past. "I'd like to bring the music of
  
  Rodgers and Hammerstein to a younger, hipper audience," he'd say at the
  start of each show, just before turning a fire hose on three cockney
  flower
  girls dancing in a steel cage. Eventually, however, label interest in
  the
  Showcore genre began to wane and, in  July of '95 at Fireside Bowl, the
  Insane Fosse Posse played their famous encore medley, "Rock n' Roll All
  Night/Surrey With The Fringe On Top," for the final time.
  The following summer Phil let me stay with him in Lakeview while I
  looked
  for an apartment that would take cats. By that time, he was back in the
  clubs with a BoDeans tribute band called Milwaukee's Best. They played
  to
  enthusiastic college crowds all over Chicago's North side, and it
  appeared
  that Phil had finally discovered a lasting niche suited to his talents.
  Sadly, it wasn't to be. One night, the real Sammy "BoDean" Llanas
  confronted
  Phil right before Milwaukee's Best  opened their set at Empty Bottle --
  The
  BoDeans, it seemed, had wanted that particular gig for themselves. Phil
  tried to explain, insisting that Milwaukee's Best was a celebration of
  the
  BoDeans' art, and that they should be flattered by the effort. Sammy
  replied
  by calling Phil an idiot and yelling, loud enough for Phil's girlfriend
  to
  hear, that the BoDeans weren't even from Milwaukee -- they were from
  Waukesha.
  Too embarrassed to continue, Phil fled through the alley exit, and he
  broke
  up the band the next day. Sammy must have felt bad about it later,
  because
