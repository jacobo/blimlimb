  Monday
  Today I tried to thump a melon for freshness in the market. It
  shattered all over my pants. Same with grapefruit,
  tomato, bag of Fritos, and three pounds of pork tenderloins. Mind
  clearly elsewhere. Apologized to store manger only to hear, "It's you,
  isn't it? It's really you!" Shoppers began to crowd. Only then did I
  realize that, in haste to complete errands, I left the apartment without
  my fake eyeglasses. By evening news everyone knew that I shop at the
  Food Emporium on 82nd and Third. Momentarily considered reversing
  Earth's rotation to erase incident, but I've done that so often lately
  I'm not even sure what month it is anymore.
