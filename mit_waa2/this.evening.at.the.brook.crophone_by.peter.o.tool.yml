  Thanks. Thanks very much. I haven't had a reception like that since I published "Arms and Liberty" on the Heritage Foundation imprint. (Pause, wait for boos)
  This place is legendary. When it comes to bringing you laughs, I swear: I will brookings no quarter.
  But anyway, another great place, just up Massachusetts Avenue is the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (pause, wait for applause).  I gave a speech there about two weeks ago, on Russian nonproliferation programs.
  Anyway, I got lost on the way there, so I flagged down a taxi driver, and I asked him, "Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me how to get to the Carnegie Endowment?" And he looked at me knowingly, and said, "Research, research, research."
