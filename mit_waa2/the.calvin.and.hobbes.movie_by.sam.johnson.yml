- The story is based on this truck decal I saw where Calvin is peeing on a Ford logo.

- Since the story is grounded in real life, I got rid of Hobbes.

- Is he a toy or a talking tiger?
- |
  

- Tigers don't talk.
- |
  

- Doesn't make sense.
- |
  

- So he's gone, as is everything else about the comic strip.
- |
  

- It's too wordy and confusing.
- |
  

- In the movie, Calvin is this lovable-loser type who pees on corporate logos in his little hometown in central California (Centerville).
- |
  

- His girlfriend's dad makes her dump him because he pees on the dad's real-estate-company logo.
- |
  

- Calvin is so depressed he leaves town.
- |
  

- On the way out, he decides to pee on a Ford logo at a Ford dealership.
- |
  

- Big mistake.
- |
  

- He's busted.
- |
  

- But instead of going to jail, he's sent to the Ford headquarters, in Dearborn, Michigan.
- |
  

- Henry Ford VII tells him that Ford is a dying company.
- |
  

- It's in deep shit, being totally screwed by foreign competition.
- |
  

- Henry Ford VII needs Calvin's help for one last, desperate measure.
- |
  

- Under cover of darkness, Calvin is sent to a Mexican car company.
- |
  

- It's the biggest car company in the world, but most of the workers are practically slaves and nobody likes it there.
- |
  

- "But that's how it makes huge profits: shitty cars, slave labor, high prices."
- |
  

- That is, until Calvin pees on the Mexican car company's corporate logo (a Mexican in a sombrero and cape taking a siesta).
- |
  

- Some guys from Ford take a picture of Calvin peeing on the logo, and the picture gets put in papers everywhere.
- |
  

- But mostly it's printed in the U.S.
- |
  

- It's a huge embarrassment to the Mexican car company to have this gringo dude pee on their logo.
- |
  

- And Calvin becomes the most revered American of all time.
- |
  

- He pees on a bunch of other foreign corporate logos.
- |
  

- He's this huge deal, and it sort of goes to his head.
- |
  

- He becomes a big asshole who gets millions of dollars for making public appearances and peeing on logos.
- |
  

- Then, one time, he gets really drunk and completely misses a Nissan logo and pees on a little girl instead.
- |
  

- He's booed by all the people watching.
- |
  

- And the little girl cries.
- |
  

- He sort of laughs at her, then he sees his old girlfriend standing in the crowd.
- |
  

- "He feels ashamed because he's forgotten the real Calvin: a smalltime dreamer who pees on logos in Centerville, California."
- |
  

- Calvin gives up the highlife and goes home.
- |
  

- He gets rid of the entourage and the media and the trappings of success, and tries to live normally so he can win back his girl.
- |
  

- He helps his neighbors, he bags groceries, he walks dogs, etc.
- |
  

- He's just trying to get back to reality.
- |
  

- But it's then when he's most vulnerable, and the foreign corporations send their assassins, led by Professor Edward Tang, who has invented something called the "Atom Bullet.
- "\" It's sick!"
- |
  

- But with the help of his neighbors, and after a few narrow escapes, Calvin defeats him.
- |
  

- And, in the end, he gets his girlfriend back.
- |
  

- Although her dad is killed by this Mexican guy.
- |
  

- Other than that, though, it's a happy ending.
