- CENTRAL NEW YORK &#151; I received a phone call at the store last night from a woman determined to get a professional on the phone.
- "\"Now I have a question,\""
- |
  

- "\"but I would like to speak to an experienced person there."
- |
  

- A plumber or some experienced person.
- I told her I was not a plumber nor very experienced, but that I would try to help her with whatever question she had.
- She interrupted, "Oh, well, I would really like to speak to a plumber or someone older, not someone young like yourself.
- I said, "Well, I'm not sure if I'm young &#151; I'm 33.
- She said, "Oh, you're right, you're not young.
- |
  

- Well, I'm interested in getting some information about sewage vents.
- I asked, "Do you mean sewer vent caps?
- She said, "Yes.
- |
  

- The ones outside by the road.
- I said, "Okay, what's your question?
- She asked if we had any there, and I told her we did.
- |
  

- I said that we had two kinds &#151; one with an empty space beneath the mushroom-cap dome to allow for proper venting, and another that just covered the top of the sewer pipe.
- |
  

- I explained that a similar process secured both types of vents.
- She said, "Well, but I don't want it to come off.
- |
  

- What you're describing makes it seem like it'll come off.
- |
  

- You know, sometimes kids or snowplows knock them off.
- |
  

- Are these patented caps?
- I thought about her uneasiness about using the other two vent types due to kids or snowplows knocking them off.
- |
  

- This was a pretty remote possibility, as kids, at least as far as I can tell, don't arrange games around removing sewer vent caps for points, nor do snowplows often go over the curb a few feet to knock off the caps.
- |
  

- While I was thinking, she had asked another question, but now I wasn't sure what it was, so I asked her what she had asked.
- She repeated, "Are these caps patented, the ones you have?
- I said, "Well, I'm not sure, I could do a little &#151; "
- "\"Because,\""
- |
  

- "\"I was looking at my neighbor's cap, and I really liked what he has."
- |
  

- His kind of screws in to the top, and so there's nothing that can come loose.
- I said, "Are you sure you're talking about the sewer pipe vent cap, that sounds like the cap to the water shut-off?
- She said, "No, it's the sewer pipe.
- |
  

- I asked my neighbor about it.
- |
  

- I asked him, and he said it was patented.
- |
  

- And it came from Detroit.
- |
  

- Do yours come from Detroit?
- |
  

- And are they patented, because I want one that's patented?
- I said, "I really don't know where the caps come from, ma'am.
- |
  

- Neither the manufacturers nor their addresses are listed on the caps.
- |
  

- I'd have to look that up on the computer, and that may not tell me where they're actually from.
- |
  

- I would probably just get the name of the shipping company, and maybe their address.
- |
  

- I don't think I'd be able to trace them to Detroit or elsewhere, without doing quite a bit of research.
- "\"Oh, I see,\""
- |
  

- She was clearly disappointed.
- |
  

- "\"Well, he says it comes from Detroit, and it's patented."
- |
  

- And you don't know if what you have is patented, right?
- I said, "Yeah, I don't know.
- |
  

- These are the two caps we have, and these are the kind everyone buys.
- |
  

- We sell a lot of the mushroom-cap kind, especially.
- She said, "Okay, well, I'm going to do some calling around then.
- |
  

- Because I would like it to be patented.
- |
  

- My neighbor's is patented.
- |
  

- So, okay, well, thank you, and have a good night.
- I said, "Okay, good night.
- |
  

- I was standing in the plumbing aisle, shelving epoxy putty and tinning flux brushes, when a foursome appeared on my left.
- |
  

- Two males, two females.
- |
  

- I had briefly helped the males earlier.
- |
  

- Now they were back, and coming through the aisle slowly.
- |
  

- The men were looking for different copper fittings, while the women were doing the harder chore of pushing a heavy metal cart full of lumber.
- One of the men had long, brownish hair with blond streaks and wore a J&auml;germeister shirt.
- |
  

- He seemed to be in his early thirties.
- |
  

- "The other male was nondescript: slight paunch, mildly balding, average height, wearing jeans."
- |
  

- They asked me a couple of questions, while the women sort of giggled in the background.
- |
  

- I wasn't sure if they were giggling about some prior conversation, about me, or were just drunk and giggling about nothing in particular.
- |
  

- They all seemed like partiers, so I was leaning in the latter direction.
- As I resumed shelving, I began thinking of them having a soldering party while hooking up their hot and cold water lines.
- |
  

- I could envision them in the basement, laughing at cobwebs, dropping the torch a number of times, perhaps pawing each other near a dehumidifier.
- As I daydreamed, the J&auml;germeister guy told the women not to hit me with the cart.
- The women were proceeding up the aisle past me.
- |
  

- One of the women said, "We're fine.
- |
  

- He's all right.
- |
  

- We have plenty of room.
- "\" She was still giggling."
- Then she said, "It would probably make his day if two women ran him over with a cart.
- "\" She turned her head halfway to me, but couldn't quite see me as she had passed already."
- |
  

- She left it at that, and both women giggled all the way up the aisle toward the cashiers.
- As I continued stocking, I was left to contemplate her final remark &#151; about how being run over by two women would make my day.
- All I was able to think of was, "How?
