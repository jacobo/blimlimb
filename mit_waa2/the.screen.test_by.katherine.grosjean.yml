- Listen closely, my darling.
- |
  

- Block out all sound from the street below and hear nothing but the sound of my voice, my breath, my heartbeat.
- |
  

- You feel yourself getting sleepy, so sleepy.
- |
  

- Your body, your limbs, your mind are heavy and free of tension.
- |
  

- Even your eyes you find hard to keep open.
- |
  

- They close, but you hear everything I say.
- |
  

- Can you hear me, sweetness?
- Yes, Count.
- Good.
- |
  

- Now, you will enjoy this feeling of relaxation and delicious heaviness that I gift you with today.
- |
  

- You will enjoy it, and you will be grateful for it, so grateful that you want to make the Count happy in return, yes?
- Yes.
- |
  

- Oh, yes.
- Good.
- |
  

- Do you know, my little dove, what would make the Count happy?
- I should let you bite my neck?
- No. I mean, yes.
- |
  

- But there are some things we must take care of first, my little dove.
- |
  

- We have barely met, after all.
- |
  

- I must know the real you before I partake of your nectar.
- |
  

- I want to know your secrets, your memories, your shames.
- |
  

- Will you help me to know you better?
- Um.
- |
  

- OK.
- Good.
- |
  

- Now tell me about your lover.
- |
  

- I want to know his name and what he does.
- Which one?
- Oh.
- |
  

- You have more than one lover?
- |
  

- Well, this is a surprise.
- |
  

- Even though the Count had to give up the virgin thing in the '70s, he is still discriminating above all else.
- |
  

- When you are the best, you can choose to be picky.
- Mmmmmm.
- "Ah, but I am mesmerized by you,  mon ch\xE9re ."
- |
  

- You smell delicious, so ripe.
- |
  

- Is that musk?
- |
  

- I can allow you an indiscretion or two, but first I need details.
- |
  

- Tell me about your lovers then, all of them.
- Well, there's Chuck.
- |
  

- He's an electrician.
- |
  

- I see him once a week for dinner and a movie.
- |
  

- He's nice.
- Does Chuck make love to you?
- I guess you could call it that.
- You guess .
- |
  

- Enter me?
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- I think so.
- |
  

- He's pretty small.
- Does he use a condom?
- I don't know.
- |
  

- It's usually dark.
- |
  

- But yeah.
- |
  

- I'd say he's the condom type.
- |
  

- He's pretty insecure about his you-know-what.
- |
  

- He'd probably like to bolster up its size.
- |
  

- Or hide it.
- Good.
- |
  

- Good.
- |
  

- You are being a very good girl.
- |
  

- We shall be together soon, I promise.
- |
  

- Now tell me about the others.
- |
  

- Tell me all.
- Well, Gordie is the guy who lives across the hall.
- |
  

- He's a webmaster and keeps really weird hours.
- |
  

- I never know when he'll show up.
- |
  

- Could be every day, could be once a month.
- And .
- |
  

- He enters me.
- |
  

- But not always in the same place.
- And .
- |
  

- And I know he wears a condom, because he likes those glow-in-the-dark ones.
- |
  

- He even gets up halfway through and stands in front of the open fridge door to recharge it.
- Excellent.
- |
  

- More.
- |
  

- Tell me more.
- Then there's Francis, our pastor.
- |
  

- He likes to be spanked.
- |
  

- Hard.
- |
  

- We had sex, just once.
- |
  

- But he wasn't wearing a condom.
- |
  

- He said the Lord would be our love glove.
- Hmmm.
- |
  

- No condom.
- |
  

- How long ago was that encounter,  mon petit chou ?
- Oh, a couple of years ago.
- And have you ever been tested for HIV?
- |
  

- Hepatitis?
- |
  

- Herpes?
- Um, not that I know of.
- Not that you know of?
- |
  

- Do you have any idea how prevalent cases of sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, hepatitis, and herpes are right now?
- |
  

- Especially in L.A.
- |
  

- And you, with your multiple partners!
- |
  

- Honestly.
- |
  

- Silence.
- |
  

- Forgive me, love of my life.
- |
  

- I got a little hot under the 5-foot standup collar there.
- |
  

- It's just that in my line of work, one can't be too careful about quality control.
- |
  

- I mean, when I say I want to "suck you," I mean it quite literally, as in "dry.
- "\" I really don't want to test the limits of that immortality thing."
- |
  

- Or worse, can you imagine being riddled with lesions, genital sores, or bleeding cankers and never being able to recover or die?
- |
  

- Can you imagine living through eternity with chronic fatigue?
- |
  

- Silence again.
- |
  

- He leans in close and lingers.
- |
  

- Mmmm, but you smell divine, my love.
- |
  

- So earthy, so primal.
- |
  

- Alas, my desire consumes me and overrides all sense of reason!
- |
  

- I must have you.
- |
  

- Here.
- |
  

- And now.
- |
  

- But .
- |
  

- Yes?
- |
  

- Yes?
- |
  

- First, I want to extract a promise from you, dear heart.
- |
  

- I have some literature from an excellent clinic just down the street from here.
- |
  

- Wonderful place, very anonymous.
- |
  

- I send all my potential lovers there, at least the ones I am willing to wait for.
- |
  

- Promise me that you will read and absorb them.
- |
  

- Learn about healthy active living.
- |
  

- Get tested.
- |
  

- Use condoms.
- |
  

- Be sensible, for goodness' sake.
- |
  

- I want this to be a lasting relationship, but we must be able to trust one another, yes?
- |
  

- Groan.
- |
  

- Don't fret, sweetheart.
- |
  

- I have contacts at the laboratory.
- |
  

- I'll call you when your test results are in.
- |
  

- Probably.
