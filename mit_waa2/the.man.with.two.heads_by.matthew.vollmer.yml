- "Q: So, why the two heads?"
- "Man with Two Heads: I dunno."
- |
  

- In a way, it's almost like, everything else has been done before.
- "Q: So, a kind of \"look what I can do\"?"
- "Two Heads: Not so much look at what I can do as look at what you could be."
- |
  

- I'm thinking about a two-headed men renaissance.
- "Q: So there was a time before, when all men had two heads?"
- "Two Heads: There was a time when it had been an accepted way of existing, yes, and we do have actual film and photographs and folk songs of these two-headed persons which attest to their existence, though these things kind of support the idea that the existence of two-headed persons is somewhat cardboard, as if the two-headed men had only been born to be some kind of warped carnie."
- "Q: So you're saying, \"Look at me."
- |
  

- I have two heads.
- |
  

- Take me seriously.
- "Two Heads: In a way."
- |
  

- But while I'm saying take me seriously, I'm also saying, go ahead, poke fun at me.
- "Q: Is it also a kind of style thing?"
- "Two Heads: Yes and no."
- |
  

- I'm not about style.
- |
  

- Because when you think about it, the body really isn't outfitted for two heads.
- |
  

- In fact, the second head can be somewhat cumbersome.
- "Q: Were you born with two heads?"
- "Two Heads: I'm going to interpret that comment as \"Were you born with two physical heads?"
- "\" No, I wasn't."
- |
  

- I was however born with many possible heads.
- |
  

- Through conditioning and environment and athletics and reading and car accidents, I now have the head with which I'm speaking, which most people would interpret as one head.
- |
  

- I see it as an infinite number of heads.
- "Q: Let's talk about the second head."
- |
  

- Who is it and where did it come from?
- "Two Heads: The head originated from Tobias Wetherhill, a Seventh-day Adventist minister from Silver Springs, Maryland."
- "Q: Did you wake up with the head?"
- |
  

- Or did you seek it out?
- "Two Heads: The head pretty much sought me ought."
- |
  

- I'd been thinking about getting another head for a while, and one of my friends said he knew somebody who knew somebody.
- |
  

- That somebody was trying to get rid of a head.
- |
  

- The rest is history.
- |
  

- It's not exactly legal, what happened, so I can't exactly go into it without incriminating ourselves.
- "Q: Does it always sleep?"
- "Two Heads: For now, yes."
- |
  

- It will take some time for the head to adjust to its new body, and likewise.
- |
  

- There's been a lot of sleep-talking, which is good because it allows me to get to know my new head in a totally risk-free environment.
- "Q: What do you call the second head?"
- "Two Heads: We refer to ourselves as \"us\" or \"I,\" depending on how we feel."
- |
  

- Mostly we speak at the same time, but we rarely say the same things, partly because when the second head is speaking it's also unconscious.
- |
  

- At first you'll realize it's kind of hard to understand us, but then you realize, these heads are coming from the same place.
- |
  

- They're saying the same things, but differently.
- |
  

- All in all, it's a testament to the multiplicity of human existence.
- |
  

- In fact, I'm working on a theory that attempts to argue that a two-headed person is actually more "authentic" than a one headed person.
- "Q: Do people with split personalities count?"
- "Two Heads: In a way."
- |
  

- They count more because they usually have to deal with more than one person, which is true of us all, we just repress the urges to be twelve different people.
- |
  

- There are anywhere from between sixteen hundred and twelve thousand different competing and potential personalities within a human being.
- |
  

- That's a headful of voices!
- |
  

- However, the one-headed split personality person really can't make the grade when it comes to having two heads.
- "Q: And why is that something you see as important?"
- "Two Heads: Having two heads makes one ultimately conscious of the other."
- |
  

- We are so used to the one-headed system that it's possible to forget that anything else exists.
- |
  

- With a two-headed system, we can experience the true burdens of being human, and we'll start learning how to share and live outside ourselves more.
- "Q: Your second head appears to be leaking."
- "Two Heads: He drools, yes."
- "Q: Is the drool usually that color?"
- "Two Heads: Um, yes."
- |
  

- One can expect a certain amount of discharge.
- |
  

- We should probably be going now.
