title: Forsaken, the Crew Awaited News from the People Below

  BY  J.M. MARTINEZ

  Forsaken, the crew awaited news from the people
  below.  At noon they gathered at the helm.  The device
  was on.  They leaned into it, their ears pressed
  against the auricular, and heard nothing.  Stomachs
  rumbled&#151;Robert mistook the rumbling for the burning
  of coal, but he was quickly shushed and corrected.
  By midnight only five remained.  The rest had
  gone below.  The five at the helm waited for news, but
  heard nothing, not even rumbling stomachs.  (Lunch had
  been served at two: braised goose, Pop Tarts,
  fettuccini.)  Robert expressed anger, and also (at
  eight) renewed hunger. He was shushed and reprimanded.
   They waited, ears close to the auricular on the
  device, and developed theories.
  The theories:
  (1) The device was working, else at least one person
  from the crew would have returned and asked if they
  had not heard him, the person returning, speaking
  through the device&#151;maybe shouting.  Maybe even
  gesticulating, as many do when on the telephone, for
  no practical reason.  But something was keeping them&#151;what it was, nobody knew.  But:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was so interesting that it kept the crew
  below thoroughly absorbed.  All interest in
  communicating with those above was replaced by
  interest in this considerably more interesting thing.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It was so deadly that it obliterated the crew
  before they could use the device.  And not only deadly
  and terrible, but also very very quick, for how else
  could it get to them before they could even scream?
  (2) The device was not working, else they would have
  heard some sign of it at work.  Regardless, as in (1),
  some force kept them below.  So:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As in (1a), though some conceded that maybe
  even with the interesting thing, the crew would have
  made some efforts to use the device&#151;perhaps to tell
  them of the interesting thing.  But if it was  too 
  fascinating, they agreed, the efforts to communicate
  via the broken device or to attempt repair were most
  likely half-assed.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As in (1b):  They had not returned because
  they had been eaten&#151;or  something &#151;by the
  horrible thing.  And they had not heard the screams
  (and other remonstrations of agony & etc.) because of
  the malfunctioning device.  Unlike (1b), (2b) posited
  a thing that needed not be devilishly quick.  As a
  variant of which:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The thing itself had disabled the device, and
  proceeded to (2b).  So the thing did not need to be
  possessed of uncanny swiftness, merely some basic
  mechanical ability.  Or luck: it might have broken the
  device by accident.
  (3) The crew below were playing a practical joke on
  those above.  Ha ha.  Though of course it was probably
  terrifically funny once down there&#151;you were "in the
  know" the minute you descended.  Were there not
  muffled chuckles heard through the device?  Alas,
  there were not.  But the device could have been
  temporarily disconnected.  Ha ha.  And the forsaken
  crew above&#151;only three remained&#151;would be forced
  to consider theoreticals (1a) - (3a), much to the
  delectation and hooting of those below.  Also maybe:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It had started as a joke, but the presence of
  a horrible thing could have led to theoreticals
  (2a)-(c).
  Forsaken, the three awaited news.  Robert
  complained, and panicked, and said he was going down
  there.  To which the other two said, Whatever, fine,
  do what you will.  But he was just bluffing, the
  coward.
  They reached shore and contacted the maritime
  authorities.  The authorities boarded the ship.  They
  were never seen again.  More authorities boarded, also
  never to be seen again.
  Nobody has since gone into the bowels of the
  ship.
  All passageways leading downwards have been
  sealed.
  Its helm (with the device intact, functioning or
  not) is open to the public on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
  from nine to five, two dollars for adults, one dollar for children, free for
  children under two.  Photographs are allowed but not
  encouraged.
  Most, when photographed, lean into the device,
  ears against the auricular.  "Hello?" they say in
  jest. If the crew and authorities are still down
  there, and the device is functioning from their end,
  that's all they hear:  Hello, hello, hello.  Hello,
  anybody there? Hello?
