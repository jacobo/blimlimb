- SIGMUND FREUD
- Perhaps, contrary to a century's worth of psychoanalytic tradition, Freud never meant to suggest that all men want to sleep with their mothers.

- BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
- If, through some freak electrical mishap, Bruce Springsteen's clothing were to be ignited while he was onstage at a concert, how many times would he have to shriek "I'm on fire!

- TOM JONES
- There must be nights, when Tom Jones is singing "What's New, Pussycat" for the 5,000th time, and the women are shrieking like they do every night and a hail of panties is landing on the stage like thousands of times before, when he just thinks, "Man, I'm getting sick of this.

- VINCENT VAN GOGH
- I find it remarkable that in all the accounts of Vincent Van Gogh's cutting off of his ear and sending it to his brother nobody has yet suggested that it might have been the result of a domestic accident.

- Salinger's work comes from the knowledge that he has chosen to withdraw from the public eye for the past five decades?

- The books would be no less beautiful &#151; not a word would change &#151; but if, for instance, Salinger had spent the past few years drawing a paycheck as a staff writer for Vanity Fair, mightn't that dim the appeal of Franny and Zooey just a bit?
