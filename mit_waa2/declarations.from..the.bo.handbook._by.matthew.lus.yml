- Be prepared for life&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;to live happy and die happy.
- Become an antilitter fiend.
- It is also an opportunity for good fellowship.
- That's the big idea.
- What a glorious feeling to jump into the lake and strike out for the diving raft with your buddy.
- Not a care in the world.
- And then, of course, another swim.
- And maybe not just a swim.
- It may be a vigorous game of capture the flag.
- Darkness is falling.
- You take a deep breath.
- You bend down.
- Repeat.
- If you want to have an agile, supple body covered with flat, firm muscles, you must bend it, twist it.
- Don't kick.
- Just glide.
- Stop for a rest every half hour or so.
- But don't stop here.
- A deer breaks through the underbrush.
- Then the leaves fall.
- A cottontail runs off.
- Suddenly a pheasant takes flight.
- It takes off as it catches your scent.
- Now lots of songs.
- A lake may seem peaceful and quiet.
- Not so.
- You'll be wrong.
- Now get down flat on your belly and check on what's there.
- Use a magnifying glass if you have one.
- Groundhog hairs.
- Feather.
- Cracked nut.
- It is a botanical puzzle.
- Gnawed cone.
- Shed snakeskin.
- Barn swallow.
- Squirrel.
- This is soon followed by the detested Norway rat.
- Brother, that's a trick that takes patience and skill.
- Some minutes go by.
- Crickets chirp.
- A head peers up cautiously.
- Katydids sing.
- Then the whole, chunky body comes out.
- Get help from experts.
- From the lake comes a steady banjo tune.
- The air around us seems limitless.
- It isn't.
- You will be found.
- But don't stop here.
