  This is the issue with the soundtrack. This soundtrack was composed by They
  Might Be Giants, landmark musicmakers of our time. There are also songs by
  Philip Glass, Doughty (of Soul Coughing), Roger Greenawalt and others. This
  soundtrack, it is something. Forty-five songs, ranging in length from 8
  seconds to 3 or so minutes. It is something, this. It is weird and
  experimental and full of good. There are very strange audio fragments, and
  there are hits. Huge, huge hits. Huge.
  In most cases, the band took the issue's pieces&nbsp;&#151; fiction, essays, art, etc.&nbsp;&#151; 
  and then composed music commensurate in duration and tone. In a few cases
  it worked the other way around.
  This book is a cloth-covered hardcover book. When you see it in stores it
  will be wrapped in plastic. Here are other things inside:
  Ian Frazier has written a brilliant and moving eulogy for Saul Steinberg.
  This piece is accompanied by a few very rare pieces by Steinberg.
  Ann Cummins has written a great story called "Billy by the Bay." On the CD,
  she reads this story (a truncated version thereof) with musical
  accompaniment.
  Similarly, Arthur Bradford reads a piece called "Roslyn's Dog." It is about
  a dog.
  Zadie Smith has written a great story called "The Girl with Bangs." Unlike
  most of the pieces in the issue, this one was written after the song had
  been composed. Ms. Smith responded, if you will, to the song called "Bangs,"
  one of the disc's many bonafide hits.
  Doughty composed a new song for a series of sketches by comics masterman
  Chris Ware. The piece by Ware is a sketch meant for children but was
  rejected for its inappropriateness for children. You will see why. Doughty's
  song is truly amazing. In involves a frog and a banjo.
