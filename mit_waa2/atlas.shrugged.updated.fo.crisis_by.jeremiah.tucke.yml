- "\"Damn it, Dagny!"
- |
  

- I need the government to get out of the way and let me do my job!
- She sat across the desk from him.
- |
  

- She appeared casual but confident, a slim body with rounded shoulders like an exquisitely engineered truss.
- |
  

- How he hated his debased need for her, he who loathed self-sacrifice but would give up everything he valued to get in her pants .
- |
  

- Did she know?
- "\"I heard the thugs in Washington were trying to take your Rearden metal at the point of a gun,\""
- |
  

- "\"Don't let them, Hank."
- |
  

- With your advanced alloy and my high-tech railroad, we'll revitalize our country's failing infrastructure and make big, virtuous profits.
- "\"Oh, no, I got out of that suckers' game."
- |
  

- I now run my own hedge-fund firm, Rearden Capital Management.
- "\"What?"
- He stood and adjusted his suit jacket so that his body didn't betray his shameful weakness.
- |
  

- He walked toward her and sat informally on the edge of her desk.
- |
  

- "\"Why make a product when you can make dollars?"
- |
  

- Right this second, I'm earning millions in interest off money I don't even have.
- He gestured to his floor-to-ceiling windows, a symbol of his productive ability and goodness.
- "\"There's a whole world out there of byzantine financial products just waiting to be invented, Dagny."
- |
  

- Let the leeches run my factories into the ground!
- |
  

- I hope they do!
- |
  

- I've taken out more insurance on a single Rearden Steel bond than the entire company is even worth!
- |
  

- When my old company finally tanks, I'll make a cool $877 million.
- Their eyes locked with an intensity she was only beginning to understand.
- |
  

- Yes, Hank .
- |
  

- If we're to win the battle against the leeches, we must get it on .
- |
  

- Don't let them torture us for our happiness .
- |
  

- He tore his eyes away.
- "\"I can't."
- |
  

- Sex is base and vile!
- "\"No, it's an expression of our highest values and our admiration for each other's minds."
- "\"Your mind gives me the biggest boner, Dagny Taggart."
- "He fell upon her like a savage, wielding his mouth like a machete, and in the pleasure she took from him her body became an extension of her quarterly earnings report\x97proof of her worthiness as a lover."
- |
  

- His hard-on was sanction enough.
- "\"Scream your secret passions, Hank Rearden!"
- "\"Derivatives!"
- "\"Yes!"
- "\"Credit-default swaps!"
- "\"Oh, yes!"
- |
  

- Yes!
- "\"Collateralized debt obligation."
- "\" YES !"
- |
  

- YES !
- |
  

- YES !
- |
  

- Dagny and Hank searched through the ruins of the 21st Century Investment Bank.
- |
  

- As they stepped through the crumbling cubicles, a trampled legal pad with a complex column of computations captured Dagny's attention.
- |
  

- She fell to her hands and knees and raced through the pages and pages of complex math written in a steady hand.
- |
  

- Her fingers bled from the paper cuts, and she did not care.
- "\"What is it, Dagny?"
- "\"Read this."
- "\"Good God!"
- "\"Yes, it's an experimental formula for a financial strategy that could convert static securities into kinetic profits that would increase at an almost exponential rate."
- Hank studied the numbers.
- |
  

- "\"The amount of debt you would need to make this work would be at least 30-to-1, but a daring, rational man who lives by his mind would be willing to take that risk!"
- "\"Yes, and it's so complex the government could never regulate it."
- "\"It's perfect."
- |
  

- "There's only one problem\x97half the pages are missing."
- |
  

- Could you reconstruct it, Dagny?
- "Her answer escaped her lips like air from a punctured galvanized-steel duct:"
- "\"No.\""
- "\"I didn't think so, but why leave such an achievement to rot here?"
- |
  

- It's the greatest thing I've ever laid eyes on, made by a monumental genius, the sort of mind that's only born once in a century .
- |
  

- Dagny, why are you fondling your breasts?
- |
  

- There was still the breathless tone in her voice when she asked, "The financial strategy .
- |
  

- I found .
- |
  

- "\"Yes,\""
- |
  

- John Galt's face betrayed no signs of pain or fear or guilt, and his body had the clean tensile strength of a foundry casting with skin the color of a polished full-port brass valve.
- |
  

- In the center of this secret mountain valley where the titans of Wall Street had retreated for an extended junket was a 3-foot-tall dollar sign of pure gold atop a granite column.
- |
  

- It was tacky, yes, but it was also their emblem, a symbol of their triumph.
- "\"But why did you leave it behind?"
- "\"Because once I committed the plan to memory I no longer needed it."
- "\"I don't understand."
- "\"The capital-gains tax, Dagny,\""
- |
  

- Galt said.
- |
  

- "\"We loathe it."
- "He pointed to the houses of men she knew, and the names sounded like the richest stock market in the world\x97a roll call of honor."
- "\"Our money represents our spirit's values,\""
- |
  

- Galt said.
- |
  

- "\"When the government takes our profits, it is literally robbing us of our souls."
- |
  

- I will not apologize for my wealth to a nation of looters.
- |
  

- We who live by the mind could've been engineers, scientists, doctors, extreme-sports enthusiasts, but there is no purer pursuit than the pursuit of money.
- |
  

- A  is  A .
- |
  

- Money begets more money, and .
- |
  

- Galt went on like this for what seemed to Dagny like hours, until, finally, something he said piqued her interest.
- "\"And that's why I created the financial plan you found."
- |
  

- It's true, it works.
- |
  

- But it is not sustainable.
- |
  

- It will ruin this country's financial system, and then we'll see how those who despise us prosper when their lenders and investors refuse to invest or lend.
- "\" He laughed joylessly."
- |
  

- "\"Funny, isn't it?"
- |
  

- I must destroy the very thing I love in order to save it.
- "\"Just to avoid paying taxes?"
- "\"I do not compromise my beliefs, and I will kill anyone who asks me to!"
- A silence fell between them, and it was awkward.
- Finally, Dagny asked, "So, just out of curiosity, how much are you worth?
- He shrugged.
- |
  

- "\"What is infinity?"
- She let out a rich, powerful moan, like the sound of a passing diesel train in the night.
