- "\"Teamwork is what this is all about."

- Having a buddy makes it, like, infinity times better.
- "\"If you get hit, then you'll die."

- Most things you hit die on contact, too, though, except for big bosses.
- "\"You can swim in ordinary water in the jungle, but nowhere else."

- You cannot jump out of the water, but you can drag yourself out of the side.
- |
  

- Swimming elsewhere will kill you.
- "\"If you are prone (on your belly) and you jump, you will instead drop down to the next floor."
- |
  

- There are some floors that don't let you do this.
- |
  

- Also, do not drop if there is anything deadly directly above you.
- |
  

- Dropping makes you briefly stand up, and you will die.
- "\"Your Laser (L) produces a column of what appears to be flame."
- |
  

- This weapon is the worst for enemy bases where the soldiers are really tiny.
- "\"I should probably mention the energy zone."
- |
  

- We don't really know what's going on there, but it leaks like a bitch.
- "\"In the hangar, watch out for spiky walls that pop up in front of you."
- |
  

- Step onto new platforms with hesitancy.
- |
  

- When under the mechanical arms, DON'T FREAK OUT!
- |
  

- Just take tiny steps one at a time and you'll get to the alien's lair no problem.
- "\"As you shoot the final giant alien heart, it will beat faster, just like when you shoot giant human hearts."
- "\"When you have finished this mission, you can consider yourself a hero."
- "\"Up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a-start."

- Live it, love it, learn it.
