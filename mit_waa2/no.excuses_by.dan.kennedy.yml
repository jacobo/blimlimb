- I can't right now, because I have to look up ex-girlfriends and people I knew back in high school on the Internet and find out that one guy I knew has a band now and the band played at a tavern called Nita's Hideaway in Tempe, Arizona in May of 1997.
- I'm going to be late, because I'm doing a thing where I try to get the tip of a dried-out marking pen to fit through a paper clip and then balance on the edge of the top drawer of my desk.
- Not tonight, because I'm in the living room trying to get up from sitting on the couch in a cross-legged position, only I have to do it without using my hands, and then I have to go all the way to the kitchen without touching the floor.

- So, basically I'll be walking across the couch then onto the chair, then across that small table, and then jumping from the table into the kitchen.
- I would, but I'm doing the thing where I stand in front of the fridge eating ravioli from the plastic container, too lazy to boil and heat them, and then I have to go sit in the living room feeling bored and sick.
