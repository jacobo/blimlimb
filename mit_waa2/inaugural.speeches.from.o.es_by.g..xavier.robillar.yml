- He-Man   Although I realize that I was not elected by a majority, I pledge to represent the interests of all.
- |
  

- I have also retained many of my father's advisers to guide my way.
- I will cut taxes, balance the budget, and rid the world of Skeletor.
- |
  

- Skeletor is evil.
- |
  

- Skeletor does not believe in free trade.
- |
  

- Perhaps my words are too moralistic, too black and white.
- |
  

- But look at him&#8212;his face is a skull!
- |
  

- He sits on a throne made of bones.
- |
  

- This is an evil man, working in evil times.
- |
  

- "And I know, from various intelligence sources, including my trusted aide Man-at-Arms and my Security Adviser Generic-Noun-Name, that Skeletor has been working on a new weapon: a weapon that could destroy the nation."
- |
  

- You in the media don't believe me.
- |
  

- Some have cynically reported that I am using fear to gain votes.
- |
  

- If any members of the press corps wish to find out what Skeletor is up to, they can take a trip to Castle Grayskull, expenses paid from my Mattel stock options.
- |
  

- Any takers?
- |
  

- I didn't think so.
- Pundits and columnists have questioned my judgment, just because I used to run around without clothes on, saving people.
- |
  

- I've moved past that.
- |
  

- In your younger days, you don't live your life running for political office.
- |
  

- "What hasn't changed: I was a muscle-bound action figure then, and I'm a muscle-bound action figure now, dedicated to fighting  Skeletor."
- I should disclose at this time that I no longer receive any salary from Mattel, and I'm totally uninterested in their financial state.
- |
  

- I've severed all ties.
- |
  

- The idea that I might start a war so that Mattel could profit is ridiculous.
- |
  

- How could a toy company possibly profit from a war?
- The time is ripe for an attack.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Because if we don't attack now, Skeletor will attack first.
- |
  

- It is time to show who will be the Masters of the Universe.
- Raises sword .
- Thank you and God bless.
- |
  

- He-Man!
- Jem   It's Truly Outrageous that you've elected me to this position.
- |
  

- As many of you have learned from my memoir&#8212; Jem&#8212;Truly Revealing!
- |
  

- Armed with little more than great hair, superpower earrings, a keen fashion sense, and a sizable inheritance, I was able to make my way to be here with you today.
- |
  

- And I won't let you down.
- I believe it's in the interest of every American to fight file-sharing.
- |
  

- You may have heard of it, you may have done it.
- |
  

- But it's Truly Illegal!
- |
  

- The pirating of movies and music must be stopped.
- |
  

- These file-sharing hackers and spammers have no respect for other people's hard work, and they support terrorism.
- |
  

- Every song that you copy illegally winds up in the black markets of Kabul and Mogadishu&#8212;and if there's anything that terrorists love, it's American pop music.
- |
  

- And I plan to use our Truly Lethal military to track down and bomb the computers of all file-sharers, because what they're doing is terrible.
- As I stand here today, I pledge to protect the Constitution, improve life for working families, and remove the smut that has penetrated popular entertainment.
- |
  

- A few people with a lot of bad ideas have nearly destroyed the vast cultural heritage of the Reagan years, and I vow to end it, because I am Jem&#8212;Truly Republican!
- |
  

- Thank you and God bless.
- Lion-O   I was born here, but my parents were immigrants to this country.
- |
  

- Like most orange-skinned cat-people who come to this great nation, they opened a convenience store, where I bagged and delivered groceries after school.
- |
  

- I spent candlelit nights learning English and swordplay.
- |
  

- And it still overwhelms me that you could elect me to this position.
- But that is not enough.
- |
  

- Prejudice does not end here, at this podium.
- |
  

- Today it's a Thundercat, tomorrow it could be anyone!
- |
  

- This is a land of opportunity, not a land of calamity.
- |
  

- Don't let the melting pot boil over.
- Wait for applause .
- "Critics of my fledgling administration suggest that my cabinet is lopsided, that it\xB9s not the coalition I might have mentioned during the campaign, but rather a coterie of Thundercats that I've known my entire life."
- |
  

- And I ask you this&#8212;why shouldn't I surround myself with the people I know and trust?
- |
  

- My advisers will help this nation in its darkest hour, in the War on Mumm-Ra.
- He is, pure and simple, a terrorist.
- |
  

- A terrorist with terrible thoughts.
- |
  

- This isn't because he's a Muslim, or Egyptian, or a mummy with mutant strength.
- |
  

- The War on Mumm-Ra is the focal point of the War on Terror.
- |
  

- Let's put partisan politics aside.
- |
  

- Let's forget about the sex scandals.
- |
  

- Let's fight terror.
- Raises sword.
- Thank you and God bless.
- |
  

- Thundercats Ho!
- Optimus Prime   As the first robot/semitruck to be elected to these hallowed halls, I pledge to rebuild America.
- |
  

- To repair our crumbling roads and bridges, to lower gas prices, and to increase the speed limit.
- |
  

- Things that all Americans need.
- Our military is stretched too thin, and we need to increase spending to combat the Decepticon menace.
- |
  

- It will be expensive&#8212;the liberals and the media complain that $87 billion is too much to construct a fleet of vehicles that transform into fighting robots.
- |
  

- But we didn't ratify the Decepticon Proliferation Treaty, and now they're everywhere, threatening our very way of life.
- |
  

- And, might I remind you, not a single Decepticon is made in America.
- |
  

- The Central Intelligence Agency has suggested that some were built by the French.
- You may ask where this money is coming from.
- |
  

- We're going to audit the entire budget, and go from there.
- |
  

- We'll find a way; it will come from healthcare, and it will come from education.
- |
  

- "And for those who protest, let me say this: how do you plan on getting your school buses and your ambulances to where they need to go without roads?"
- |
  

- What will you do when a Decepticon double-parks next to your car?
- Some say that I've been pandering to special interest groups, that I'm in the pocket of the Big Three automakers.
- |
  

- That would have to be a pretty big pocket.
- |
  

- "But I'm a coalition builder: I was also endorsed by Big Oil, and Big Tires as well."
- |
  

- And I have the full support of the Teamsters.
- |
  

- As far as my environmental beliefs go, you might say that I'm the first hybrid.
- Waits for laughter .
- Let me say right now, public transportation is not feasible.
- |
  

- Can you imagine me on a subway?
- |
  

- Or a Segway?
- |
  

- And I'm not the only one.
- |
  

- "America is bigger now: all of those H2s out there, they need bigger roads, and bigger gas stations."
- Are we going to be ruled by a bunch of foreign-made Transformers?
- |
  

- No! We're going to pop the clutch on government!
- |
  

- We're going to jump-start the economy!
- |
  

- This administration will be More Than Meets the Eye.
- |
  

- Thank you and God bless.

As many of you have learned from my memoir&#8212; Jem&#8212;Truly Revealing! &#8212;it was a long hard road from the orphanage to become a rock star whose songs touch people's hearts.
