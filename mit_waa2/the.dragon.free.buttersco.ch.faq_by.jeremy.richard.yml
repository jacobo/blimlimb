- How do you make Dragon-Free Butterscotch?
- "Like all premium butterscotch, our blend of butter, cream, vanilla, and single-malt Scotch boils to the threshold of soft-crack texture, but we take it one step further: a dash of Bakunawa blood."

- The condensed life force of this Philippine serpent wards off all dragons within a 20-mile radius, sealing the dimensional fissures created by the butterscotch and filtering out any scales, fangs, or claws that may tear through.
- Is your Dragon-Free Butterscotch really dragon-free?
- Our butterscotch is certified by the FDA* to be at least 98 percent dragon-free.

- What does that mean to you?

- It means at last you and your family can enjoy a rich and creamy treat without an enormous winged serpent surging out of your spoon and scorching your dining-room table with the fury of Hades.
- How do dragons get inside my butterscotch in the first place?
- This confectionery curse dates back to medieval Scotland, when a butter farmer stumbled upon a lair near the River Oykel and found a pile of shedded scales shimmering near the riverbank.
- |
  

- He stole these scales and laced them onto a necklace for his daughter, which he presented to her as a wedding gift.
- |
  

- At the wedding reception, the Oykel dragon cast a dark shadow over the crowd and swooped down, grasping the necklace in its fangs and pulling the daughter with it.

- This started the thousand-year war between the butter farmer's family and the dragon's clan.

- The farm has since been replaced by a pudding factory.
