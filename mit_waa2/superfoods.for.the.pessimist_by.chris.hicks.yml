- |
  

- Add to salads and sandwiches for peppery flavor and laughable feelings of superiority.
- Dark Chocolate
- An excellent source of flavenoids, which lower cholesterol and prevent fatty deposits from building up in your arteries.
- |
  

- "Will keep your broken heart beating\x97as a second-to-second reminder that you are alone\x97long after you want it to stop."
- Whiskey
- Still the only friend you've ever had and the only home you'll ever know.

- That's priceless.
