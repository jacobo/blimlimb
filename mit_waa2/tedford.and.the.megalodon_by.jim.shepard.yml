- One of the lifting pallets had upset and spilled the crate down the side of the ship.

- His almanac had been saved, for which he was thankful.
- Among the losses had been his Simpson and his Eldredge; his  Osteology and Relationships of Chondrichthyans ; his  Boys' Book of Songs , Balfour's  Development of Elasmobranch Fishes , and, thrown in from his childhood, his Beadle Boys' Library, including  Wide Awake Ned; the Boy Wizard .
- Above his head, interstellar space was impossibly black.

- That night he wrote in his almanac,  Velvet set with piercing bits of light .

- There seemed to be, spread above him, some kind of galactic cloud arrangement.

- Stars arced up over one horizon and down the other.

- The water nearest the ice seemed disturbingly calm.

- Little wavelets lapped the prow of the nearest kayak.

- The cold was like a wind from the stars.
- "Thirty-three-year-old Roy Henry Tedford and his little pile of provisions were braced on the lee side of a talus slope on a speck of an island at somewhere around degree of longitude 146 and degree of latitude 58, seven hundred miles from Ad&eacute;lie Land on the Antarctic Coast, and four hundred from the nearest landfall on any official map: the unprepossessing dot of Macquarie Island to the east."

- It was a fine midsummer night in 1923.
- His island, one of three ice-covered rocks huddled together in a quarter mile chain, existed only on the hand-drawn chart that had brought him here, far from those few shipping lanes and fishing waters this far south.

- The chart was entitled, in Heuvelmans's barbed-wire handwriting, alongside his approximation of the location,  The Islands of the Dead .
- |
  

- Under that Heuvelmans had printed in block letters the aboriginal word  Kadimakara , or "Animals of the Dreamtime.
- Tedford's provisions included twenty-one pounds of hardtack, two tins of biscuit flour, a sack of sweets, a bag of dried fruit, a camp-stove, an oilskin wrap for his almanac, two small reading-lanterns, four jerry cans of kerosene, a waterproofed one-man tent, a bedroll, a spare coat and gloves, a spare set of Wellington boots, a knife, a small tool set, waterproofed and double-wrapped packets of matches, a box camera in a specially made mahogany case in an oilskin pouch, a revolver, and a Bland's .

- Axite Express.

- He'd fired the Bland's twice, and both times been knocked onto his back by the recoil.
- |
  

- The sportsman in Melbourne who'd sold it to him had assured him that it was the closest thing to field artillery that a man could put to his shoulder.
- He was now four hundred miles from sharing a wish, or a word, or a memory.

- If all went well, it might be two months before he again saw a friendly face.
