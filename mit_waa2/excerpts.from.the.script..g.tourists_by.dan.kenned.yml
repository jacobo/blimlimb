- The beach was the brainchild of Andrew Carnegie, who hated to leave New York but loved to take a tropical vacation.

- Carnegie made his millions in steel and gave most of it away, but the one indulgence in luxury he allowed himself was the nine-acre  white sand beach and underground "virtual ocean," which was  the equivalent of six Olympic-sized swimming pools, with four wave machines custom-built in Tokyo, Japan. It was a rather diplomatic gesture to join hands with Japan to make Carnegie's secret hide-away a reality. Rumor has it that at least one acre of white sand and almost half of the now motionless ocean are still here under Minetta Lane [gesture to any portion of the ground]. The last time it was accessed was in 1941 when the wave machines and 175,000 candlepower "sun" were taken out and turned into weapons in our war against Japan, ironically.

  MINETTA LANE  (Secret beach!)
  Ssshhh! Can you hear it? Some people think on a quiet
  day you can still hear the elite of New York frolicking
  in the city's best-kept secret: an underground white
  sand beach! The beach was the brainchild of Andrew
  Carnegie, who hated to leave New York but loved to
  take a tropical vacation. Carnegie made his millions
  in steel and gave most of it away, but the one
  indulgence in luxury he allowed himself was the nine-acre 
  white sand beach and underground "virtual ocean," which was
   the equivalent of six Olympic-sized swimming
  pools, with four wave machines custom-built in Tokyo, Japan.
  It was a rather diplomatic gesture to join hands with
  Japan to make Carnegie's secret hide-away a reality.
  Rumor has it that at least one acre of white sand and
  almost half of the now motionless ocean are still here
  under Minetta Lane [gesture to any portion of the
  ground]. The last time it was accessed was in 1941
  when the wave machines and 175,000 candlepower "sun"
  were taken out and turned into weapons in our war
  against Japan, ironically.
  BLEECKER AND MacDOUGAL  (Southwest corner)
  Everyone knows that this is the corner Thomas Edison
  sat on when discouraged from his failed attempts at
  illuminating the light bulb in his Bleecker Street
  lab, but what you probably don't know is this: The man
  who Edison would share his frustrations with...the man
  who owned and worked at this very cafe [gesture to any
  nearby cafe] was a man the country would later
  come to recognize as its President. This used to be
  called the Lincoln Cafe, named after its owner... an
  honest man, with a love of European coffee, named Abe.
  Today the cafe is owned By Jerry Seinfeld and CC
  DeVille of the rock band Poison, and as a reminder
  of the cafe's heritage, Jerry and CC have lit the
  cafe's entire interior with incandescent single-filament 
  bulbs...the very bulb that Edison finally
  triumphed over innumerable obstacles to bring to Bleecker
  Street... [dramatic pause] ...and the world.
  WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK
  Who knows where we're standing? [Let someone give
  the obvious answer.] Well, did you know that before it
  was a park, Washington Square was the place where our
  country's forefathers would meet and mingle dressed as
  women? One of the most secret societies in America met
  here monthly at midnight for three years right around
  the turn of the century. In what was considered a
  bawdy way to blow off steam, pretty corsets and
  flowery talk were donned as the evening's attire and
  the men giggled and preened and socialized. And, some
  would say, even retired to the rowhouses you see
  behind you [gesture to West Third] to share a spot of
  tea or brandy and tips on making themselves appear to
  be the fairest maidens of the Village. You'll never
  find it in a history book, but the story is that one
  night a police officer who was new on the beat didn't
  know enough to look the other way. During one of these
  little "tea parties" the officer took it upon himself

  of Georgette W. took a fancy to the policeman, and the
  rest is history. The secret was in danger of getting

  went "Ladies' Night" and in came more manly
  chess tables and benches for drinking. As years
  passed, the past was put to sleep. [Make a joke about
  the next woman who passes by possibly being the Mayor.]
  IN FRONT OF UNIVERSITY BOOKSTORE
  Who has seen the movie "Big"? What about "Jaws" and
  "Say Anything"? Are you sure you still don't recognize
  this bookstore? [Usually some star-struck tourist will

  lights and signs used in the scene. Bogart's lighting
  stand-in, who was a dead ringer for Bogey, reported to
  the set for test lighting. When he stepped onto his
  (Bogey's) mark, he was electrocuted. Everyone

  shed over a dead felon. Hollywood was so embarrassed
  at the oversight and ensuing rumors that Samuel
  Goldwyn vowed to never show the storefront in film
  "As long as Hollywood lived."
