- "Q: You've said that you want your movies to look as fake as possible."
- |
  

- What do you mean?
- "Christopher Hide: Well, I just think the whole Dogma 95 thing has gone much, much too far."
- |
  

- No offense to Richard Linklater, but just look at  Tape  &#151; three people in a small, dimly lit hotel room for two hours.
- |
  

- Not much there.
- |
  

- Since when did ugliness become so highly regarded?
- "Q: Okay, but  Tape  is not officially a Dogma film, is it?"
- "Hide: Whatever."
- |
  

- You know what I mean.
- |
  

- It amounts to a Dogma film.
- |
  

- The washed out, faded look.
- |
  

- Natural light.
- |
  

- Nothing artificial, supposedly.
- |
  

- But it all seems rather far-fetched, doesn't it?
- |
  

- The overwrought emotion.
- |
  

- Dancer in the Dark,   Gummo,   The Celebration,   Blair Witch,   Time Code.
- |
  

- I'm weary of movies that look real.
- |
  

- I want the old fakery back.
- |
  

- Isn't that what movies are all about?
- "Q: What kind of movies do you have in mind?"
- "Hide: Anything from the 1950s or 60s."
- |
  

- Hitchcock, for example.
- |
  

- At least you always know you're watching a movie with a Hitchcock film.
- |
  

- Take the scene in  The Birds,  with Tippi Hedren against the wall with her back to the camera and the birds coming at her.
- |
  

- Hitchcock really threw live birds at her, did you know?
- "Q: So today's movies have no style?"
- "Hide: Sure they do."
- |
  

- I'm not saying that.
- |
  

- But in the service of realism, not illusion.
- |
  

- You know what the fakest movie ever made was?
- |
  

- Superfly.
- |
  

- Of course it's &#151; well you know, it's a movie about blacks kicking some white ass, so it's never gotten the recognition it deserves.
- |
  

- There's one great chase scene in an alley, and the strap from the camera falls down in front of the lens, and someone's hand comes into the frame for a split second to pull it away.
- "Q: Any others?"
- "Hide: Well, there's  The Others."
- |
  

- Absolutely unreal.
- |
  

- You never believe it for a moment.
- |
  

- Never.
- |
  

- And my new one,  The Benders.
- "Q: Can we talk a little bit about that?"
- "Hide: Oh, and  Insomnia."
- |
  

- The remake.
- |
  

- Not one ounce of reality.
- |
  

- Or the entire  Tennenbaum  movie.
- "Q: Can I ask you about a scene in  The Benders ?"
- "Hide: Sure."
- "Q: It's near the end of the film, and Paul is supposed to be dreaming about the man with the knife outside his house, but there's a flaw when he wakes up and &#151;"
- "Hide: It's not a flaw."
- |
  

- There's a big difference between flaw and fake.
- |
  

- I'd like to think there's clarity in that difference.
- "Q: Right, I don't mean to fault the film, but the scene we're talking about, how could Paul have known in his dream &#151; if it was a dream &#151; that there really was a man outside his house?"
- "Hide: I don't understand what that has to do with being fake."
- |
  

- Please, Nick.
- |
  

- Let me just say, the scene is supposed to be like that.
- |
  

- See, that's the whole problem with this craze for reality and the real.
- |
  

- Now people expect it in everything they see.
- |
  

- The pressure is enormous.
- |
  

- Well, I'm sorry, not everything is real, and not everything that's not real is bad.
- "Q: You're defending illusion?"
- "Hide: It's underrated, sure."
- |
  

- In the sense of we want everything to look real now.
- |
  

- The real is unchecked.
- |
  

- I'm not one of those militants or anything, but it's got to be stopped.
- |
  

- It's finally impossible to live up to.
- |
  

- Illusion has lost its charm, and that's a shame.
- |
  

- It truly is.
- |
  

- I'm proud to say that  The Benders  doesn't have one real-looking scene in it.
- |
  

- I realize it sounds kind of ridiculous to say that.
- |
  

- But it's time to start having some fun again.
- "Q: I heard you had some problems with cameras on  The Benders."
- |
  

- Care to talk about that?
- "Hide: Not really."
- |
  

- I mean, I can laugh about it now, sort of, but it really wasn't funny at the time.
- "Q: I take it they just kept breaking?"
- "Hide: Yeah."
- |
  

- And stolen.
- |
  

- But mostly breaking.
- |
  

- One or two breaking over the course of a shoot, that's understandable, right?
- |
  

- But seventeen?
- "Q: That's got to be more than coincidence."
- "Hide: Tell me about it."
- "Q: Sabotage?"
- "Hide: [No response]"
- "Q: I take it you don't want to go into that."
- "Hide: [Silence]"
- "Q: Okay."
- |
  

- So I hear you were a visiting professor for a semester last year.
- |
  

- How was that?
- "Hide: Oh, it was fun."
- |
  

- Everyone was very gracious and understanding.
- |
  

- I taught a film class at Detroit University.
- |
  

- They wanted reality, I gave them hoaxes.
- |
  

- In big doses.
- |
  

- Everything I did was against proof and truth.
- |
  

- We watched  Dead Man  seven times.
- "Q: Symbolic?"
- "Hide: What?"
- "Q: The number seven."
- |
  

- You've mentioned it several times.
- "Hide: Have I? Coincidence."
- |
  

- I just want to say one more thing &#151; the sooner we dispense with the illusion of reality, especially in movies, the better.
- |
  

- I don't mean to sound moralistic or anything, but I just don't see what it can lead to except greater and greater discontentment.
- |
  

- And that's why I continue to make films, to offer some kind of alternative, albeit an imperfect one.
- |
  

- You know, cinema has worked for over a hundred years to break free from the shackles of documentary, and now all that works is being undone by the Dogmatists and the like.
- |
  

- I just want to offer an alternative to that, that's all.
- |
  

- The truth is, I don't have a choice.
- |
  

- My back is against the wall.
- |
  

- Do you know what I mean?
- |
  

- Does that make sense to you?
- |
