- Surrounded by low-rise apartment buildings, Loofa's Black Castle is easily identified.

- "You should use the Plea if you need an enormous favor: something that's illegal, outside protocol, or too complicated to explain without a half hour of expository dialogue."

- At first, he'll be skeptical, displaying a shake of the head or an eye roll, but, as you speak, his cavalier expression will morph to one of concern.

- He'll shake his head once more, as if to suggest that he'd like to agree but that the system would never let him get away with it.

- Eventually, the target's mouth will become a straight line and you'll recognize the look of grim determination.
