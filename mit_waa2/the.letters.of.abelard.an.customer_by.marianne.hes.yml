- Dear Valued Customer Heloise,
- "When you walked into the Mattress Depot, I knew that I must sell you a mattress\x97for I am the world's best salesman, and you the finest customer."
- |
  

- Never for an instant do I believe you will turn to my peddling rivals, for their mattresses are but lumpy, and you require ultra-plush or pillow-top.
- |
  

- Pray tell me you have not sacrificed your dignity, and will return so we might lie together and try out the beds.
- |
  

- All I dream of is gratifying you.
- Your devoted salesman,
- Abelard
- |
  

- To the World's Best Salesman,
- You grant me incredible satisfaction, but, alas, the Depot does not carry the mattress I desire.
- |
  

- In truth, it is not so much that I desire it as that my uncle believes it offers superior lumbar support.
- |
  

- I must apologize, Abelard; my uncle is a controlling man.
- |
  

- Plus, he's paying for it.
- With deepest regrets,
- Heloise
- |
  

- To Heloise, Who Will Not Let Me Down,
- "No! I cannot bear it\x97the thought of you turning to my enemies in pursuit of your intimate requirements."
- |
  

- "You must remember, Heloise: another salesman may have your mattress in stock, but he can only sell it to you."
- |
  

- To him, it is little more than a thing shoved into your minivan.
- |
  

- If I sold it, every inch of me would be in tune with the universal splendor of each fiber.
- |
  

- Your mattress would not only be delivered; it would be transported.
- |
  

- So please, I beg, wait and the merchandise you seek shall arrive.
- Devoted as ever,
- Abelard
- |
  

- To My Special Salesman,
- While it pains me to disregard my uncle, I cannot deny you.
- |
  

- "When this letter arrives, you will only then be ordering the Simmons Beautyrest, yet I already count the days\x97until I see you again."
- |
  

- Also, what do you offer by way of comforter sets?
- Your finest,
- Heloise
- |
  

- To My Most Valued Customer,
- I'm afraid the mattress you seek cannot be ordered, for it contradicts company guidelines.
- |
  

- Were I to purchase it, I would be shunned by my managers and cast into the street.
- |
  

- The transgression would precede me, wherever I interviewed.
- |
  

- "Nevertheless, I would sacrifice it all\x97fame, wealth, invitations to cocktail parties\x97to sell you what you desire."
- |
  

- My rivals are but trifling men, Heloise; they would surely turn you away.
- |
  

- But I am no mere mattress salesman.
- |
  

- I am the only genuine Mattress Salesman.
- Yours forever,
- Abelard
- |
  

- To the Supposedly Genuine Mattress Salesman,
- I want to believe you are sincere, but I am starting to doubt.
- |
  

- "Three months ago, you vowed to purchase my mattress, and still\x97nothing."
- |
  

- Do you even have the  equipment  to transport it?
- |
  

- Then today, whilst on an errand, I glanced into your window.
- |
  

- I have given myself to you and you alone, yet there you were, handing over your king-size Posturepedic to every curvy brunette hussy with an open checkbook.
- |
  

- I cannot help but think you never cared to satisfy me, only yourself.
- |
  

- The least you can do is waive the delivery charge.
- A dissatisfied customer who needs her Beautyrest,
- Heloise
- |
  

- My Perfect Hel,
- Do not let your skepticism guide you, for I remain determined to have you on this mattress within the fortnight.
- |
  

- True, I probably sought to satisfy myself first.
- |
  

- But, as always, you are next in line.
- |
  

- If you only knew the torment I have endured these many months.
- |
  

- My mind swims with thoughts of your mattress, and not just because I nap on waterbeds and memory foam.
- |
  

- The trainees go untrained.
- |
  

- The boy wanting the race-car bed leaves weeping each weekend.
- |
  

- "I shredded the Sealy arrivals, for their boxy contours reminded me of you\x97yet they were not yours."
- |
  

- Yes, there was that one brunette .
- |
  

- I was so preoccupied I failed to include the tax upon her receipt.
- |
  

- My warehouse minions must think me a fool.
- |
  

- But I will never hide my devotion.
- |
  

- The CEO insisted I cancel the order, and I laughed in his face.
- Yours only,
- Abelard
- |
  

- Dear Abelard,
- My uncle has read your letter and wishes me to break off our transaction.
- |
  

- I said I could not, for a 15 percent fee would result.
- |
  

- But he thinks word of our union will disseminate and lead to scandal.
- |
  

- I can demand no more.
- |
  

- Go now, and redeem yourself in the eyes of your CEO.
- |
  

- You're not just any man, Abelard; you're a Mattress Salesman, too noble to doze on anything but plywood, deserving of the condescending tone you take with us, the tired masses, who trudge to your store seeking comfort.
- I am sorry I have caused you to stoop so low.
- |
  

- Alas, I will take your mattress, but I will never sign the remainder of the contract.
- |
  

- Surely this will thwart scandal.
- Ever your finest,
- Heloise
- |
  

- Your Last Letter Torments Me, Heloise,
- For your mattress has arrived, and I was about to recommend that you stop by so we might test its springs.
- |
  

- "Now this proposal that we part ways\x97it cuts straight to my natural-latex core."
- |
  

- I'm afraid that, for my suffering, I will require nothing less than 20 percent.
- Devoted as ever,
- Abelard
- |
  

- Dear Salesman No. 27 at Mattress Depot,
- I must apologize for the spectacle my uncle caused in your store.
- |
  

- Having those goons cut off your tongue so you can no longer haggle correctly was a step too far.
- |
  

- Thanks for the lovely mattress, though.
- Heloise
- |
  

- Dear Former Salesman No. 27,
- "Though it has been many years since you sold me my mattress, and though I have repented for my past indulgences\x97especially my insistence on 1,500-count Egyptian sheets\x97I still think of you."
- |
  

- I hear you are traveling now, selling your mattresses door-to-door, in constant fear that your rivals will take you out to the curb.
- |
  

- "But I simply must know: is there a way to remove a giant whiskey stain from the mattress pad?"
- |
  

- Also, why the hell did you sell me a full-size Serta when I specifically asked for a queen-size Simmons?
- |
  

- Maybe one day we shall meet and ponder these dilemmas.
- |
  

- When you find the time, please stop by.
- |
  

- I will unfold the couch for you.
- Heloise
