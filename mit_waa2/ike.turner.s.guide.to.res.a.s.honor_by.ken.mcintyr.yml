- OK, America, you done fucked up again.
- |
  

- Things got a little out of hand, and you went and blew up another country.
- |
  

- Now you got everybody all mad at you, and you don't know what to do.
- |
  

- Well, don't worry, America.
- |
  

- Ike's been down this road before, and I know exactly how to handle it.
- |
  

- You better listen to what I'm telling you, America.
- |
  

- Ike knows what he's talking about, and Ike's willing to help you out as long as you do exactly what Ike says and stop being so stubborn.
- |
  

- You dig?
- Step 1
- OK, first things first, America.
- |
  

- Stop smacking the bitch.
- |
  

- I know sometimes you get caught up in the heat of the moment and you don't know when you've gone too far.
- |
  

- Sometimes you just get so mad sometimes.
- |
  

- I know you tried to warn Iraq.
- |
  

- You told Iraq to stop provoking you.
- |
  

- But Iraq wouldn't listen.
- |
  

- Iraq was being stubborn and ignorant, and you had to teach Iraq a lesson.
- |
  

- Now Iraq's all beaten and bruised and bleeding everywhere, fucking up the good carpet.
- |
  

- It's time to chill the fuck out, America.
- |
  

- You don't wanna kill Iraq.
- |
  

- You just wanna show Iraq how much you love it.
- |
  

- It's just sometimes you go a little crazy is all.
- Step 2
- Give Iraq a Kleenex and tell it to clean itself up.
- |
  

- Tell Iraq to hurry, you ain't got all day.
- Step 3
- Now comes the hard part.
- |
  

- You've got to apologize to Iraq, America.
- |
  

- Even if you don't really mean it, you've got to swallow your pride and say the words "I'm sorry, baby.
- "\" Tell Iraq that sometimes America just gets so mad sometimes, and things get out of hand."
- |
  

- America doesn't mean to hurt Iraq.
- |
  

- America just wants to teach Iraq a lesson, because America loves Iraq so much, baby.
- |
  

- America knows what's best for Iraq, and if Iraq would just listen and stop being so stubborn, it could be the best country in the world.
- Step 4
- Surprise Iraq with a little present.
- |
  

- How about .
- |
  

- Get all your friends together and make a big celebration out of it.
- |
  

- Offer Iraq a little tiny slice of democracy for the cameras.
- |
  

- Wait a minute!
- |
  

- What's that?
- |
  

- Iraq doesn't want your democracy?
- |
  

- Tell Iraq it better take a bite of democracy, dammit.
- |
  

- C'mon, Iraq, don't disappoint America in front of all these people.
- |
  

- C'mon, have some democracy, you low-down dirty ho!
- If Iraq asks you to leave it alone, just raise your fist and tell it to stop being all uppity.
- |
  

- If Iraq still fights back, well, you're gonna have to teach Iraq a lesson.
- Step 5
- OK, you did it again.
- |
  

- Now you done put Iraq in the hospital.
- |
  

- Maybe it's time to do some soul-searching and find out if maybe the problem isn't with you.
- |
  

- Promise Iraq that you're gonna try and get some help with your oil addiction and that you'll be a better country from now on.
- |
  

- Oil makes you do some crazy things sometimes.
- |
  

- Things you tend to regret later.
- |
  

- You're gonna have to cut that shit out for good.
- |
  

- You dig?
- Step 6
- Hey, I never said you had to quit cold turkey.
- |
  

- Guzzle that shit down and drive over to Iraq's house and start busting up the joint, for old times' sake.
- Step 7
- OK, by now Iraq's probably threatening to kill your ass if you don't leave it alone.
- |
  

- I know it's tough, but at some point you're gonna have to learn how to let go.
- |
  

- It's gonna bruise the shit out of your ego, and other countries are probably gonna look down on you for the next few decades, but it has to be done.
- |
  

- It'll allow Iraq to blossom into its own beautiful country, and it'll give you a chance to focus on improving yourself for a change.
- |
  

- You used to be really great, remember?
- |
  

- Think of all the amazing things you've done in the past.
- |
  

- You went a little nuts there for a few years, but it's never too late to get back on track.
- |
  

- Eventually, the world will learn to respect you again.
- |
  

- They'll follow your example and learn from your mistakes.
- And if it makes you feel any better, one day Iraq will probably star in a really shitty Mel Gibson movie.
- Peace,
- Ike

  Step 1
  OK, first things first, America. Stop smacking the bitch. I know sometimes you get caught up in the heat of the moment and you don't know when you've gone too far. Sometimes you just get so mad sometimes. I know you tried to warn Iraq. You told Iraq to stop provoking you. But Iraq wouldn't listen. Iraq was being stubborn and ignorant, and you had to teach Iraq a lesson. Now Iraq's all beaten and bruised and bleeding everywhere, fucking up the good carpet.
