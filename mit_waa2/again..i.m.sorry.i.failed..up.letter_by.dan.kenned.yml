- Why are they/he refusing to move on from a mistake I admit having made with their money?

- Then, after the questions stopped racing through my head, I felt compassion for you.

- "And trust me when I say it's not an easy thing to feel after a blurry six months of submitting to humiliating, pharmaceutically induced sexual scenarios with my then fianc\xE9e (sex worker) involving wigs, electric razors, prosthetics, and something called phenylpropan-ephedrine hydrochloride, which she simply referred to as \"Rush."
- "\" And the reason I feel compassion for you is because I know now, after receiving you or your legal representation's reply to my previous letter, that you're not willing to become wealthy again."

- And there's nothing I can do for you, if you're not willing.

- So I continue my  self-chosen  leave of absence from financial services.

- I'm spending some time getting out of New York City and driving through the mountains, tracing a path from Bozeman, Montana, all the way through the Rockies and clear down to Taos, New Mexico; town to town in a rented RV, drinking/working my way through the feelings on the nights when I'm not driving, and pondering a higher power and my true calling as I drive during the days.

  I've received voicemail, e-mail, or other communication from you, your spouse, or legal representation indicating that you won't be loaning me the money necessary to repair the/my missteps taken with our initial investment undertaking.

And trust me when I say it's not an easy thing to feel after a blurry six months of submitting to humiliating, pharmaceutically induced sexual scenarios with my then fianc\xE9e (sex worker) involving wigs, electric razors, prosthetics, and something called phenylpropan-ephedrine hydrochloride, which she simply referred to as \"Rush.\" And the reason I feel compassion for you is because I know now, after receiving you or your legal representation's reply to my previous letter, that you're not willing to become wealthy again.
