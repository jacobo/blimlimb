  Customer service at the Karaoke Don Quixote is main thing we worry about.  
  Because if customer doesn't go here, will
  go elsewhere, and soon no customers go here period.  We treat them special.
   We feign bad foreign accent to make feel better.  We not decide on particular
  region&#151;because if customer is from said particular region, or customer's
  family is, is no good, no?  No.  Is no good.  Is little Italian, little
  Polack, little bit here and there.  Is good.
  Because it gets customer singing.  Customer service is number one priority
  for us.  We say, You sing, you sing!  Is person drinking?  Yes!  Is good,
  for beer and spirits make person sing, and people singing is good:  They
  buy more beer and spirits.  And intoxication is good because is no cover
  charge.  Is good, because people like singing great works of literature,
  and is good because they drink more, so more profits.
  First we start with  Don Quixote.   But soon we branch to postmodernist
  stuff, because customers want, and customers is always accurate:  They say,
  Barth!  Barthelme!  Pynchon!  Coover!  We say, OK.  We say, is good.  Also
  postmodernists drink.  Minimalists, they don't drink so much.  Is poetry
  good?  No, is no good.  Poetry karaoke, is like haiku, sonatinas&#151;no
  good, no one sings.  Classic is good:  Melville and Tolstoy and some other
  peoples&#151;big hits, big big hits.
  Is reason for accent?  Is annoying you?  Logic?  Logic is, these are shy
  peoples&#151;literature peoples is shy.  Is sitting around reading, no much
  dancing, maybe some drinking and then dancing, but stiff, you know?  Is
  people reading travel, you know?  The New York Times travel section?  Also
  travelogues and such.  Is dreaming of going elsewhere, maybe finding charming
  out-of-the-way spots with kindly innkeepers, lovely foreign women, also
  big motherly types that feed them exotic soups and ales and such.  And maybe,
  in this fantasy of going places, they're thinking they might let go a little
  because no one knows them, right?  So we feed that fantasy a little.  Is
  good, is people happy.  Is good business.  People sing:  They sing  Quixote:
  &laquo; En un lugar de la Mancha, de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme, no ha mucho
  tiempo que viv&iacute;a un hidalgo de los de lanza en astillero, adarga antigua,
  roc&iacute;n flaco y galgo corredor.&nbsp;&raquo;
  Or sing dubbed international public domain version:
  "In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
  mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
  in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing."

  Soon:  IPO.  T-shirts.  Web site.  CDs.  Is good!
