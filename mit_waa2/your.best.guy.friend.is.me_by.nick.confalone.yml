- Hello, beautiful woman!
- |
  

- Do you like shopping?
- |
  

- You do?
- |
  

- Then let us go to the local shopping mall and I will watch you try on serapes at the Anthropologie store.
- |
  

- I did not know there were so many different kinds of serape!
- |
  

- Yes, please model them for me!
- |
  

- You will try them on and sometimes I will say I like them, but sometimes I will say I do not.
- |
  

- Don't take my serape evaluation too seriously, though, because these are just random things I say since I don't really care.
- |
  

- No, I am kidding.
- |
  

- Of course I care.
- |
  

- You look wonderful.
- Beautiful woman, come in my house!
- |
  

- Why are you crying?
- |
  

- Oh, no!
- |
  

- When did he tell you?
- |
  

- That is because he is stupid.
- |
  

- I never liked that boy.
- |
  

- Here, let me hug you.
- |
  

- Now my hug has filled your heart with gladness, but not the kind of gladness that leads to sexual encounters.
- |
  

- Now let us consume ice cream while watching the television.
- |
  

- I think  Sex and the City  is on.
- |
  

- Yes, it is my favorite, too.
- No, beautiful woman, I was frowning because I thought of something that is sad but completely unrelated to what we are talking about.
- |
  

- Look, I am smiling now.
- |
  

- And, yes, I would much rather go hiking with you than watch the Eagles game.
- Why so glum, chum?
- |
  

- Don't worry, I shall dance the night away with you when no other boys will do so.
- |
  

- Here, look how I flail my arms to make you laugh.
- |
  

- "And look at this: if I don't bend my knees I will dance like a robot!"
- |
  

- "Giggle while I speak in my silly robot voice: ZZZT ZZZT I AM A ROBOT!"
- |
  

- Now laugh and tell me to dance normal!
- |
  

- Say it!
- |
  

- Tell me to dance, clown, dance!
- Hello?
- |
  

- No, I was not asleep.
- |
  

- Of course I will come pick you up at the party.
- |
  

- Four guys?
- |
  

- Why not?
- |
  

- Well, he should have given you a ride home.
- |
  

- If we ever made out, I would take you home.
- |
  

- Huh?
- |
  

- No, nothing.
- |
  

- Wow, you sure are a hoot tonight.
- |
  

- Please stop yelling into the phone; I'm almost there.
- |
  

- OK.
- |
  

- Get in.
- |
  

- How many shots?
- |
  

- Wow.
- |
  

- OK, please stop trying to open the door; it is locked.
- |
  

- Also the window.
- |
  

- They are both locked.
- |
  

- Because I locked them.
- |
  

- Gosh, I can't wait to sleep next to you tonight.
- |
  

- I will be careful not to touch any part of your body in a sexual manner, and in the morning I will gladly clean up any vomit that may have accumulated on my bed and/or toothbrush.
- We are laughing and having so much fun!
- |
  

- You are?
- |
  

- I am tipsy also!
- |
  

- "Now listen: I want to have sex with you."
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- No! Of course I'm kidding!
- |
  

- That could hurt our friendship and that is what I value most of all.
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- Hm?
- |
  

- Oh, is that your cell phone ringing?
- |
  

- If it is Suicidal Loneliness calling, it's for me.
- |
  

- No, I'm kidding again.
- |
  

- Now give me the phone so I can stab the antenna through my eye.
- |
