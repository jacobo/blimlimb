  PRINCESS DIANA
  I don't think anyone could dispute that the death of Princess Diana was
  a
  great human tragedy -- senseless, brutal, horrific. But just think how
  much
  more of a tragedy it would have been, had she been en route to

  Go ahead, laugh at Emmanuel Lewis. Laugh all you want. Okay, you can
  stop
  now. No, really, cut it out. Certainly, the tiny former TV star may not
  seem like a serious personage. But perhaps all of it -- the role on
  "Webster",
  the subsequent decline from the public eye, the occasional tabloid
  story -- has all been a ruse, designed to keep the American public from
  discovering the truth: that Emmanuel Lewis has been single-handedly
  managing the nation's economy for over twenty years. Think about it:
  Let's
  say that you're the greatest economic genius the world has yet produced.
  
  And yet, you're doomed to always look like an adorable ten-year-old. Do
  you
  attempt to become chairman of the Fed all by yourself? Or do you hire a
  series of amiable character actors to play the role of the Fed chief,
  all
  the while quietly pulling the strings behind the scenes, conveniently
  arranging a TV role for yourself to explain the vast riches you're
  accumulating? Think about it.
