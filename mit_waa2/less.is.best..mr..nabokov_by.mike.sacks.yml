- You have to leave something to the imagination of the reader, especially these days.

- In the past, this overly descriptive writing has worked, but sadly, we live in an era where the attention span (even of a voracious reader) is not quite what it used to be.

- But as you can see, the sentences are shorter and there is more definite nouns.
- Towards the end of the story, you start using "I" quite a bit. It seemed like this was mostly the character's thoughts, but the effort you were making was to use the outside world to describe what your character is thinking and feeling. This is a challenge to do, but I definitely think you have the groundwork laid to pull that off, however, when you started using "I" it again has the effect of pulling the reader out of the story.
- I hope this [critique] has been useful and not to brief.
- The final sentence of a manuscript [should be] followed by the word "END.
