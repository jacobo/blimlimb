  In which I set out to write a novel detailing my unsteady course through 
  life, which began promisingly in the cosseted suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland; 
  moved through a childhood characterized by the sturdy but not overbearing 
  love of both parents and the evident but not embarrassing admiration of a 
  younger sister; rocketed through an entertaining and rewarding adolescence 
  filled with academic, cultural, and athletic achievement that was shattered 
  irretrievably by the death in a car accident of my younger sister when she 
  was sixteen and I was eighteen; spent six months mourning her, not only in 
  death, but mourning her retroactively in life, as it became apparent after 
  her accident that she was hardly the model of sweetness and decorum I thought 
  I knew but instead a rather wild girl who was, at the time of her accident, 
  sky-high on angel dust and going down on a thirty-two year-old real estate 
  agent who was in the process of driving her to a model house in Virginia for 
  their regularly scheduled Thursday afternoon tryst; paused briefly in a 
  hospital, not physical but mental, for exhaustion brought on by recurring 
  dreams of murdering the real-estate agent, who was cleared of all charges in 
  the accident and went on to become something of a tycoon in the neighborhood, 
  developing several townhouse complexes, including the one in which I now 
  live; then picked up again with a series of entertainingly self-destructive 
  romances, one succeeding the other in such rapid succession that, viewed 
  together they acquire the feel of silent screen comedy; and finally came to 
  rest on the smooth, cool brow of a woman I met in a flower shop. (I was there 
  buying flowers for another woman, a woman who was in fact my wife, but whose 
  goodwill toward me had grown so attenuated that calling her my wife was akin

  doctor was later to tell me was laughably destructive to what he 
  euphemistically called my "physical well-being," given that it robbed me of 
  proper sleep and also introduced a mild toxin into my bloodstream), saw her

  then ran into her in a movie theatre, then began to see again, first for a

  which she and I would spend a single evening together each week, building on 
  our goodwill, ignoring the fact that I was still in something of a muddle and 
  that she not only had the same name as my sister, but shared her hair color,

  to say, "grade A tits," and that she wasn't too shabby in the other 
  departments either)), all contributing to a similarity between the two women 
  that, had I had any foresight at all, I would have seen as psychologically

  on a. . . cloud?. . . no. . . a raft?. . . no. . . a flying carpet of goodwill, trusting that my 
  love for her would at length prevail.
