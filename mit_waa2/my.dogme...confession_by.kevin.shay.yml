  Brethren in the cinematic revolution!
  It was with great heart that I unveiled to you and to the world my latest cinematic venture, "The Sins of the Stepdaughters," and issued a solemn declaration that this feature film was made in accordance with the tenets of the Dogme95 Manifesto.
  Inspired by the Dogme95 "Vows of Chastity" to shed every vestige of my former corrupt directorial habits, I shot on location (mostly at my grandmother's house), using only natural visuals and ambient sound.
  However, certain critics have questioned the extent to which I adhered to the rules of the Manifesto in making this film. Their comments fill me with remorse, and my conscience compels me to clarify certain aspects of my production, by way of confessing a number of transgressions against the Vows.
  In an early scene depicting a full-dress ball, the "catering hall" was in fact my grandmother's dining room, and that dear old woman (grand d&#226;me of etiquette that she is) provided matching eveningwear for some 400 guests. We tried to tell her a seven-course meal was unnecessary, but Grandma has never been one to let even the lowliest extra go hungry.
