- I was minding my own business.
- I was at home watching television.
- The show was a police drama.
- Everyone told me that it was fantastic.
- I didn't see the appeal.
- The older detective was always shouting at the younger detective.
- The younger detective was always chomping at the bit to solve the cases quickly.
- Their female sergeant wore her uniform comically tight.
- The first ten minutes bored me so much I almost fell asleep.
- I went out for a walk.
- The spring air buoyed my mood, as did the spring trees.
- I walked by a park.
- I walked by a statue that reminded me of a woman.
- I called that woman on the telephone.
- She was home.
- This surprised me, because I thought she had moved out of town.
- I asked her if I could come over.
- She said that would be nice.
- She told me she was married.
- I reminded her that she had been married throughout our time together.
- She laughed.
- She hung up the phone.
- I bought a bottle of dry white wine and went to her apartment.
- She opened the door before I knocked.
- She was wearing a man's dress shirt and women's underwear.
- She said she was psychic.
- Then she said she wasn't psychic, somewhat apologetically.
- She said that she had seen me on the security camera.
- I told her that I knew she wasn't psychic.
- I told her that if she was really psychic she wouldn't have gotten married to her husband.
- She told me not to mention him.
- I went to the kitchen to open the wine.
- She went to the couch and turned on the television.
- The same show that I had been watching at home was still on.
- She said it was a two-hour season finale.
- I didn't say anything.
- She said she loved the show more than life itself.
- I didn't say anything.
- We sat and watched the show.
- The younger detective was certain he knew where the killer was hiding.
- The older detective had his head buried in a file.
- The female sergeant kissed the younger detective in a stairwell.
- The older detective drank too much and looked at himself reproachfully in the mirror.
- The killer got a job mopping floors in the police station.
- The female sergeant had a dream that the younger detective shot and killed the older detective.
- I poured us more wine and moved closer to her on the couch.
- The outside of her thigh had a noticeable pulse that I always said was her leg's heartbeat.
- She always told me that if it was pulsing that much on the outside of her leg I should feel the inside.
- I did during the commercial, briefly.
- When the show came back on she told me to stop.
- She asked me what I thought would happen.
- I said that I thought that the female sergeant's dream would come true.
- She said no.
- She said that the female sergeant had dreams every episode and they never came true.
- She said they were supposed to be read as clues for future cases but that they had nothing to do with this episode's case.
- I asked if the female detective was psychic.
- She said that's what she meant by saying that her dreams were clues to future cases.
- She told me to be quiet so we could watch the show.
- A baby I did not recognize was rescued by a woman I did not recognize.
- A man I did not recognize beat another man I did not recognize with a tire-iron.
- This elicited a gasp from the woman.
- She said that Eric might die.
- I said that was too bad but that I would feel worse if I knew who Eric was.
- A boy on a bicycle rode straight at the camera, ringing his bicycle bell excitedly.
- She asked me if it was bell time already.
- I told her I didn't know what she meant.
- She explained that ten minutes before the end of every show the boy on the bicycle appeared.
- She told me that the last ten minutes were always a doozy and this was a way of reminding audiences to stop getting snacks or going to the bathroom or talking.
- I said that was interesting.
- Or talking, she said.
- The older detective died of a heart attack.
- The younger detective shot and killed the killer.
- The female sergeant wept at the older detective's funeral as she held the hand of the younger detective.
- The killer's funeral was not shown.
- The show ended.
- She was crying.
- She unbuttoned her men's dress shirt and pulled my hand inside it.
- She said she loved that show.
- She said that she didn't know how she would get through the summer without it.
- I agreed that it was a great show, much better than I had expected.
- Thus was my honesty murdered.
