- Greetings sleepless!

- My dreams spliced together seamlessly, I might add.

- There's nothing extraordinary about what I did, of course &#8212; any normal person could pull it off &#8212; but boy, did it feel good!
- Now, I want to help you, if you'd let me.

- My first recommendation is that you turn the clock toward the wall.

- This way, you can end the torment of those molten numbers hovering in the darkness as you fail to sleep.

- I bet you could exhaust a whole night doing that.
