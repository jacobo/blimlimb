- "All:"
- First, I want you to know that I am extremely proud of our efforts in recent years to expand our earnings by keeping customers on the line for a few extra seconds during each call.
- |
  

- As we've seen on our earnings charts, a few extra seconds on every call (average of 18 calls per day per customer) multiplied by 30 million customers equals millions of dollars in pure profit every quarter.
- |
  

- In particular, I have often received praise about our Voicemail Call-Extension System (VCES).
- But this business moves quickly, and it's time to update VCES.
- |
  

- "If our customers are willing to take basic directions on how to use voicemail\x97\"Record your message after the tone,\" for instance\x97before  every single voicemail they leave , are they not also willing to stay on the line for more \"guidance\"?"
- |
  

- Forcing them to stretch further over their monthly minutes, thereby paying us more free money?
- |
  

- As our esteemed company founder once said, "If the money isn't free, we're working too hard."
- In that spirit, I have taken a hard look at our current voicemail-message transcript.
- |
  

- I offer profitable additions below.
- "TYPICAL CELL-PHONE-USER MESSAGE: \"Hi, this is ____."
- |
  

- Please leave me a message at the tone, thanks.
- "PART 1 OF CURRENT COMPANY VOICEMAIL MESSAGE THAT FOLLOWS USER MESSAGE: \"Record your message after the tone."
- "Let's remember: This portion of the message was invented by former manager Bill \"Operation Steal Customer Phones to Increase Cell-Phone Sales\" Jacobs, before he left us for Big Oil. In its time, this line was groundbreaking: By repeating basic information that has already been offered by a customer, we squeezed an extra 2.5 seconds out of the caller."
- Now, we can do better than that.
- |
  

- For instance, what is a "message," exactly? And what is "the tone"?
- |
  

- "And, nitpicking here: Whatever happened to \"please,\" which takes a precious second to utter?"
- "Here's a suggested version of our message, with new content in italics: \"Record your message after the tone,  please."
- |
  

- "A message is something you speak into the receiver to let the person you're calling know at least five things: (1) Your full name."
- |
  

- Standard information like time and date that you called, and your cell-phone number, in case they can't access this information on their cell phone.
- |
  

- The reason you are calling.
- |
  

- That you are likable and have a sense of humor, which will be communicated when you say something that makes them smile or chuckle (for suggestions on funny comments, call 1-800-[ need number here; separate memo coming on this ]).
- |
  

- That you are finished leaving the message; this is often done by saying "goodbye." And we said you are to do this "after the tone.
- "\" The tone sounds like this: ( insert tone sound ). Wait!"
- |
  

- Don't start recording your message now!
- |
  

- That wasn't THE tone, just the sample tone.
- |
  

- It will sound exactly like that tone you just heard, but that was not it.
- |
  

- We will let you know when the real tone is coming.
- |
  

- We promise.
- |
  

- First, we have a few other things we'd like to tell you.
- Go ahead and read this new message aloud.
- |
  

- Several test runs have indicated we're clocking 58 seconds of extra time.
- |
  

- And this is just Part 1 of our proposed new message.
- "PART 2 OF MESSAGE: \"To send a numeric page, press 1.\""
- I'm happy that we're still able to waste caller seconds by offering technology that went out with beepers.
- |
  

- It's further proof that no one's willing to fight our efforts to garner more free money.
- |
  

- "Alter this portion of the message to the following: \"To send a numeric page, press 1.  To send a text message, hang up and call 1-800-( need number ) to hear our text-message operating instructions."
- |
  

- "And to send a message by Morse code, press # for more options."
- "Assuming, of course, that no one will press #."
- "PART 3 OF MESSAGE: \"When you are finished recording your message, hang up."
- |
  

- For delivery options, press 9."
- We've all shared a laugh at this line in our weekly meetings.
- |
  

- "I will never admit that we all pretended to be \"mentally challenged\" customers who don't know when or how to hang up a phone!) But why are we telling them to hang up? Look at the next sentence in our message; we're doing the right thing: inviting them to stay on the line for \"delivery options\"\x97which, when accessed, introduce the customer to Operation Terminal Hold."
- "Capitalize on this with the following: \"When you are finished recording your message,  you will lose your connection if you hang up."
- |
  

- If you lose your connection, you will not have the opportunity to hear about our delivery options.
- |
  

- And what delivery options they are!
- |
  

- We can deliver a message today, or, if you decide to ignore our delivery options, your message will automatically be delivered next Tuesday.
- |
  

- "Other automatic options: fun barnyard animal sounds, quotes from Eddie Murphy's R-rated films, and  American Idol  love messages ."
- |
  

- OK, get ready, because here comes the tone.
- |
  

- While you are waiting for the tone, we'd like to offer a game of cell-phone Sudoku.
- |
  

- Good luck!
- |
  

- "By the way, the tone will sound like this: ( tone sound ). Wait!"
- |
  

- That's not it!
- |
  

- Hold, please.
- Let's implement these changes immediately.
- |
  

- "I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this has the potential to be bigger than \"Operation Directory Assistance: Give Customers Wrong Number, Forcing Them to Call Back."
- Thanks,
- |

  TYPICAL CELL-PHONE-USER MESSAGE: \"Hi, this is ____. Please leave me a message at the tone, thanks.\"\n\
  PART 1 OF CURRENT COMPANY VOICEMAIL MESSAGE THAT FOLLOWS USER MESSAGE: \"Record your message after the tone.\"\n\
  Let's remember: This portion of the message was invented by former manager Bill \"Operation Steal Customer Phones to Increase Cell-Phone Sales\" Jacobs, before he left us for Big Oil.

  Here's a suggested version of our message, with new content in italics: \"Record your message after the tone,  please. A message is something you speak into the receiver to let the person you're calling know at least five things: (1) Your full name.
