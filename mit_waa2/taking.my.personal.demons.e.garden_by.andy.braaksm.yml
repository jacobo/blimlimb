- Ahem.
- |
  

- OK, guys, can you listen up for a second?
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- Well, because it's authentic Italian cuisine for a fair price in a family environment, that's why.
- |
  

- Anyway, I wanted to tell you all why I brought you out here today.
- |
  

- No. Well, yes.
- |
  

- I mean, I brought you  here specifically  for the authentic Italian cuisine, but I brought you out in general because I want to talk to you guys about a few things.
- |
  

- What?
- |
  

- The food isn't that bad.
- |
  

- The people in the commercials seem to like it well enough.
- |
  

- Yeah, the commercials are pretty corny, but could we get off the Olive Garden for a few goddamned seconds?
- OK, great, moving on.
- |
  

- Listen, I like you guys a lot.
- |
  

- As far as personal demons go, I don't think I could do any better than the group I have now.
- |
  

- And we've had some fun times, haven't we?
- |
  

- Hey, Authority Issues, remember the time you and me and Anger-Management Problems got totally hammered at the bar and then pissed on the wall outside that store and when the cop tried to Breathalyzer me I took a swing at him?
- |
  

- That was a lot of fun.
- |
  

- I couldn't have done that without you two.
- Wait, where did Abandonment Issues go?
- |
  

- Really?
- |
  

- He just got up and walked out the door?
- |
  

- "I can't say that I'm surprised, but it seems a little bit clich\xE9, wouldn't you agree?"
- |
  

- I mean, Christ, talk about fulfilling a stereotype.
- |
  

- No, I don't think that's why he left.
- |
  

- The food here is fine.
- Anyway, like I was saying, I like you guys a lot and we've had a ton of good times, but there's a time when you have to re-evaluate the kinds of people you hang out with.
- |
  

- I've been fired from four jobs in the last two months, and I don't want to blame it entirely on you guys, but it doesn't help that I keep showing up for work hung-over.
- |
  

- Why do you think I'm looking at you, Blossoming Dependence on Alcohol?
- |
  

- "No, I don't think they overreacted\x97I'm a teacher, for Christ's sake."
- |
  

- Kids can too tell when I'm drunk.
- Could you stop flirting with the waiter for one second, Doubts About My Sexuality?
- |
  

- Thank you.
- Look, I'm just saying that I'd like a little stability in my life.
- |
  

- I can't remember the last time I've had a girlfriend for more than a week or two.
- |
  

- God bless you, Fear of Commitment, you've saved my ass a few times .
- |
  

- Yeah, the one with all the cats, she was a psycho.
- |
  

- That was a good call.
- |
  

- But still, I've probably pushed away more than my share of winners, and it's not like I'm knee-deep in the ladies.
- |
  

- Yes, I do think that's at least partly your fault, Crippling Lack of Self-Confidence.
- |
  

- I appreciate your honesty.
- "So I guess what I'm saying is that I don't think we should hang out anymore\x97Jesus Christ!"
- |
  

- I do understand how you feel, Anger-Management Problems, but breaking that wine bottle against the side of the table isn't really helping your case any.
- |
  

- Put it down.
- |
  

- Seriously, man, you're making a scene.
- |
  

- I don't want to get kicked out of here.
- |
  

- No, I don't think we could find better food out on the sidewalk.
- For the love of God, Doubts About My Sexuality, didn't I tell you to quit flirting with the fucking waiter!
- |
  

- Right, ha ha, I did say for just one second.
- |
  

- What the hell are you even doing here, anyway?
- |
  

- I thought we stopped hanging out in middle school.
- OK, I tried to put this delicately, but I really need you guys to stop calling me and just leave me alone.
- |
  

- I can do just fine without you.
- |
  

- Yes, I can.
- |
  

- You're such a dick, Crippling Lack of Self-Confidence.
- What?
- |
  

- Now is not the time for a dine-and-dash, Authority Issues.
- |
  

- Yeah, I do still want to stick it to the man, but do you think that the Olive Garden really qualifies as the man?
- |
  

- It's just some shitty chain restaurant.
- |
  

- Yeah, fine, I admit it, the Olive Garden is terrible and we shouldn't have even come here in the first place.
- Hey!
- |
  

- Could everybody settle the shit down!
- |
  

- No, I don't feel like an ass for saying "settle the shit down," Crippling Lack of Self-Confidence; it's a perfectly fine expletive. But seriously, I'm trying to talk here. Authority Issues, you're paying for your meal. I have no idea where that samurai sword came from, Anger-Management Issues, but you better put it away before they call the cops. And I swear to God, if you don't stop flirting with the goddamned waiter, I'll kill you myself, Doubts About My Sexuality.
- This is a disaster.
- |
  

- Does this shithole even have a liquor license?
- |
  

- Where the hell did My Blossoming Dependence on Alcohol go?
- |
  

- I guarantee he's got a flask on him.
- |
  

- Good Christ, I need a drink.
- |
