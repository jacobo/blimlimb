- The porn I like is sad, but not  too  sad.
- The porn I like is comical, and light-hearted, but neither clownish nor gratuitous.
- The porn I like involves women, or men, or both, or landscapes, or greenery, or clusters of moisture, or ravages of blight.
- The porn I like does not offend my good taste; rather, it challenges my mores and forces me to reaffirm what I hold true.
- |
  

- Also, the porn I like is in slow motion, and occupies time otherwise spent reading timely brusque fiction, or home-decoration magazines.
- The porn I like is expensive and rare.
- |
  

- I gladly sacrifice Friday pizzas and cable television for the porn I like.
- |
  

- I do not, however, sacrifice  Monday Night Football , nor do I sacrifice the attentive love of my family.
- The porn I like isn't rated X; it's rated AW, as in  aw yeah .
- The porn I like is scrumptious as a wedding cake frosted with icing sugar and coconut and stuffed with caramel pudding and mayonnaise and Hershey's syrup and smoked salmon, and should be smeared and drooled accordingly.
- |
  

- In the porn I like, everyone is satisfied, and educated, and wealthy, and contributes to worthy causes like Amnesty International, and sometimes the charity and the porn are suffused in a warm spiky glow that emulsifies their elements into a jellyish wash that engulfs and convinces even the sternest-hearted disbeliever.
- The porn I like isn't made in the San Fernando Valley, or Sweden.
- |
  

- It's made in the hearts of every hard-working, tax-paying, freedom-loving citizen of the Free World; also, in Quebec.
- The porn I like is subtly unrelenting.
- The porn I like is gentle, then nasty, then gentle, then utterly ghastly, then wraps me up like a burrito in its kindness and good will, and pokes me in massaging prods along my lower neckline where I am sorest from sitting at a computer all day in a $40 chair, then slaps me around and flosses my teeth, then teaches me things I never knew about this crazy species  homo sapiens  that I pretend to understand, and, finally, it gratifies me and reads me record reviews from  MOJO , the porn I like's favourite English music magazine (the porn I like being an avid fan of rare UK discs from the 60s and 70s, most fervently the work of the Yardbirds and the Kinks).
- The porn I like helps me sleep at night.
- |
  

- I sleep in uncoughing slumbers, like a loved child.
- The porn I like never ends; it's like a moon-crescent promise at the end of a fatty day; it's a dream that pinches itself awake; it's a dune that rises into a crimson moon and bleeds cool preparedness into its witnesses; it calms me with its houndlike whimpers.
- The porn I like is available to all, at any hour, at no cost, to no chagrin.
