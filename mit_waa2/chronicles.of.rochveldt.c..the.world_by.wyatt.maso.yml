  PART ONE.
  Rochveldt Caertflenk was the ugliest man in the world.
  It would be unlikely, though, that this statement, made without equivocation
  of any sort, would be deemed credible by anyone without some sort of
  corroboration. An anecdote, perhaps. That is to say: we all have seen ugly
  people. Perhaps we are ourselves ugly people. They are, after all,
  everywhere, and so it is only fair to assume that they are near, or here,
  whichever the case may be (when it is assuredly both). Ugly people
  everywhere, in the streets and between our sheets. Malformed homunculi
  listing through haute-couture emporia, searching for that slimming
  microfiber tee whose design is sure to diminish, and perhaps even render
  invisible, those unconscionable clavicles, and that hump. Poignant, such
  survivalism.
  But on to Rochveldt.
  We do not say that he is "ugly," for to make such a statement would make him
  unremarkable and it is clear that, as we have remarked upon him already, we
  mean to do just the opposite. So: Rochveldt is not ugly. He is, as
  said, The Ugliest Man in the World. One might quibble: How, in fact, in the
  world, the mighty world, the endlessly untethering coil, the blabbeddyblah
  blah, could one know this statement to be more than mere hyperbole? In these
  quantitative times, we rightly ask for proof. If only to staunch the flow of
  doubt, we say: and you shall have it!
  Then it is possible one's mind might release its viselike clench on Truth's
  slippery shadow and instead begin the process of possibility, remembering
  all the ugly men we have seen (or been) and thus piece together a personal
  composite that would approach the state of ugliness's ideal . My, we think,
  how very ugly. How terribly, gruesomely ugly. And yet: how strongly we can
  assure you that such composites, drawn by the police sketch artist of the
  soul, do not begin to approach the abject horror that is Rochveldt,
  Rochveldt Caertflenk.
  We reconsider. We had been thinking the greasy thin hair, the pug nose, the
  scabby, scarred cheeks, the receding gums. No, no, not that way at all. The
  wrong road altogether. So: we now think of the subway, that clearinghouse of
  ugly. We think of a particular man who had moved so slowly, shuffling along
  in our periphery. Could this be Rochveldt? We think of the shock that had
  accompanied our first full sight of this fellow: how his face had been
  scarred to an odd molten state (we imagine the heat, the flame); how his jaw
  had been surgically removed (we imagine the force of the blow, atomizing
  cartilage and bone); how a hollow was all there was where there should have
  been a nose (we ponder frostbite or gangrene, and the adventures that
  accompany touristy trauma); how, in short, it seemed as though his face was
  less a face than a memory of such, or a face assembled by one who'd never
  seen a human and had done their best with what they had to go on, as in a
  bad science fiction television programme. But the man in the subway had been
  real, his deformity real and his pain real and our pain at seeing such
  misfortune real. And as horrible as his appearance was, its purity, that is
  to say its inarguability, was without question a thing that approached
  grandeur, or, if you're feeling fancy, Grace. For all those who had seen him
  were overwhelmed by horror, to be sure, but suddenly thereafter by a
  stronger sense of pity, Pieta. And while pity is an ignoble emotion, is the
  Ethel Merman of emotions in a room full of Callases, it is an emotion
  nonetheless, that evidences a clear stirring of the soul, however shallow,
  prompting a concomitant sense of sorrow, however fleeting. We feel,
  terribly, for that sort of man in general and that specific man, too. His
  ugliness prompts dialogue in strangers such as, That Poor Man, Whatever
  Could Have Happened To Him? as well as much shaking of heads and statements
  such as It Really Puts Things In Perspective, Doesn't It? or Here I Was
  Worrying About My Thinning Hair And Here Comes That Poor Guy.... It is an
  Oprah sort of ugly, a celebrity ugly, a movie of the week ugly, a rich and
  famous ugly, complete with lissome blonde weeping wife by his old malformed
  side ugly. An ugly that sells. An ugly that zings. And that is not our
  Rochveldt. No, no.
  When we speak of ugliness, the ugliness that is Rochveldt, Rochveldt
  Caertflenk, The Ugliest Man in the World, we mean to make indelible that the
  only reaction one can possible have to his visage and form is not pity, but
  pure, unmitigated disgust: disgust over being subjected to something,
  some thing, clearly human and yet clearly not so. For Rochveldt's is an ugly that
  elicits no tears, no tenderness, no coddling warmth from the bosom of
  strangers and puppies. It is an evil sort of ugly, an ugliness shriller
  still than the whole of the off-key world, an ugliness that screams Expunge!
  The ugliness of Christmas Past, Present, and Future rolled into one
  terrible, ugly, now.
  Here: let me begin to tell you of Rochveldt, and of his immutable ugliness.
  END PART ONE.
