- Hello, and welcome to TheStreet.

- I'm your new host, Neil Cavuto.
- |
  

- "Our first topic tonight is the question everyone's asking: Cisco."
- |
  

- How low can it go?

- For an answer, we go to James Cramer of theStreet.

- James?

- "CUT TO: James Cramer, being wrestled into the studio by three burly guards."
- |
  

- JAMES CRAMER
- No! No, I won't offer my patented brand of hyperactive market criticism!
- |
  

- I will not share with you the unique insights I've gained as a high-flying money manager!
- |
  

- A thousand times, no!
- |
  

- One of the guards hits Cramer with a belt, and he drops out of view.
- |
  

- There is a long, uncomfortable moment where the only thing visible onscreen is an empty chair and the sound of offscreen scuffling.

- Then the camera cuts, mercifully, back to Cavuto.

- "CUT TO: Cramer, with a conspicuous welt on his forehead."
- |
  

- CAVUTO
- Jesus!
- |
  

- What happened to you?
- CRAMER
- Um, nothing.
- |
  

- I fell.
- CAVUTO
- Ah.
- |
  

- "So, the whisper numbers: Do they rule the Street, James?"
- CRAMER
- Sure.
- |
  

- Yeah.
- |
  

- Whatever.
- |
  

- A gloved hand enters the frame and smacks Cramer.
- |
  

- Cramer intones flatly:)
- I mean, oh, they absolutely do.
- |
  

- It's insane.
- |
  

- Insane, I tell you.

- Biotech stocks swooned today in the face of renewed threats of governement interference.

- |
  

- "CUT TO: A man with a burlap sack over his head."
- |
  

- A hand reaches in from out of the frame and hastily removes the sack to reveal an unshaven and haggard Cramer, blinking in the harsh television lights.
- |
  

- CRAMER
- Wha.
- |
  

- CAVUTO
- So, what do you make of today's news, James?
- CRAMER
- What news?

- His microphone abruptly goes dead.
- |
  

- Cramer, oblivious, continues talking, becoming increasingly agitated.
- |
  

- He begins to gesticulate, pointing agitatedly at his forehead several times and making a gesture that looks uncannily like a man wielding a cattle prod.
- |
  

- The camera CUTS abruptly back to Cavuto.
- |
  

- CAVUTO
- Thanks, James!
- |
  

- Always good to have you on the show!

- As investors continue to flee high-tech stocks for the safety of blue chips, which are the ones you should be buying?
- |
  

- For an answer, we go to James Cramer of theStreet.
- |
  

- But first, Jim, I believe you had something you wanted to say.
- CRAMER
- |
  

- Thanks, Neil.
- |
  

- I'll get to your question in a minute.
- |
  

- But before we do that, I'd like to apologize to you &#151; and to the good people of Fox &#151; for my behavior lately.
- |
  

- It was wrong for me to withhold my witticisms and penetrating insight from your audience.
- |
  

- I now see that yours is the one true way.
- |
  

- Please don't hurt me anymore for I love you.
- |
  

- I am all love for you.
- |
  

- Please don't get the stick.
- CAVUTO
- We love you too, James.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- Now dance, monkey, dance!

- What?
- CAVUTO
- You heard me.
- |
  

- CRAMER stands and shuffles his feet slowly.
- |
  

- CAVUTO
- Faster!
- |
  

- CRAMER dances faster.
- |
  

- CAVUTO
- Faster!
- |
  

- Faster!
- |
  

- Dance like you mean it!
- |
  

- CRAMER dances as fast as he can.
- |
  

- CAVUTO begins to clap his hands to provide a beat.
- |
  

- The cameramen and other off-camera personnel join in.
- |
  

- Tears stream down CRAMER's face as he dances.
- |
  

- It is unbearably poignant.
- |
  

- This piece does not have a proper ending.
