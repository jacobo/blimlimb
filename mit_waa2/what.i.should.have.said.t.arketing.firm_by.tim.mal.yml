- "\"Hi, is Tim there?"
- "\"Hi, this is Tim."
- "\"Hi, Tim."
- |
  

- It's Annie
- "\"Oh."
- |
  

- Hi, Annie.
- "\"Tim, I thought you were coming in to work today."
- "\"Yeah, sorry about that, I meant to call you but I lost your phone number."
- |
  

- I've decided that I don't want to work for you because I'm not comfortable with your sales techniques.
- "\"Wh."
- |
  

- How do you mean?
- |
  

- What techniques?
- "\"Well, the way the script is written, it makes it seem as if they've already ordered the product."
- "\"Yes, but if they ask, we tell them that they haven't ordered anything."
- |
  

- We don't lie to them.
- "\"But that's only if they ask, and some people won't think to ask."
- "\"What do you mean?"
- |
  

- Of course they ask!
- "\"Look, the sales technique that you are using is a variation on what's called 'an assumed sale."
- |
  

- It's a very successful technique and many different telemarketing companies and other sales people use it.
- |
  

- It's also extremely coercive.
- "\"You begin contact with the target by speaking in a manner that implies that you're talking with them about a product that they've already ordered."
- |
  

- While it's true that if they ask whether or not they've actually ordered anything you're obliged to admit they haven't, this is not why the technique works.
- "\"The key is that by the time they get around to asking you this question, you've already disarmed them."
- |
  

- They still have their first impression that they're talking about something they already ordered.
- "\"This is, of course, the opposite of the actual situation."
- |
  

- What's actually happening is that you're asking them to commit to something new.
- |
  

- All things being equal, when you ask someone to make a commitment they will probably say 'no.
- |
  

- By switching things around, you've made it so that all things aren't equal.
- |
  

- Saying 'no' now seems to entail backing out of a commitment.
- "\"Never mind that when they do ask you if they ordered the product, you're supposed to respond, 'No, ma'am/sir, you didn't order the product."
- |
  

- This is in regards to your medical and dental records.
- |
  

- Now, as I was saying.
- |
  

- Tell me honestly, Annie, does that sound like a straightforward answer to you?
- |
  

- It sounds to me like you've deflected the question, implying now that this is in some way related to their health.
- "\"You also have a second innovation that I'd never heard about before."
- |
  

- You acquire the names and information of people who have previously bought stuff from telemarketers.
- "\"So you narrow your targets down to people who have shown a willingness in the past to buy things over the phone."
- |
  

- Plus it gives the whole call much more of a 'confirming past decision' feel.
- |
  

- Where a normal sales call would involve asking for their address, etc.
- |
  

- The targets never even have to divulge their credit card numbers, avoiding what is often a make-or-break step in the sales process.
- |
  

- This sales call instead has the target confirm information that the company already has.
- |
  

- The target feels he's done business with you before.
- "\"During my job interview you suggested that a great way to guarantee that they agree to having the product sent to them is to ask a question that they'll easily answer with a \""
- |
  

- "\" right before asking if it is okay to send them the package."
- |
  

- A question such as, 'And I did confirm your address, didn't I?' If you've already secured someone's agreement to something, they're much more likely to agree a second time.
- "\"Finally Annie, when I applied to work for your company, I answered an ad for work as a pollster, promising that there was no sales involved."
- |
  

- So if I can't trust your company to accurately advertise for employees, how on earth do you expect me to trust you that this isn't all a big scam?
- "\"I mean, a bigger scam than I've already discovered it to be."
- "\"Annie?"
