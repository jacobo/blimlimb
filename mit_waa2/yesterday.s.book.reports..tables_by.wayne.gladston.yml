- Alice in Wonderland
- MATT McCONAUGHEY, OCTOBER 14, 1985
- Alice in Wonderland  is about this girl's trippy adventures in a far-out place called "Wonderland.
- "\" There are all these weird dudes running around."
- |
  

- Like there's this freaky Cheshire cat and even a caterpillar smoking a hookah.
- |
  

- No, really.
- |
  

- A hookah.
- |
  

- That's in the movie.
- |
  

- I mean, the book.
- |
  

- I read the book.
- My favorite part is where Alice sees some cake that has a sign that says "Eat me.
- "\" \""
- Eat me!
- "\" The sign says \""
- Eat me.
- "\" Seriously."
- After Alice goes on a few more "trips," she meets this total buzz-kill queen who's, like, all about harshing everyone's mellow. She sucks. If I were Alice, I'd tell the queen to smoke some of that caterpillar's hookah.
- Anyway, then she wakes up and everything's over.
- |
  

- The book was pretty cool, but I don't think it's cool that this Lewis Carroll ripped off Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit.
- "\" I mean, not cool at all, y'know?"
- |
  

- That song has a caterpillar and a queen in it, too.
- |
  

- And it rocks.
- The Jungle
- RALPH NADER, DECEMBER 2, 1951
- The Jungle  by Upton Sinclair details corporate America's abuses in the meat-packing industry.
- |
  

- The book, published in 1906, caused a major uproar and led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act that same year.
- |
  

- At one point in the book, a factory worker falls into a meat grinder, but the plant processes the meat anyway.
- |
  

- Supposedly, that doesn't happen anymore, but I still think Sinclair was a failure.
- |
  

- The Pure Food and Drug Act doesn't do nearly enough.
- |
  

- And it seems corporate America has only gotten worse.
- Sinclair also ran for Congress unsuccessfully a few times.
- |
  

- If he really wanted to make a difference, he should have run for president.
- |
  

- He still would have lost, but hopefully he could have frustrated the campaign of a good and qualified man, thereby saddling this stupid country with a horrible president to punish apathetic Americans for their indifference.
- |
  

- Anyway, someone should do that.
- A Separate Peace
- MATT DAMON, FEBRUARY 8, 1986
- I really related to this book.
- |
  

- "It's about two best friends who go to a respected New England school: an earnest, responsible student named Gene and a carefree, inexplicably successful student named Finny."
- |
  

- Even though it didn't make any sense to me that a guy like Finny could go to a respected New England school, I still liked this book.
- |
  

- Especially the part where Gene pushes Finny out of a tree and Finny breaks his leg.
- Finny is too busy having fun to notice that there's evil in the world.
- |
  

- He doesn't even believe Gene when Gene confesses to pushing Finny out of the tree on purpose.
- |
  

- That actually works out great, because Finny runs away and breaks his leg again.
- |
  

- But this time marrow enters his bloodstream and kills him.
- |
  

- I think this means that people who are too lazy and irresponsible to know what's going on deserve to die, even if they're your friend.
- |
  

- And that people who study hard and go to good schools will be successful even if they're friends with an idiot they wish were dead.
- The Trial
- CHRIS HANSEN, OCTOBER 12, 1982
- This book by Franz Kafka is about a man, Joseph K., who is ultimately executed for some crime.
- |
  

- We never learn what that crime is, and the book starts with the author telling us that Joseph K. was arrested because someone was "spreading rumors" about him.
- Still, people don't come looking for you unless you've done something wrong, right?
- |
  

- I think Franz Kafka never tells the reader what Joseph K. did because the book was published in 1925 and you probably couldn't talk about sex crimes back then.
- |
  

- I mean, it seems pretty obvious that Joseph K. was propositioning teens for sex.
- |
  

- Why else would he be held up to ridicule in front of his landlady, family, and employer without the benefit of any kind of legal representation?
- At one point in the book, Joseph K. speaks out against the system that sits in judgment of him.
- |
  

- But that's precisely how you know he's guilty.
- |
  

- I liked this book a lot.
- |
  

- It made me feel good because I'm not Joseph K.
