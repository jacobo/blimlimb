- Age 5.
- On my first day at school, a girl was having trouble opening a small packet of ketchup during little lunch.
- |
  

- She asked me if I would help her open it.
- |
  

- Though small for my age, I was tough and tore it with my teeth.
- |
  

- I tore it good.
- With the remaining shreds of plastic in my mouth, I spat it at the boy sitting next to me.
- |
  

- All the children laughed, including myself, but he was not happy about it.
- |
  

- He informed a teacher who later informed my father.
- |
  

- My father told me to stop spitting at other children and that spitting was no good.
- As he told me this, I was already thinking of ways to hurt that kid for being such a sook.
- |
  

- Age 6.
- I scared the daughter of a family friend by chasing her with a book opened to a giant close-up photo of a tarantula.
- |
  

- While she ran, she kept looking back to see how far away I was.
- |
  

- By doing this, she could not see what was in front of her.
- |
  

- As a result, she ran into a tree trunk and was knocked senseless.
- When her parents found her lying on the grass, unconscious, they carried her into the house while my mother had a stern word with me.
- |
  

- I argued my case but she remained unconvinced by my theory that all girls were uncoordinated.
- |
  

- Age 7.
- I stole one dollar from my mother's purse to buy some Spiderman/Hulk bubblegum that came with tattoos.
- |
  

- I bought three.
- |
  

- As soon as I got them, I threw the bubblegum away and unfolded the wrappers to see which tattoos I got.
- |
  

- They were all of the Hulk.
- |
  

- It was incredible because I didn't want the Hulk.
- |
  

- I wanted the Spiderman tattoo.
- I wet my right arm with some spit and placed the tattoo over my biceps.
- |
  

- My mother walked past as I was waiting for the transfer to take.
- |
  

- She asked me what I was doing.
- |
  

- I told her nonchalantly that I was getting a tattoo.
- |
  

- I was a man so it was no big deal.
- |
  

- Then she asked me where I got the money from to buy the tattoo.
- |
  

- That was a little more difficult to answer since I did not have a job nor was I given any pocket money.
- After much interrogation, she finally made me cough up the truth and for my honesty, I received a spanking.
- |
  

- What's more, the tattoos didn't work, so by the day's end, I was sporting a red patch on my bottom and a green blob on my arm.
- |
  

- Age 8.
- I locked my younger brother in the storeroom for three hours with the lights off.
- |
  

- Outside, I taunted him with stories that the Spam monster was going to get him.
- |
  

- The Spam monster was a blobby old thing that liked to eat small children, smothering them in its digestive jelly.
- |
  

- I told my brother that Spam is so salty because the smothered children cry so much before being completely devoured.
- It was a story that made my brother cry.
- |
  

- He banged his small fists against the door until he got tired.
- |
  

- He sobbed wearily, but after a while, he got inspired again and banged on the door some more.
- I finally let him out when I heard my parents open the front door.
- |
  

- I tried to hurry him out, but the light momentarily blinded him as tears and snot ran down his face.
- |
  

- I tried to calm him down by telling him that everything was all right, that the worst was over.
- |
  

- Although he was grateful for being released, he went ahead and told my parents what happened anyway.
- Later that evening, as he was getting ready for bed, I told him the Spam monster hates little sooks.
- |
  

- I told him, furthermore, that he should always count his toes in the morning, just in case the Spam monster ate a couple while he slept.
- |
  

- Age 9.
- Once I spent the night at a friend's house.
- |
  

- We were gathered around the table for dinner and as we sat there eating, my friend's older sister came to the table.
- |
  

- She was wearing a fleecy tracksuit.
- |
  

- As she sat down, I pulled the chair from underneath her.
- |
  

- Her rear end dropped like an anvil, and she landed with a thwack on the tile floor.
- |
  

- The way down she had a puzzled look on her face.
- |
  

- Sprawled on the floor in her tracksuit, she looked as if she had just finished break-dancing.
- Everyone at the table stopped eating and stared.
- I waited for her to laugh and tell me what a funny trickster I was, but instead she started to cry.
- |
  

- Between sobs she swore at me, before scampering off to her bedroom.
- |
  

- After she was gone, the family stared at me.
- |
  

- I waited for them to burst into laughter and tell me what a funny trickster I was, but none of them did.
- |
  

- Not even my friend.
- The house was quiet.
- |
  

- They continued to stare.
- |
  

- I thought, it was supposed to be a joke, people.
- |
  

- Age 10.
- During lunch, I played the poaching game with some friends on the school playground.
- |
  

- It was like cops and robbers except instead of cops, we had poachers and instead of robbers, we had animals.
- |
  

- You got to choose which animal you wanted to be.
- |
  

- Most of my friends wanted to be lions or cheetahs.
- |
  

- The cheetah was the most popular.
- On this occasion, I was an impala.
- |
  

- I thought it complimented my quick but graceful running technique.
- |
  

- When I ran from the poachers, I leapt into the air every now and then, confusing but also amazing the poachers.
- |
  

- Because I was such a prized spectacle, everyone wanted to take me down.
- |
  

- Well, I got caught eventually, and as the poachers pinned me to the grass, I looked at the persons responsible for my capture and said, "Fuck you.
- "\" It was something I picked up from Rambo."
- A teacher nearby heard everything, walked over and asked me what I'd just said.
- |
  

- I repeated it, and she told me to stand at the flagpole for the remainder of lunch.
- |
  

- In response, I sneered at her and walked to the flagpole with my hands in my pockets.
- |
  

- Age 11.
- I was popular with the girls in my grade and decided to take five of them to the big Year Six Farewell Party.
- |
  

- The girls didn't know about the arrangement.
- |
  

- I calculated that if I told them I was already taking other girls with me, they wouldn't want to go with me.
- When the girls found out the truth at the party, they became quite angry.
- |
  

- They banded together and told me I was mean and good for nothing.
- |
  

- Then they threw the flowers I had bought them in my face.
- |
  

- One of the roses got stuck in my hair because I had so much gel in it.
