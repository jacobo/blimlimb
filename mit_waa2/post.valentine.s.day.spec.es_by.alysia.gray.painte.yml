  NAME: Indiana ("Indy" "Hoosier Honey")
  OCCUPATION: State
  BIRTHDAY: December 11th, 18???
  BIRD: Cardinal
  FLOWER: Peony
  A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF: Well, after entering the union as the 19th 
  state, I had a lot of success with factory-driven commerce and agriculture.  
  I guess I started seeing Oregon a little bit after this, it wasn't yet a 
  state, younger than me and all that, not that I go in for that necessarily.  
  Then Oregon became a state, maybe around 1859?  I never heard from the busy 
  Beaver State again.  My good friend Calif&#151; well, let's just say a good 
  friend, spotted Oregon under Washington one night and practically every day 
  since.  That hurt a lot.  A LOT.
  YOUR IDEAL PARTNER: A strong state, older than my last fling, not so brash.  
  Illinois maybe?  We've been neighbors for a long time.  "Nois" knows my whole 
  past and hasn't run yet.  Chicago is a good kid, too, loud but loves his 
  parent.
