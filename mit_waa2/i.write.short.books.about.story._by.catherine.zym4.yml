  June 2, 2000
  I've started doing this upsetting what-would-Jesus-do thing.
  But instead of Jesus, it's Ricky.  Yesterday, for example,
  while rooting through a bin of $2.99 underwear at Filene's
  Basement, digging deeper and deeper for a pair that wasn't
  the color normally reserved for highlighter pens or hunting
  caps, I stopped and considered my environs.  Would Ricky
  ever rifle through a box of reject underwear, desperately
  searching for Armani briefs (I hear he wears only Armani),
  symbolically showing the bargain basement shoppers, nay the
  world, the shrouded essence of his inner being?
  Of course he wouldn't.  Most likely, Ricky has someone on
  staff just to handle his foundation
  requirements.  Possibly, he orders from a catalog, late at
  night, as a way to unwind after a big show.  Or, perhaps,
  Ricky enjoys shaking his bon-bon sans wrapping.
  And that's my point.  That I even considered this little
  dreamscape, that I rested elbow-deep in synthetically
  fibered panties thinking about Ricky Martin, shows just how
  victimized I am by the constructs of my own obsession.
  This must have been what Joseph Mitchell felt as he immersed
  himself, teabag-like, into the lives of his subjects --
  Professor Seagull, Captain Charley, Mr. Hunter -- until he
  mixed with them so completely, the writing process became a
  collaborative effort.  Which explains how he could remember
  banks of dialogue, islands of quotations, without ever using
  a notepad or tape recorder.  He was Heathcliff!
  It wasn't this way with the Backstreet Boys.  With so many
  of them, my attentions were divided, diluted.  I had even
  taken to burlesquing their names -- the Bossy One, the Cute
  One, the Serious One -- and so on.
  There was, of course, Brian Littrell. The Heart Murmur One. I wrote the
  following:
  It was Brian's devotion to his family and faith in God that
  helped in through an illness that almost ended in tragedy.
  Born with an undiagnosed murmur and hole in his heart, Brian
  was a energetic child who never had trouble keeping up with
  his older brother Harold.  But at five, he fell off his Big
  Wheel bike, which started an infection that spread through
  his blood.  The family didn't know it at the time, but a few
  weeks later, when Brian slipped and hit his head, doctors at
  the hospital told the Littrell's that Brian had a deadly
  infection.
  Brian stayed in the hospital for two months.  His doctors
  believed that he had no chance of surviving and told his
  parents to start making funeral arrangements.  His mother
  prayed for her son to get better.  Pretty soon the infection
  started to clear up and before long, Brian was perfectly
  healthy.  Brian and his family thanked God for what could
  only be a miracle.  Said Brian, "I think that's why God gave
  me this gift to sing.  So I can bless other people's lives."
  As I wrote, their appellations became even more apposite in
  my mind, until at last, the Boys ceased to be Boys, just
  afflictions.
  The urge to typecast was irresistible, but it prevented me
  from getting at the men behind the cute labels. The
  Backstreet Boys: Doin' It Their Way received middling
  reviews in VOYA (Voice of Youth Advocates) magazine.
  "Backstreet Boys provides biographies for each of the five
  band members," writes Beth Karpas.  "Zymet describes the formation of
  the group,
  their original gigs at small venues, and their superstardom
  overseas before they achieved recognition at home in the
  United States. The last two chapters
  cover personal and professional challenges that the band has
  faced in the last two years.  Unlike the Affleck title (Ben
  Affleck: I Make My Own Rules, by Sam Wellman), schooling is
  never mentioned, unusual considering that two band members
  were under sixteen years old when the band began.  Also,
  Zymet's book is a bit too short to fulfill the
  one-hundred-page limit for book reports."
  Is it any wonder that I worry how critics will receive Ricky
  Martin: His Crazy Vida?  Why else would I have mentioned his
  math and U.S. Studies tutors in my second chapter, "Ricky:
  The Menudo Years?"  And why else would I have ordered so
  many Ricky Martin biographies (for research) that my
  personal Amazon recommendations now skew to include Harry
  Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Eloise's Guide to Life,
  and William Gaddis' A Frolic of His Own?
  And then there are the nightmares. . .
