- "It's what you've always suspected: that thing, that no two fingerprints are alike, it isn't true."

- I can't vouch for the snowflake corollary, but let's go out on a limb and say that isn't true either.

- Brings up an interesting question, though, right?
- |
  

- Where'd we get those fingerprints in the first place?
- |
  

- Funny we should ask.
- Recall, if you will, your second-grade criminology lab.
- |
  

- "The one where you went around swabbing cheeks, making balsa-wood mockups of the scene, presenting your samples in an egg carton, fingering the foreign kid for the drop\x97Tuan usually, or at least a minority."

- Of course, yes, the case of Will West was the lesson there, and fingerprints the victor.
- Will West was arrested in 1903 for a crime he said he didn't commit.

- I love that, when they claim innocence.
- |
  

- "But someone identified him as the perp, and when he was at the gates of Leavenworth they did a full forensic workup, measuring his ear, foot, head, and nose shapes\x97it was called \"Bertillonage,\" and it was  the  way to identify criminals\x97and they said, \"Oh yeah, it's Will West."
- |
  

- Matches perfectly.
- |
  

- We've already got him on record.
- "\" That was the whole point of Bertillon's ID system: you get the measurements and file them and then you can track criminal records."
- |
  

- It was dead-on certain, a perfect way to ID a guy.
- Except.
- |
  

- "The Leavenworth guard\x97hunkered down spreading West's toes with calipers\x97checked his list twice: \"Boss, uh, says here Will West is already  in  prison!"
- "\" A silent pause passed between the two men, silence overfilled with dismay."
- |
  

- No, that's dumb.
- |
  

- There wasn't dismay.
- |
  

- Just silence.
- |
  

- But then boss man ripped the sheet from the guard's hand and screamed, "
- Damn it, McDermott!
- |
  

- Whaddya mean!
- |
  

- Then who is  this  guy?
- |
  

- "\"Sir, there must be two Will Wests!"
- And there were, these two guys who looked pretty damn identical.
- "\"Our sure-fire ID technique is insufficient!"
- |
  

- It can't differentiate!
- |
  

- We need something better!
- |
  

- Exclamations!
- |
  

- What'll we do?
- |
  

- The portly boss said nothing; instead, he scratched his Irish beard while daydreaming of cracking skulls with his weatherworn nightstick, so fustigated was he.
- |
  

- "Out of the shadows stepped a dashing, pipe-smoking, tweed-wearing, early-century David Caruso: \"One word, gentleman."
- |
  

- Are you listening?
- |
  

- "Well, one compound word: fingerprints."
- They thus promptly inked the two Will Wests' fingers and, huzzah, the patterns differed.
- |
  

- Right there, that very day, the warden tells us, fingerprints came in as the new sure-fire technique for unique scientific identification.
- Talk about progress.
- |
  

- Because, time was, our French friend Bertillon seriously had the best thing going.
- |
  

- I wasn't kidding.
- |
  

- His system used 16 different ear-shape descriptors, a range of head-pointiness statistics, six ways to define a beard, and other peculiar bodily measurements.
- |
  

- Foot length, foot width, foot depth, foot angle, toe spread, toe length, toe-jam capacity .
- |
  

- It was a complete anthropometric package.
- |
  

- "Yet it only worked for so long, because eventually\x97shocker\x97beard gruffness wasn't that good at predicting criminal behavior or at making perfect, one-to-one matches when your suspect was in custody."
- |
  

- And maybe, just maybe, two different Will Wests could have similar toe configurations.
- |
  

- "We needed something better: fingerprints stepped up to the plate, real rational like."
- |
  

- And they lasted a while in the top spot till "DNA fingerprints" took over, back in the quaint '80s.
- So we go from criminology prehistory to Bertillon's anthropometrics to fingerprints to DNA, each time as confident as the last.
- |
  

- Fact is, you get yourself a good theory, work with it for a long while, and then just let it float.
- |
  

- Plus, with an average urban sample population, these methods still mostly work anyhow.
- |
  

- You don't need Court TV, with their fingerprint logo no less, to vouch for that.
- |
  

- As this one guy, Cole, said, by sheer "dint of analogy, lack of contradiction and relentless repetition," these bits of folk wisdom become "deeply enshrined.
- "\" We get a real aura of infallibility."
- "Speaking of fallibility, I should say, too: Your second-grade teacher's Will West story?"
- |
  

- The Leavenworth warden made that up like 15 years after the fact.
- |
  

- I mean, maybe the two Will Wests were legit, but he didn't switch on a dime to fingerprints right then.
- |
  

- Else, how come he'd not even learned of them until 1904, the year after?
- Anyhow.
- |
  

- "The network sent me next season's pilot for  Coast Guard CSI: Norfolk , asking for notes, and oh, I gave them notes."
- |
  

- But I never heard back.
- |
  

- Surely they didn't want to hear that forensic certainty is an artifact of the present.
- |
  

- Give us some time and we'll again call it progress that we realized we didn't know so much as we thought we knew.
- |
  

- Just a hunch.
- |
  

- Plus, I think a maturing Soleil Moon Frye, even with her plausible escape from the typecast of Punky Brewster, is simply miscast.

- It's not time yet.
