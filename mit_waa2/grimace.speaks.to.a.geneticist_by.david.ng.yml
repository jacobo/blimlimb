  GRIMACE: What am I?\n\
  GENETICIST: That is a very interesting question indeed. And we should begin by briefly discussing your known history. According to your records, you were born as \"Evil Grimace,\" with four deft arms, and a penchant for amusing yourself by stealing milkshakes from small children. Then, in 1974, you experienced a change of heart, a loss of two arms, and a metamorphosis into what is your current incarnation\x97a supposedly warm, gentle, and seemingly living representation of the \"embodiment of childhood.\"\n\
  GRIMACE: Is that why I have only one orifice?\n\
  GENETICIST: Perhaps so, as childhood is a period marked by the most basic of bodily functions. In truth, it is that kind of interesting nuance that makes me suspect your being a genetically modified organism. Furthermore, the timing of your appearance coincides perfectly with a social phenomenon during the '70s. A time when discussing human cloning was culturally fashionable, when books like  The Boys From Brazil  and  In His Image  appeared on bestseller lists.\n\
  Also, you are purple like a giant areola.\n\
  GRIMACE: How can I find out more?\n\
  GENETICIST: A promising course of action is to try genetic counseling. Which, in the conventional sense, suggests that we investigate your network, both in family and in friendship. This is to help construct a more complete picture of your being and, more importantly, your past. From this, we will have a firm starting point from which to build.\n\
  GRIMACE: But I have no family, no real friends, and Ronald, frankly, scares me. What other alternatives do I have?\n\
