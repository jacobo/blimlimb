- In the spirit of cultural diplomacy, Eric Clapton has been invited to perform a concert in North Korea in 2009.
- Wonderful Tonight
- It's late on another glorious evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.
- She puts on just a modest amount of makeup, and brushes her unpretentiously short black hair.
- And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?
- "And I say, \"Yes, you look wonderful\x97but not wonderful in a seductive way\x97tonight."
- Tears in Heaven
- Would you know my name
- If I saw you in some socialist paradise in the afterlife?
- Would it be the same
- Again, if I saw you in some socialist paradise in the afterlife?
- Layla
- Layla, you've got me off my knees.
- Layla, I'm not begging, there's no such thing as begging here, only  juche , darling, please.
- Layla darling, no need to ease my perfectly content and never-worried mind.
- Cocaine
- If you got bad news (which does not exist), you wanna kick them blues (ditto).
- Unlike Americans, don't do cocaine.
- When your day is done and you wanna stay.

- Go home.
- No Korean has ever tried cocaine.
- Pretending
- Working on the glorious sound of the band,
- Getting the music perfectly right.
- Two go out proudly working long hours.
- No one needs to stay home at night.
- That's when she said she was not pretending.
- Of course, she knows the plan.
- That's when I knew she was not pretending.
- Pretending not to understand.

- What is there not to understand?

- Bad Love
- Oh what a feeling I get when I'm at a state rally.
- It takes my heart into everything I do,
- And it makes me sad for the lonely people like Americans.
- I walked that road for so long.
- Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people.
- My love for country is making me strong.
- I've never had bad love.
- Kim Jong Il is someone I can be proud of.
- I've never had bad love.
- "No more\x97no such thing\x97bad love."
- It's in the Way That You Use It
- I've never seen dark skies, never in this country.
- Walked on some thick and sturdy ice, never like this.
- I've never told you white lies.

- What are those?
- |
  

- Looked into true eyes, never like this.
- It's in the way that you use it.
- It comes and it never goes.
- |
  

- Nothing does.
- |
  

- It's in the way that you use it,
- Boy (and girl), don't you know.
- Before You Accuse Me
- Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
- Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.
- You say I've been spending my money on nuclear weapons.
- You've been taking money from someone else.
