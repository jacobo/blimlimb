  When you get an e-mail from someone you know and it
  wasn't meant to go to you, remain calm. Read it if you
  have to, but never, ever, let on to the sender that
  you have read it.
  Are you going, you read, to Icky Susan's stupid
  birthday dinner? Fortunately, you are not Susan;
  unfortunately, you are her friend. You have never
  before heard any of your supposedly mutual friends
  refer to her as "Icky Susan." Consider the list of
  people who were sent this message: you know some of
  the names, but not all of them. Does this mean that
  Icky Susan is known to be icky among a large circle of
  people, or that some of them, like you, were sent the
  message by mistake?
  Copy the text without looking at it and paste it into
  Word; then (and only then) Reply to Sender thus: This
  seems to have been sent to me by mistake. Don't worry,
  I've deleted it. All best, [Your name here]. Send the
  message and watch it being sent: the bar will fill up
  quickly or slowly depending on the speed of your modem
  and the time of day. Regret sending it for a moment,
  but do not exacerbate the situation by sending a
  second message that says By the way&#151;I didn't read it.
  Decide that that must be implicit.
  Look at the message again. Look for Susan's name
  among the recipients and be glad you don't find it.
  Imagine how terrible she would feel if she saw this
  message. Realize that you have always known, deep
  down, that the sender doesn't like your friend Susan
  but only pretends to for your sake. Try to forget you
  have read it; try not to imagine the ways that you,
  too, now that you think of it (Don't!), find the
  hapless Susan icky.
  Log off from your Internet Service Provider because
  you need a rest from e-mail, but don't shut down your
  actual e-mail program in case you want to quickly type
  a quick message to one of your many friends and
  acquaintances, some of whom you would not be in touch
  with had they not handed you their business card at
  the last college reunion, the one where everyone
  suddenly had business cards with e-mail addresses on
  them. Take a deep breath. Go make yourself a cup of
  herbal tea.
  Go back to your desk. Move the mouse so the fish stop
  swimming on your screen. Look at your new untitled
  document containing the mis-sent e-mail. Consider
  again how lovely it would be to work at home, not in a
  cubicle. (You've got a much better choice of tea at
  home.) Get back on-line and e-mail your friends this
  consideration, but try to phrase it more cleverly:
  type in I wish I could work at home... but it occurs to
  me that "home office" is an oxymoron. Send the
  message; then send another one to the same people
  saying: Not that he's not a nice guy. Get off-line
  again. Everyone is probably at lunch, anyway. Make
  yourself a cup of real tea because this one has gotten
  cold. Do not berate yourself for the wasted teabag, or
  the loss of hot water. Do not think of the
  luxuriousness of your idle life, that you can waste
  tea, water and heat in this way, not to mention the
  milk. Do not think of the milk.
  Think about Susan and why someone might find her
  icky. There's the way she chews with her mouth open,
  there's the way she can draw out a cup of coffee for
  over an hour, taking tiny sips and holding you hostage
  to her beverage consumption while you think, I
  finished my coffee ages ago, what is your problem? The
  last time you saw Susan you met at a place that,
  unfortunately, had a millennium clock ticking down the
  seconds on the wall behind her, and so you could time
  her coffee exactly: 67 minutes.
  But you knew this about her, which is why you never
  eat lunch with her anymore&#151;it takes four hours&#151;and you
  knew, too, that for Susan this is a vicious circle:
  she is lonely, so she eats and drinks slowly on social
  occasions, which makes people not want to eat with
  her, which makes her more lonely. Resolve to bring a
  nice big bunch of daisies to her birthday party.
  Realize, with a shock, that though you knew it was her
  birthday next week, you have not yet received an
  invitation to her party, by e-mail, voicemail, fax or
  phone or answering machine, or even by old fashioned
  paper snail mail. Think: That bitch. Resist the
  temptation to "accidentally" forward the mis-sent
  message to the (in the end) Icky Susan. Consider
  yourself virtuous.
  Go into Word. Open your new document. Save it as
