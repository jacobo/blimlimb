- Over 100 high-level officials appointed by the Bush administration now oversee industries they previously represented as lobbyists, lawyers, or company advocates.
- |
  

- Many of those appointees have pushed for more favorable policies for their respective industries from within the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department, and other agencies.
- |
  

- Six have been the subject of ethics investigations or have resigned due to conflicts of interest.
- The Bush-appointed chief counsel for the FDA, Daniel E. Troy, is a former lobbyist for pharmaceutical firms.
- |
  

- Last December, he met with several hundred pharmaceutical attorneys and offered them the government's help in dismissing lawsuits against their companies.
- |
  

- By then, Troy had already officially intervened on behalf of Pfizer in several cases.
- |
  

- A 2002 General Accounting Office study of the FDA's new system for notifying companies of rule violations, implemented by Troy, concluded that warning notices "have taken so long that misleading advertisements may have completed their broadcast life cycle before FDA issued the letters.
- In 2001, Ann-Marie Lynch, who had lobbied against price controls on prescription drugs on behalf of a trade group, was made the deputy assistant secretary in the office of policy within the Department of Health and Human Services; she has since discouraged the administration from adopting price caps.
- |
  

- A report issued by Lynch helped persuade Congress to ban Medicare from negotiating for lower drug prices.
- |
  

- She has also blocked the release of about a dozen research reports that challenged the claims of drug companies.
- Charles Lambert, a former meat-industry lobbyist, became a deputy undersecretary in the United States Department of Agriculture in December 2002.
- |
  

- As a USDA official, he has argued that mad cow disease is not a threat to the U.S.
- |
  

- Six months after he told Congress that the disease would not reach America, it was discovered in a cow brought here from Canada.
- |
  

- More than a dozen other USDA officials also have connections to the meat industry.
- Jeffrey Holmstead worked as a lawyer at Latham & Watkins representing a chemical company and a trade group for utility companies until October 2001, when he was appointed to the EPA.
- |
  

- The agency's proposed changes to air-pollution rules, released January 30, included at least a dozen paragraphs taken from a proposal submitted to the Bush administration by Latham & Watkins in 2003.
- |
  

- Those rule changes will allow many plants to continue to avoid emissions reductions.
- In June 2001, Bush chose J. Steven Griles, an energy-industry lobbyist, to be the Interior Department's second-highest official.
- |
  

- An investigation by the department's inspector general concluded that Griles's appointment had created an "ethical quagmire.
- "\" A former Griles client has been awarded $2 million in no-bid contracts, and he has pressed the EPA to allow gas drilling by several companies he once represented."

- More than 100,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the war, according to a study prepared by American and Iraqi scientists.
- |
  

- Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad designed and conducted the household survey that was used to gather data.
- |
  

- The authors attributed the vast majority of deaths to coalition air strikes, and wrote that "most individuals reportedly killed by coalition forces were women and children.
- "\" Other nongovernmental estimates of civilian casualties in Iraq range from 10,000 to 30,000."

- In March 2001, President Bush's EPA announced that it would withdraw a new standard for arsenic in drinking water and reinstate an outdated standard established in 1942.
- |
  

- The lower standard cuts costs significantly for the mining industry and water suppliers.
- "The new standard\x9710 parts per billion (ppb)\x97was implemented by the Clinton administration after a decade of testing and studies."
- |
  

- One of those studies authorized by Congress cost $2.
- |
  

- Another report, by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1999, concluded that the previous 50 ppb standard could "easily" result in a 1-in-100 cancer risk and recommended that acceptable levels be lowered "as promptly as possible.
- "When the president made the decision to go back to the original 50 ppb standard, he said: \"At the very last minute, my predecessor made a decision, and we pulled back his decision so that we can make a decision based upon sound science and what's realistic."
- "\" His EPA administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, said the standard had not been based on the \""
- |
  

- In October 2001, following a new NAS study concluding that the 10 ppb standard was scientifically justified and possibly not low enough, the EPA finally adopted that standard.
- |
  

- But by this time it was widely recognized that a 3 ppb standard (the lowest level that EPA studies consider technically and economically feasible to achieve) would best safeguard consumers.
- |
  

- In fact, studies now show that the 10 ppb standard presents cancer risks 10 times higher than the level EPA considers acceptable in regulating other water contaminants.

- Because some counties in China allow coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization, the administration explained, it could not send UNFPA aid to the country.

- The decision was made despite the fact that no evidence has ever been found to connect the UNFPA's work with such coercive practices.

- President Bush, who officially endorsed the ban, took no action to move it through Congress.

- A study by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence found a 66 percent drop in use of assault weapons in crimes after the ban was first enacted in 1994, prohibiting the sale of 19 types of semiautomatic weapons.

- A report by the Consumer Federation of America on the expiration of the ban concluded that "assault weapons will be more lethal and less expensive.
- A poll by the National Annenberg Election Survey found that 68 percent of Americans wanted the ban extended.

- But Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said last week, "I think the will of the American people is consistent with letting it expire, so it will expire.
- "\" At least 2,000 sheriffs, police chiefs, law enforcement groups, and prosecutors also endorsed the ban and asked the president to extend it."

- However, in a last-minute change to the bill, the tax break was denied to families who earn just above minimum wage.
