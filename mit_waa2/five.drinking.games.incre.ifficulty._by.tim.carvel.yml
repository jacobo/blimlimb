  Three: Inside the Actor's Studio
  Drink whenever...
  ...an acting student asks a question that turns out to be more of a
  statement.
  ...an actor discusses an early, demeaning job with a great show of good-humored, self-effacing embarrassment.
  ...series host James Lipton praises a guest so fulsomely that you yourself,
  sitting at home in your underpants with your bottle of bourbon, feel
  uncomfortable.
  ...during the show-ending questionnaire, an actor is asked his or her
  favorite swear word, and they smirk and say one, and it's bleeped out, and
  it gets a huge laugh, as if no one's ever seen this happen before, as if the
  mere utterance of a swear word is very funny.

  Four: Life
  Drink whenever...
  ...you are offered a drink.
  ...you are in a bar.
  ...you are watching a televised sporting event.
  ...you are with friends.

  ...you are feeling especially happy.

  Five: Short-form humor pieces
  Drink whenever...
  ...the technique of repetition is used for a laff.
  ...a joke is made of a second-tier television personality.
  ...the conceit of the piece becomes woefully apparent.
  ...the conceit of the piece quickly wears thin.
  ...the conceit of the piece is run into the ground.
