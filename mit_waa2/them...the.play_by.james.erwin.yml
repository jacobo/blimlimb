  DRAMATIS PERSONAE
  Private #1
  Private #2
  Private #3
  General
  ( The stage lights come up to reveal the  GENERAL  before a bank of computer monitors, flanked by  PRIVATE #2  and  PRIVATE #3 .  PRIVATE #2  anxiously peruses a long printout. )
  PRIVATE #2: Something's gone wrong! These results are off the chart!
  GENERAL: Heavens above! What's happened?
  PRIVATE #2: I can't tell! I need more data!
  (PRIVATE #1  rushes on from stage left. )
  PRIVATE #1: Giant ants are destroying the town square!
  GENERAL: Great Scott! This is our punishment for tampering with forces we do not understand!
  PRIVATE #1: Actually, sir, I would disagree.

  GENERAL: Induction be damned! We must destroy the giant ants before they destroy us! Muster the men and call the 144th Bomber Wing for immediate air support!
  PRIVATE #2: I'm sorry, sir, but in all conscience I can't acquiesce in the destruction of these giant ants. We lack any sort of proof that the giant ants intend to destroy us.

Separating the ants from their environment and thinking of an atomistic "solution" to them without considering the ideological and ontological framework within which we conceive of a "giant ant" is counterproductive. Sure, the ants may be killed. But even in that case, have we really done anything to address the underlying problems of phallocentric militarism and scientific arrogance that created the giant ants? As a matter of fact, let's examine the etymology of the word "solution"&#8212;the word comes from the Latin "solutionem," a "loosening or dissolving." The demand for a "solution" unconsciously and immediately moves us into a verbal act of destruction and disempowerment! For that matter, the very word "science" is descended through the Latin word "sciens"&#8212;"to know"&#8212;from the Indo-European root word for "cutting." I propose that to even attempt a rational discussion of a problem, and to move along the hoary dialectic timeline from "problem" to "solution," is to re-enact history's egregious act of rape, the ancient tragedy of the Mesopotamian priest-despots: the cutting of lines into the world! I suggest that agriculture, which delineates the earth, and science, which would delineate the universe beneath its scalpel, leaving indelible cicatrices in our minds and our realities, do nothing but lead us further and further from the world as it is, and leave us stranded instead in a vicious circle in which signs signify signs, in which nothing can be known but our lonely and ever-darkening solipsistic nightmare.

The unspeakable wonder of belonging to a world, and not of observing it. Do not seek to solve the ants. You strive in futility. Rather, give up seeking and striving altogether. Simply ... be.
