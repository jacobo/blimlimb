- Perhaps you'd had too much wine.

- Or perhaps you are against foreign investment, although I happen to think the Chinese are saving our asses.
- "At any rate, you'd clearly lost your senses\x97not to mention you were scaring the children\x97which is why I had no choice but to remove you from the premises."
- |
  

- Being the sole vote, I approved the government bailout, packed the kids into the car, and headed to Wal-Mart.
- This is where things get tricky, depending on whom you choose to believe (Warren, who was with me the entire time) and who has a vibrant imagination (Brittany, who was left in the car as a lookout).
- |
  

- In any government bailout, it's the working class that gets stuck with the bill, which is why it made symbolic sense to stick it to the store employees.
- |
  

- I did not steal anything, as Brittany suggests; I simply borrowed 40 Monopoly boards (ask Warren) so I could teach my children a valuable financial lesson.
- I'm hoping this note sheds some light on my economic acumen, and that you'll consider coming down to the jail to discuss this face to face.
- |
  

- After all, Pamela, we have a game to finish.
- |
  

- And I do believe it's your roll, sweetheart.
