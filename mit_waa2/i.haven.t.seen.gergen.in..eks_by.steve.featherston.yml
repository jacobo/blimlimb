  Me and David Gergen have this pact.  Whenever something was weighing on
  one
  of us, we'd call up the other and take our guns and pop off some rounds
  until we felt better.  We did this at the bottom of a ravine near my
  house,
  shooting at old appliances people had dumped there over the years.
  This one time though Gergen didn't call first.  I was downstairs,
  reloading
  empty 12-gauge shells when Gergen comes in through the basement door.  I
  
  didn't hear him.  Sometimes we messed around in the woods, pretending to
  be
  government agents or Navy SEALs, sneaking up from behind to slice one
  another's throats.  Well, Gergen does this while I'm pouring powder into
  the
  shells, putting his hand on my jaw and twisting my neck as if to snap
  it.
  Powder went everywhere.
  "I could've killed you," Gergen said.  I noticed he was wearing those
  new
  tiger-stripe fatigues we were looking at the other day at DeJulio's
  Army/Navy.  I said I was going to get a pair, and Gergen laughed and
  said
  they were knock-offs made in China, not the real thing -- but here was
  Gergen, standing there grinning in the same tiger-stripe fatigues.  On
  the
  floor next to him was a long black plastic case with shiny chrome
  clasps.
  "Shit's expensive, asshole," I said, scraping powder off the bench with
  a
  piece of cardboard.   I nodded toward the case and asked Gergen what was
  in
  it.
  He grinned again and said, "Let's find out."
  Something was bothering Gergen.  I asked him if his wife was busting his
  ass
  again about the truck payments, but he just shook his head and knelt
  down to
  unlock the case.  I pushed some shells into the magazine of my 12-guage
  and
  leaned it against a tree.  While I was checking the action on my Glock,
  Gergen gently lifted from the padded case what at first looked like a
