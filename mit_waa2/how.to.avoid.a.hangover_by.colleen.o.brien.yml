- Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.
- |
  

- Pop a few vitamin B. A complex will do, straight B-12 is best.
- |
  

- Bread is your comrade.
- |
  

- Preemptive ibuprofen never hurts.
- |
  

- PMS medication, especially the prescription stuff, is better.
- |
  

- Think of your brain as a muscle.
- |
  

- Enough booze and it aches.
- |
  

- A pill that relieves cramping, a kick-in-the-pants muscle relaxant, works wonders.
- |
  

- Consider trying to change your lifestyle, again.
- |
  

- Get off work and notice the deer grazing on the hillside, the crocuses poking through the dirt, a magpie hopping around the dumpster.
- |
  

- Stay in tonight.
- |
  

- Read a self-help book.
- |
  

- Paint a landscape.
- |
  

- Knit a hat.
- |
  

- Except, self-help books make you caustic.
- |
  

- Your paintings look like a nearsighted third grader did them.
- |
  

- You don't knit.
- |
  

- You're too young to be home alone.
- |
  

- It's Friday.
- |
  

- The quiet hurts your head.
- Call a friend, say you'll meet her there.
- |
  

- At least eat something.
- |
  

- Anything.
- |
  

- Heavy and starchy would be best.
- |
  

- But you don't feel hungry.
- |
  

- You can't remember the last time you were hungry, not really.
- |
  

- Take care with your clothes, hair, makeup.
- |
  

- Choose Levi's and a t-shirt, a braid, lip gloss.
- |
  

- Looking natural isn't easy.
- At the bar, order a Pepsi.
- |
  

- People do it everyday.
- |
  

- You're funny and smart and you don't need alcohol to have a good time.
- |
  

- You nod at the server and say, oatmeal stout.
- Drink it slowly.
- |
  

- Sip it.
- |
  

- Have a glass of water.
- |
  

- Laugh at the story your friend tells about asking her boyfriend to buy a box of Tampax on his way home.
- |
  

- Ha!
- |
  

- She says he's more likely to chew off his own toe.
- |
  

- Commiserate with her about men, what cowards they can be, such poor communicators, thinking one thing&#151;saying another.

- |
  

- Request a pint of amber.
- |
  

- Smile at the man in the Carhartt jacket.
- |
  

- Comment to your friend about the proliferation of working-class posers.
- |
  

- To play at what you are not is the highest form of disrespect, the lowest form of condescension.
- Your friend is leaving, going home to her waiting,  bit-of-cotton-phobic boyfriend.
- |
  

- Wish her luck.
- When the man in the jacket offers to buy you a drink, tell him no thanks, you can't stay.
- |
  

- Ask him how he keeps his steel-toed boots looking so new, his fingernails so clean, his hands so smooth.
- |
  

- Instead, you say, bourbon.
- |
  

- You don't have to talk to him.
- |
  

- You owe him nothing.
- |
  

- But that would be impolite.
- He is not good-looking, not especially bad-looking either.
- |
  

- He's nice, slightly awkward, a bit shy at first.
- |
  

- You try to set him at ease.
- |
  

- Ask what he does, how long he's lived here.
- |
  

- He says he doesn't have a job.
- |
  

- He says he doesn't have to work.
- |
  

- His father cornered the baby carrot market years ago.
- |
  

- You don't laugh.
- |
  

- Your mother taught you to be charitable.
- |
  

- He's proud and earnest and confident in a way only the wealthy are.
- |
  

- You inquire about the potential for other garden-fresh foods finding a niche in the mini-vegetable arena.
- |
  

- He looks at you like you suggested winter last another month.
- |
  

- There's nothing, he says, like a baby carrot.
- He talks about the food pyramid, about vitamins and fiber, trophic levels and energy.
- |
  

- He asks if you've read "The Celestine Prophecy.
- "\" You are bored."
- |
  

- But you are not home, and alone, and bored.
- |
  

- Make an effort to appear amused.
- |
  

- Pepper your sentences with words like lutefisk, kolache, and Worcestershire sauce, for no better reason than you like the feel of them rolling off your tongue.
- |
  

- He teaches you the international gesture for choking; one  hand around his neck, the other palm raised flat like he's signaling someone to stop.
- He offers you a cigarette.
- |
  

- You don't smoke, quit years ago.
- |
  

- He lights it for you with his monogrammed Zippo and orders another round.
- |
  

- He tells you he snow boards, rock climbs, fly fishes.
- |
  

- Your father taught you that what a man does matters more than what he says he does.
- |
  

- You feel the guy's smoky breath in your ear.
- |
  

- He's telling you your eyes are lovely, mesmerizing, beautiful.
- |
  

- For a moment, you let yourself feel flattered.
- |
  

- For a moment, you believe him, and you are gorgeous and he is kind and good and everything you've ever dreamed of, and the world spins joyful on a pixie-stick axis.
- Go to the bathroom.
- |
  

- Tell yourself to pack it in, walk back to your apartment.
- |
  

- Call it an evening, now.
- |
  

- In the morning, when you pick up your car, you will reflect fondly on the nice time you had.
- Study your reflection in the worn, spotty mirror above the sink.
- |
  

- Imagine yourself years from now, living high on the hog off baby carrot money.
- |
  

- A ring, a house, a garden.
- |
  

- Stop yourself before you start naming the toddlers you see in the picket-fenced yard.
- |
  

- This is not healthy.
- |
  

- This will never happen.
- |
  

- But if it did you would speak to your twins only in pig-Latin.
- |
  

- Immersion.
- |
  

- They would be bilingual before they turned two.
- |
  

- Paint the shuttered two-story purple and green with junipers out front where you will hide the Easter eggs&#151;toss them gently so they catch in the branches.
- Your eyes look red, not pretty.
- |
  

- One more.
- He speaks French.
- |
  

- Uses words like insipid, existential, melancholy.
- |
  

- He tells you about a road trip to Banff, says he'd like to take you there someday.
- |
  

- He talks about getting away, cutting out, hitting the open road.
- |
  

- You hum a little Springsteen.
- |
  

- There's a lot you can run from but you never leave yourself behind.
- |
  

- You tell him you don't speak Canadian, eh.
- |
  

- He does not laugh.
- |
  

- You are still bored.
- He talks about the biology of rarity.
- |
  

- You say Darwin.
- |
  

- You say yellow and blue make green.
- |
  

- Only the fit survive.
- |
  

- Leave yourself behind.
- |
  

- He lights your cigarette.
- |
  

- When he signals the bartender tell him, nothing for me, thanks.
- |
  

- You say, Long Island Iced Tea.
- |
  

- He drives a Range Rover with a bumper sticker that says "Boulder is Better.
- "\" A \""
- Climb Now, Work Later" decal hangs in the back window.
- |
  

- His vanity plate is "RECRE 8."
- You say spit on the sidewalk looks like money in the moonlight.
- |
  

- You are drunk.
- |
  

- You have trouble with the seat belt.
- |
  

- He helps you, kisses your forehead, mashes his wet lips against it.
- |
  

- He stops at Safeway.
- |
  

- You wait in the car, rub his saliva away with your sleeve.
- |
  

- He comes back carrying a six-pack of your favorite beer.
- |
  

- You wonder if he bought condoms.
- |
  

- When he shifts into third, he rests his hand on your thigh.
- |
  

- You feel nervous, queasy, like the earth is rotating on a Tilt-a-Whirl, and you've had too many  Indian tacos.
- When you get to his house, play with the dog.
- |
  

- When he hands you a bottle of beer, ask him for aspirin, a glass of water, fruit juice, anything but this.
- |
  

- You say, thank you.
- |
  

- He asks you how many feminists it takes to change a light bulb and before you can answer, he says, just one dammit and it's not funny.
- |
  

- He laughs like he's the next Seinfeld.
- |
  

- You're tired.
- |
  

- You imagine you're with the next Seinfeld.
- |
  

- You imagine a fictional life based on actual occurrences but funnier and better-written.
- When he kisses you, you kiss him back without meaning to.
- |
  

- Tell him you should be getting home.
- |
  

- He says you can have the bed.
- |
  

- This would be a good time to bolt, make like a baby and head out, get, while the getting's good.
- |
  

- You climb under the covers with your clothes on.
- When he crawls in beside you, you say no.
- |
  

- His hands are under your shirt, all over you.
- |
  

- You say you don't do this.
- |
  

- You say you support the idea of casual sex, wholeheartedly.
- |
  

- Let's hear it for Casual Sex!
- |
  

- But you've never mastered the behavior.
- |
  

- You, you tell him, are not that kind of girl.
- |
  

- He tells you it's okay, as he pushes down your jeans.
- |
  

- He says he doesn't do this either.
- You give him what he wants before he takes it.
- |
  

- Chivalry, you tell yourself, is when the guy buys the condoms.
- |
  

- And it's not funny.
- |
  

- You know you usually find what you're looking for, even if you lie to yourself about what that is.
- Concentrate on remembering the Pythagorean theorem, A squared plus B squared equals, inevitably, C squared.
- |
  

- Sing Counting Crows lyrics softly in your head.
- |
  

- You can never be lonely.
- |
  

- You pretend you're in that fictional world with the next Seinfeld.
- |
  

- There should be a term for this mouth-breathing trustifarian.
- |
  

- A Yiddish term, you imagine&#151;Yiddish, the condiment language&#151;a schlemiel but more complex, a schlemiel with chutzpah perpetrating a faux pas.
- |
  

- But that's French.
- |
  

- And you search the reaches of your brain.
- |
  

- You remember that woman in "When Harry Met Sally," one of the old ladies, married forever, from the how-we-met vignettes. "At that moment I knew," she says, "I knew the way you know about a good melon." But how  do  you know about a good melon?
- |
  

- You obviously missed that critical moment in your upbringing when a kind aunt or a fast cousin tipped their hand and tried to clue you in, divulge the secret of choosing melons.
- |
  

- You were probably too busy watching "Man from U.N.
- C.
- L.
- E.
- "\" reruns."
- |
  

- You watched way too much television.
- |
  

- Your pig-Latin-speaking children will only watch "
- ER.
- "\" One hour a week."
- |
  

- And then it's over.
- He snores.
- |
  

- You hate him.
- |
  

- You wish you could hate him more.
- |
  

- But then you don't hate him at all.
- |
  

- You can run but you never leave yourself behind, not really.
- |
  

- And you think up names for twins, On-ray and Miss Chief, and places to hide Easter eggs, the tips of mittens, toes of socks, the china hutch and Tampax box.
- |
  

- They'd never find them there.
- |
  

- You sleep.
- |
  

- In the morning, wake up before he does.
- |
  

- You hurt all over, every joint, your muscles, and especially, your brain.
- |
  

- Give his sleeping body the international sign for choking, pat the dog's head, leave.
- |
  

- Know you never have to feel this bad again, this ashamed, this ugly&#151;not ever.
- Once outside, inhale the smell of damp earth until you can taste it.
- |
  

- Notice the light, pink on the mountain tops like a well-dyed egg.
- |
  

- Make yourself whistle the whole way home.
- |
