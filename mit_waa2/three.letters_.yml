- Maybe some people wouldn't consider "Campbell" a first name, save the actor/director Campbell Scott. Now, say actor/director Campbell Scott walked into the Avenue Restaurant and Boulangerie, sat at a table by the window, ordered the chef/owner Scott Campbell's signature Trilogy of Salmon ($9.95), and had lovely lunch. As he pays the check, actor/director Campbell Scott asks to give his compliments to the chef. When chef/owner Scott Campbell locks eyes with actor/director Campbell Scott, what would happen? Additionally, how would the result be effected if the song "Rhinestone Cowboy" was playing on the jukebox, and the movie "Patton" was projected onto a back wall?

- "Hear ye, hear ye, Americans: Profanity is a privilege -- abuse it and it will disappear."
- Profanity tickles me.

- One taboo word in polite company induces seizures and delirium tremens.

- Four sounds spat forth with or without context.

- "Try this: Tell someone who might be offended by the word pussy that the Russians have a similar word that is much more offensive, and that you'll be using it so as not to offend non-Russians: pizda (peez-DAH)."
- |
  

- Say pizda all the time.
- |
  

- "Sing it: \"Piz-DA MA-niac, MA-ni-ac, I'm sure/And she's dancing like she never danced before."
- |
  

- "\" Impress high-ranking superiors at work with your knowledge that the nominative plural is pyozdy (PYOZ-dy)."

- "Declaim it: \""
- Friends, Romans, Pyozdymen!
- |
  

- Lend me your smears!
- "\" People will know that pizda is much more offensive than pussy, but will not react accordingly."
- |
  

- That's bizarre.
- |
  

- They will simply blush and write you off as a linguistic crank, which is what you have become.
- |
  

- Meanwhile, with every utterance of pizda, some poor soul in Nizhnii dies just a little bit on the inside.
- |
  

- Someone should whisper pussy to him.
- Other words acquire taboo because they are phonological cousins of bad words.
- |
  

- Let's face it, human speech organs are quite limiting.
- |
  

- Until we formally accept underarm hand-flapping and knuckle-cracking into the realm of linguistic phenomena, we're pretty much restricted in the President's English to permutations of twenty consonants, five vowels, and sometimes "y" (not, it goes without saying, including routine consonant palatalization and our predictable vowel reduction). Enter the new profanity.
- The desiccated sticks of fear, awkwardness, and phonological monotony wound together by the bright yellow twist-tie of lexical naivete yield the faggot of New Profanity.
- |
  

- Take this whole niggardly business.
- |
  

- If people were more niggardly in their use of pussy (if you follow me) and less pussy in their use of niggardly, the problem would be solved.
- |
  

- Pussy would be offensive again and niggardly would be a 500-year old English word meaning stingy.
- |
  

- The New York Times recently printed a phrase something like "Due to IMF tightfistedness.
- |
  

- "\" thus bypassing the unfortunate niggardliness."
- |
  

- This in turn offended a class of God-fearing Americans who engage regularly in deviant sexual practices.
- |
  

- Crayola is changing the name of its "

- |
  

- Meanwhile, the hue is named after scarlet clay found in India.
- |
  

- "\"Indian red\""
- |
  

- "\"Pussy red\""
- |
  

- I can make such statements.
- |
  

- My word carries great moral authority.

- I am Lev Tolstoy.
- "Whether or not the name \"Bullets for Pussy\" is a succinct plot-summary of some modern Iliad does not concern me. Polemical acuity notwithstanding, everyone here is overlooking the one obvious solution: Russian has four prepositions covered by your \"for\": Asking the band leader to translate his group's moniker into Russian would solve the problem posed by Mr. Vaughn and so brilliantly argued by Mr. Roston."
- |
  

- And a powerful barrage of whatever offensive fucking words you have left should teach the leader of the band not to cheapen and abase your God-fearing American profanity.

  Dear McSweeney's,
  Going through the daily deluge of hand-bound press releases

  Avenue Restaurant & Boulangerie on the Upper West Side (which, btw,
  boasts a Vermont Walnut Tartlet with Vermont Maple Ice Cream ($5.95) and
  strongly recommends reservations) is owned by a man named Scott
  Campbell, who also is the executive chef.
  Maybe some people wouldn't consider "Campbell" a first name, save the
  actor/director Campbell Scott. Now, say actor/director Campbell Scott

  Profanity tickles me. One taboo word in polite company induces seizures
