- First off, I'd just like to thank the City Council for giving me this opportunity to speak to you all today.
- |
  

- "I'll do my best to keep my comments brief and let you get back to the J\xE4ger ice luge, which I understand is beginning to melt out back."
- "Neighbors, friends, elected representatives\x97I am Margaritaville."
- |
  

- My father was a simple shrimp-boat captain who set course for a sleepy fishing village almost 40 years ago.
- |
  

- He didn't want much.
- |
  

- A little plot of land, some skanks, maybe a flask of rum to warm his swollen belly.
- |
  

- I'm not sure a little boy was in the plans, but he raised me with love and, more importantly, a love of this land.
- From the crisp scent of vomit-soaked pizza boxes baking in the sunrise on East Sound Pier, to the pink-and-orange sunsets softly shimmering behind the West Railyard prostitute encampments, I love every inch of this town.
- |
  

- I took my first body shot right around the time I spoke my first word, and that word was "body shot.
- And yet I fear that our children might not grow up in the same Margaritaville we've been able to enjoy.
- |
  

- A Margaritaville where you can get shithoused on a quiet jetty and think about what it would be like to get a dolphin high.
- |
  

- A Margaritaville where you can take a dump on a snow-white sand dune and swear at a baby pelican.
- |
  

- A Margaritaville where college dropouts, irrespective of race or creed, can listen to Pink Floyd and dry-hump below a rainbow.
- |
  

- These are the experiences I cherish, and I know that I am not alone.
- Now, I realize what I'm about to say might not make me the most popular man in town, but I just want to pose a simple question to you all.
- |
  

- Which human organ parties the hardest?
- |
  

- A lot of you might say the genitals.
- |
  

- Others, the face area.
- |
  

- But I would argue that the hardiest party in the human body is in our hearts.
- |
  

- And I'm asking you to use your hearts in securing a brighter future for our town.
- "As many of you know, tonight the City Council will consider a measure to rezone the old Margaritaville Condom Factory District from PZ-1 (party zone\x97industrial) to MU-GCD (multiuse, greenspace conservation)."
- |
  

- "I know that a lot of you have laughed at this proposition, but I wanted to clear up a few misconceptions about what this development would actually mean for this town:"
- "Myth:  The new zoning designation will make it harder to party."
- "Fact:  Higher population densities and smarter growth means smarter and more robust partying."
- |
  

- Imagine living in a place where you can eat, sleep, funnel beers, get treated for herpes, and attend a funeral, all without leaving a four-block area.
- |
  

- "This is the kind of mixed-use development we are planning to create at the Condom Factory Lofts\x99."
- "Myth:  Preplanned Party Zone developments such as the Condom Factory Lofts create a homogenized party atmosphere antithetical to the eclectic spirit upon which Margaritaville was founded."
- "Fact:  As part of our sustainable-development initiatives, 15 percent of all housing units in the new Condom Factory Lofts will be dedicated to affordable residences for displaced condom-factory squatters."
- |
  

- As I've said before, this development is about building up the Margaritaville community, not tearing it down.
- |
  

- If anything, our new work/play retail center promises to invite an even more diverse assortment of Margaritaville residents to stroll casually among its funky modern pornography boutiques and redesigned, Pan-Asian-inspired opium dens.
- "Myth:  Talking about environmentalism is crushing my meth high."
- "Fact:  Both Chief Seattle and Thoreau were huge meth heads."
- "Myth:  My parents never loved me."
- "Fact:  They just didn't know you, bro."
- |
  

- Come on, I'll buy you a Smirnoff Ice.
- In conclusion, we are stewards of one of the most beautiful party zones on the planet.
- |
  

- We have a responsibility to make sure every generation has a chance to party here.
- |
  

- Vote yes tonight and protect the party for yourself, for your children, and for your children's children.
- |
  

- Thank you.
