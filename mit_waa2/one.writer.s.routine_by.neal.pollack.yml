- "Note: Neal Pollack will be appearing in Denver at 10 PM this Friday, at the open-mike at the Mercury Cafe, 2119 California Street."
- |
  

- To take nothing away from the other fine open-mike readers at the Mercury, we consider this booking an insult.
- |
  

- A writer of Neal's stature should not be pigeonholed into a 10-minute slot.
- |
  

- But the oppressive, nearly-fascist governments of Denver and Boulder have prohibited local bars, bookstores, and coffeehouses from hosting a Neal Pollack reading, by special civic decree.
- |
  

- It is obvious they fear his ideas and do not understand his unique vision.
- |
  

- Well, let us show them up.
- |
  

- We strongly encourage you to come to the Mercury, with homemade signs, in the manner of professional sports fans.
- |
  

- We even more strongly encourage you to use your imagination, but no Bill Walton references.
- |
  

- "A couple of suggestions:"
- Neal 3:16
- Neal Brings Chaos
- After his brutishly short amount of time at the microphone, Neal will sign books in the back of the bar.
- |
  

- Not his own book, mind you, which is due sometime around Labor Day, but whatever book you want to bring for him to sign.
- |
  

- His friend Bill will draw cartoons in selected books as well.
- |
  

- Come to the Mercury on Friday, people.
- |
  

- Show the cowardly city councils of Denver and Boulder that you are not afraid.
- |
  

- We will win this thing.
- |
  

- Together, we will break down the walls.
- |
  

- "Now, finally, let us proceed with:"
- O N E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W R I T E R ' S  R O U T I N E .
- BY  NEAL POLLACK
- |
  

- It is evening here, and with the waning wispy light come sounds.
- |
  

- The forest brims with the hoots and rustles of creatures beyond imagining, invisible mammals of the night and their avian sidekicks, unwitting beneficiaries of my successful anti-highway development campaigns in this secluded county.
- |
  

- Across the bay, where the fish leap and trickle in the lushness of my forced overstock, a final purply blaze sparkles atop Mount Winchester, whose peak is still covered by the spring's last desperate snow.
- I admire the remnants of my goat-cheese-and-porcini ravioli, and feel both serene with knowledge and anxious in anticipation of Roger's magnificent braised rabbit loin, which he always serves with a huckleberry coulis and herbed balsamic polenta cake.
- |
  

- As always, between courses, I begin to write.
- |
  

- For write I must, as dictated by a cruel God, a crueler agent, and my public, cruelest, and yet kindest, of all.
- It was not always so.
- |
  

- In those spry days before I became this prizewinning rustic, this dotard, this paragon of arcadian selfhood, my life was unencumbered by schedule.
- |
  

- I could write a chapter in an hour and still have time for Coltrane over dinner, the actual, physical Coltrane, who wrote Giant Steps for me, his favorite thing.
- |
  

- Then came the years with drugs, and Vietnam, and my bitter public divorce, followed by a close bid for the Maryland governor's mansion.
- |
  

- But now I find myself here, by the mountains, and the water, and the ancient woods.
- |
  

- I have settled, at last, into routine.
- These preceding five-odd years were productive ones.
- |
  

- I wrote three novels, a history of the Middle East, and a volume of jokes about professional baseball.
- |
  

- I had experienced periods of equal fecundity in the past, but never with such focus, or with such a gifted cook at my behest.
- |
  

- I owe all to my special regimen, which I will now share with you in the spirit of writing well.
- |
  

- The days do vary slightly; at times I dine with luminaries brighter than the sexual potentates listed here.
- |
  

- "Nonetheless, as my dear friend Burroughs once said: Never quit."
- |
  

- Never stop writing.
- |
  

- And never lend money to a federal agent -- but that is advice for another day.
- |

  It is evening here, and with the waning wispy light come sounds. The
