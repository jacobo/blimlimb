- Writing for Nonreaders in the Postprint Era
- "M-W-F: 11:00 a.m."
- |
  

- "Instructor: Robert Lanham"
- Course Description
- As print takes its place alongside smoke signals, cuneiform, and hollering, there has emerged a new literary age, one in which writers no longer need to feel encumbered by the paper cuts, reading, and excessive use of words traditionally associated with the writing trade.
- |
  

- Writing for Nonreaders in the Postprint Era focuses on the creation of short-form prose that is not intended to be reproduced on pulp fibers.
- Instant messaging.
- |
  

- Twittering.
- |
  

- Facebook updates.
- |
  

- These 21st-century literary genres are defining a new " Lost  Generation" of minimalists who would much rather watch  Lost  on their iPhones than toil over long-winded articles and short stories. Students will acquire the tools needed to make their tweets glimmer with a complete lack of forethought, their Facebook updates ring with self-importance, and their blog entries shimmer with literary pithiness. All without the restraints of writing in complete sentences. w00t! w00t! Throughout the course, a further paring down of the Hemingway/Stein school of minimalism will be emphasized, limiting the superfluous use of nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, conjunctions, gerunds, and other literary pitfalls.
