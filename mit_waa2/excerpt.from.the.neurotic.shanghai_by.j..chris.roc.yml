  Chapter 18:
  Restrooms Outside
  Baggage Claim at Pudong International Airport (Men)
  You're almost to Shanghai! Before you leave the airport, however, we recommend you use the restrooms located immediately outside the baggage-claim area on your right for carousels 5 through 8.
  Having followed our tips in Chapter 15, you used the onboard facilities as sparingly as possible (no such thing as timely turbulence) and are most likely ready for a break.
  Regardless of current necessity, it is a long taxi ride into town, an average of 58 minutes. Mechanical failure or collision, both of which are not uncommon, could cause further delay.
  The men's restrooms outside the baggage-claim area are cleaned every two hours starting at 1 a.m., a procedure that lasts approximately 10 minutes. The best times to visit the restrooms, therefore, are 1:11 a.m., 3:11 a.m., 5:11 a.m., etc., throughout the day. Using the facilities at 12:59 a.m., 2:59 a.m., 4:59 a.m., etc., is not advised.
  If you require a restroom at the time of cleaning, use the following phrase: "Qing ni xian zai zou. Wo jue de fei chang bu hao." (Please leave now. I am not feeling well.)
  As you will notice on entering the restroom, there is no door. For urination we therefore recommend using the urinals at the opposite end of the bathroom from the entrance. These are located sufficiently far from the door to cut off the sightline from outside and preclude any mid-urination observation from passersby.
