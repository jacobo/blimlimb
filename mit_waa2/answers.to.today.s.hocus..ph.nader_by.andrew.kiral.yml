- Coffeepot is moved.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- America wants to know.
- |
  

- The people deserve answers.
- |
  

- Window is narrower.
- |
  

- It's a silent tragedy you won't see on the corporate media monopoly's evening "news.
- |
  

- Boy's shoes are smaller.
- |
  

- What aren't smaller are the mercilessly long hours, extraordinarily low wages, physical abuse, and other appalling human-rights violations that take place in the Indonesian sweatshop where these shoes were made.
- |
  

- Kitchen table is missing a leg.
- |
  

- But what do you expect with an administration that's so brazenly in bed with the kitchen-table lobby?
- |
  

- Who's going to mandate safe, wobbleproof kitchen tables with four legs when the foxes are watching the henhouse?
- |
  

- "Wall mirror is taller\x97thus containing more potential bad luck that will be unleashed on the hardworking men and women of America upon the mirror's eventual breakage."
- |
  

- "If the wall mirror were outfitted with safety bumpers\x97a proposal of mine disingenuously decried as \"wrong-headed and economically punitive\" by the Big Mirror PACs\x97we wouldn't even be having this conversation."
- |
  

- Puppy's tongue is sticking out.
- |
  

- Shameful mainstream-media editorials will claim the puppy is a third-party "spoiler" who wants to confuse the populace and steal votes from the more "electable" little boy next to him, who's been anointed by special-interest cabals and party elites.
- |
  

- But the truth is it shows that people want a new puppy in the kitchen, a puppy of progress and justice, a puppy that demands things like universal health insurance and the repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, a puppy committed to breaking up this two-party elected dictatorship that is becoming more and more like a single golden funnel for the same corporate dollars.
- |
  

- Woman's smile is larger.
- |
  

- We can only conclude she's psychologically overcompensating for still making only 78 cents on the dollar in the male-dominated workplace of 2007 while also still having to fulfill the roles of homemaker, cook, chauffeur, nanny, and maid.
- |
  

- What have the Republicrats done about this wage disparity that is a cancer on the American workforce?
- |
  

- The Republicrats can't even pass the Equal Rights Amendment!
- |
  

- Dog in the front yard is missing.
- |
  

- Where could the watchdog have gone?
- |
  

- Likely through the all-too-common revolving door that leads to a lucrative private-industry job, where he'll be paid handsomely for his access and insider knowledge.
- |
  

- He's just another player in this flagrant caricature of cash-register politics at its worst.
- |
  

- Outrageous?
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- Surprising?
- |
  

- I truly wish it were.
