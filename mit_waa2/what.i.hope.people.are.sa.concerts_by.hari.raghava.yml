- I like the way he does that thing with the palm of his hand.
- |
  

- You know, when he kind of sweeps it off his brow and then tucks it behind his ear?
- |
  

- Then he really gets into the  music, 'cause he can hear better.
- |
  

- It makes sense, and I like him for it.
- I wonder how he was able to get it to hang like that.
- |
  

- Like, right off his scalp?
- |
  

- When he tilts his head, it kind of just floats.
- |
  

- And then he kind of tilts it back again, and does that neck-jerk thing, and it's swaying to and fro, to and fro .
- |
  

- That's probably what I admire most about him.
- |
  

- About his hair, I mean.
- Were you there that time when he was shaking it really hard, right with the drummer?
- |
  

- He was getting so into that one song, and you could really tell because he was shedding  all over the room.
- |
  

- That's what really proved to the rest of us that he was secure and didn't care what anybody thought.
- |
  

- He was digging the music, and he wasn't afraid to show it.
- |
  

- I think that takes guts.
- I'm not even sure if he has any eyes or ears.
- |
  

- That's because when he combs it all down, all you can see is this big black mass, his expanding nostrils, and his pouting red lips.
- |
  

- They all complement each other really well.
- |
  

- It's as if the pouting lips and the expanding nostrils are added proof that he's not messing around.
- |
  

- That he's definitely the real thing.
- Once, he tossed it back really far.
- |
  

- I mean, it almost hit me in the face!
- |
  

- But he was really nice about it.
- |
  

- "He looked over his shoulder and gave me an upward nod\x97as if to say, \"Are you OK ."
- |
  

- "\" He turned around before I could say anything ('cause he needed to pay attention to the next song)."
- |
  

- But I noticed, the next time he did a back-toss, he took a step forward first.
- |
  

- Pretty considerate, I'd say.
- |
  

- And pretty cool!
- Have you ever touched it when it's wet?
- |
  

- My God!
- |
  

- I heard he uses some kind of European spray that you can only get mail-order from Prague or something.
- |
  

- It's the best shit out there, and he refuses to share it with anyone.
- |
  

- What an asshole.
- |
  

- What an incredibly cool asshole .
- |
  

- Some people say it's a wig.
- |
  

- Other people say he uses Rogaine.
- |
  

- I just don't believe he'd do something like that.
- |
  

- I've known him since he was bald.
- |
  

- Right now, he's just grateful he has anything at all.
- |
  

- And we should all be happy for him.
- |
