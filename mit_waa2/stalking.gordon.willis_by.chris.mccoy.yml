- Week One
- When I interviewed for the job of the overnight meat clerk at the local Stop & Shop, the assistant manager was impressed that I graduated with honors (B.
- F.
- A.
- |
  

- Dramatic Writing, NYU), and told me that I should pick up the job quickly.
- "As overnight meat clerk, my principle responsibilities are as follows:    a) Carry the meat from the meat locker to the meat aisle"
- |
  

- Organize the meat
- |
  

- Check the expiration dates on the meat
- |
  

- Organize the meat locker
- One consolation I have as overnight meat clerk is that over the July 4th weekend, I will be able to say that I have touched most of the meat being grilled in my town.
- My other consolation is Gordon Willis, who lives across the street from me.
- |
  

- Cinematographer for the three  Godfather  films and the best Woody Allen movies of the '70s and early '80s, he is a two-time Oscar nominee that pioneered the use of underexposed film and minimalist lighting in establishing the mood of scenes.
- |
  

- Additionally, he is renowned for having crafted the period piece "look" still widely used today, and for creating the prototype of the contemporary visual effects film with 1983's pseudodocumentary  Zelig .
- Sometimes, I watch Gordon Willis mow his lawn.
- He is my only hope to get out of the meat relocation grind.
- |
  

- I have screenplays that should be seen.
- Salvation, right across the street.
- If Gordon was a typical older man, immobile and in need of friendship, I'd go straight up to the door and strike up a conversation, break the ice by asking about the pins on his U.S.
- |
  

- Navy insignia cap, listen to his stories and eat whatever food was offered, something like that.
- |
  

- But judging from the vigor with which he cut his lawn &#8212; using a hand push mower &#8212; he is in good health.
- Just knocking on the door is too transparent.
- |
  

- Any contact needs to be casual.
- |
  

- I need to know when he checks his mail, when he takes the dog for a walk, what he grills on the barbeque, so that I can just happen to walk by, and strike up a conversation.
- The only way for me to make this happen is to watch.
- |
  

- And watching &#8212; when you are a single white male with a low-paying, frustrating, lonely job &#8212; makes you a stalker.
- I know this, but I don't see another way.
- Tomorrow, I begin stalking Gordon Willis.
- |
  

- Week Two
- I have been replaced as the overnight meat clerk by a Czechoslovakian whose work papers came through at the last minute.
- |
  

- He does a better job than I did, and the manager has given him inventory duty &#8212; I never got to do inventory duty &#8212; which involves extensive paperwork and writing.
- The Czech barely speaks English.
- |
  

- It was, essentially, my major.
- I have been relocated to aisle ten &#8212; soda &#8212; where I never even have to check expiration dates.
- |
  

- I'm not sure if this means I've been demoted.
- |
  

- It's something I think about when I'm watching Gordon Willis.
- Gordon remains elusive.
- |
  

- In his front yard, rhododendrons are trimmed, woodchips are spread, gardens are weeded; in his house, lamps are turned off and on.
- |
  

- Yet he hasn't appeared during my surveillance hours, which makes me nervous.
- The weather has been good.
- |
  

- There's no reason for him to stay inside.
- I hope he is okay.
- |
  

- Gordon is okay.
- And so am I, because I have made contact.
- |
  

- Sort of.
- Driving home after work at eight in the morning I saw Gordon checking his mail.
- My street is a dead-end, so watching one's speed is customary, but even still, I think I might have driven too slowly.
- |
  

- Scared old woman slowly.
- |
  

- Drive-by shooting slowly.
- At the time it seemed necessary.
- I raised my hand in greeting well before he looked at me.
- |
  

- We made eye contact.
- |
  

- He returned the gesture.
- I held my smile but cursed the closed car window.
- |
  

- Rotten air conditioning.
- |
  

- A verbal hello would be better than an open hand.
- |
  

- Then we could have one of those conversations where he leans his elbows on the car and we agree to have a cup of coffee tomorrow.
- My car rolled past him.
- I was miserable until a few hours later, when I realized it was Saturday.
- |
  

- Last week, when I watched him mow his lawn, it was also Saturday.
- Gordon Willis comes outside on Saturday.
- |
  

- Week Three
- It is Saturday.
- "There have been some reasons why, up until this point, I haven't felt like a stalker, although I knew I was stalking:    a) My notes on Gordon's movements were mental, not written down"
- |
  

- I've never smelled anything worn by Gordon
- But today, I woke up early, so I wouldn't miss him.
- |
  

- I didn't work last night, so I'd be rested.
- |
  

- I watched the  Godfather  movies &#8212; even part three.
- |
  

- I watched  Annie Hall .
- |
  

- I watched  All The Presidents Men .
- |
  

- I searched for Gordon's 1980 directorial debut  Windows , but couldn't find it.
- |
  

- The guy at Blockbuster said nobody watched Talia Shire movies anymore.
- I am leaning against my house, looking at Gordon carry a piece of wood.
- |
  

- He puts it down and has a good stretch, easily holding both arms above his head.
- |
  

- The physical activity does not make him cough.
- |
  

- He is a peerless senior.
- I don't know if the stretch means he's going to get more wood, or that he's done for the day.
- I need to go now.
- I walk towards my mailbox like I am getting the mail.
- |
  

- After passing the hydrangeas, I lift my hand high.
- |
  

- Gordon notices and responds with his own lifted hand.
- My entire world can be defined by Gordon Willis movies.
- I am a poor worker that needs a favor from Don Corleone.
- I am Robert Redford about to ask Deep Throat for the answers.
- I am Woody Allen, twitching while I move.
- The summer light hits my face in subdued yellows and browns.
- I walk toward Gordon Willis.
- His hand is dirty from carrying the wood.
- |
  

- I shake it hard.
- "\"I'm Chris,\""
- |
  

- I say.
- |
  

- "\"I live across the street."
- I loved The Godfather.
- "\"Gordon."
- |
  

- Nice to meet you,"
- |
  

- "\"What are you doing?"
- "\" I say, and point at the piece of wood."
- I've got this great movie idea.
- "\"Building a step."
- |
  

- You can't get to the road from this part of the yard, so I figured it was time.
- "\"Sounds good."
- Hey, didn't Manhattan have steps in it?
- "\"Well, I like to keep busy,\""
- |
  

- "\"So&#8230; how are you going to build the step?"
- I need you, Gordon.
- "\"Well, I'm thinking about cutting into the hill here and here,\""
- |
  

- "\"Seems like the right idea."
- You're all I've got.
- "\"Hope so."
- "\"How many&#8230; pieces&#8230; of wood&#8230; are you going to use?"
- I'll build the step for you.
- "\"Not sure, yet."
- "\"Looks like&#8230; five&#8230; could work?"
- I will carry and organize your meat.
- We talk about building the step for the next ten minutes.
- |
  

- I am unable to change the subject to film or my career.
- |
  

- Then we shake hands, he goes in his house, and I go in mine.
- He's a very nice guy.
- I will work in a supermarket the rest of my life.
- I wonder what is below soda.
