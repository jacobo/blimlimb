- Or maybe there and later.
- "Because in the final analysis, isn't that the very picture of a true American: A man who may or may not be wearing a false beard, who may even have forgotten to shave, but who, underneath it all, and taken all in all, is the salt of the earth?"
- We applaud them all.
- Let it be understood that we are not by any means advocating new legislation along these lines, although there are many plausible arguments for it&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;too many to enumerate here.

- Nor are we necessarily opposed to such a law, despite the many convincing reasons for taking such a stance&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;more reasons than you could shake a stick at.
- Of course if you did shake a stick at them, at least it wouldn't go "Bang!
- "\" and kill three innocent bystanders."
- "Yet we must ask ourselves, since no one else is listening: Can anyone be said, in this day and age and in today's society, to be truly innocent?"
- |
  

- Or were they possibly enemies of the state?
- |
  

- And if so, which state?
- |
  

- If it were Alabama, could we blame them?
- |
  

- Or should we applaud them, too?
- The issue of state's rights requires careful and serious consideration.
- |
  

- Let us merely state that all states have or should have state's rights, that they have the right to state those rights, and that one of those rights is the right to state that state's rights are, by right, those rights belonging only to states.
- We don't know how to put our position any more simply than that.
- It's only our opinion, but we're prepared to stand firmly behind it, where nobody can find us.
