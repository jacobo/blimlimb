- BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE.
- By  Jules Lipoff
- She exposed me to excessive ultraviolet radiation, which gave me terrible cataracts.
- She removed all traces of vitamin A from my diet.
- She launched well-targeted projectiles at my eyes, causing severe trauma.
- She poisoned me repeatedly with steroids, which over time caused the formation of a pituitary tumor that pressed against my optic chiasm severing my optic-nerve pathways.
- She replaced my contact-lens solution with corrosive acid.
- She unleashed upon me lab rats trained to preferentially eat eyes.
- She, my ophthalmologist, botched my Lasik surgery.
- She exacerbated my diabetes by replacing my insulin with Frappuccino, which led to retinal problems.
- She put me under general anesthesia and surgically removed my eyes.
- She altered my parents' germ-cell chromosomes before my conception so that I lack the proper genetic code to distinguish the colors red and green.
- She calibrated a refraction experiment with her laser pointer that scorched my retinas.
