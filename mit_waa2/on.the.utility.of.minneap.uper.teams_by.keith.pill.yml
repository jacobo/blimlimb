  Spider-Man:  Poor. The lack of a single, concentrated downtown area would
  greatly hinder Spider-Man's preferred method of transportation. Given that
  there's not much higher than three stories after you get out of the two
  downtowns, swinging from building to building isn't going to work. It's not
  difficult to imagine Spider-Man standing on Nicollet Mall in downtown
  Minneapolis, hearing that thugs have taken over the Xcel Center over in St.
  Paul, and cursing under his breath as he runs to I-94, forced to affix a web
  to the top of a bus and ride it across town.
  The X-Men:  So-so. Their initial problem would be that no one around here
  seems to have much of a problem with mutants. With no one trying to wipe
  them out, the X-Men would lose some of their edge. They would run the risk
  of turning into hypersensitive college kids who go around looking for the
  slightest excuse to be outraged.
  They'd have more of a reason to stick around, though, after the
  inevitable burst of mutant jokes on the local classic-rock morning show.
  Those guys can be very cruel.
  Batman:  Also so-so. No real deal-breakers to Batman setting up shop here,
  but lots of annoying obstacles: lack of dramatic places to stand and brood
  over the cityscape; difficulty of driving the Batmobile at high speeds
  through some of the St. Paul street vortices (watch the ice on the road!);
  necessity of getting cozy with two police chiefs instead of one
  commissioner; and lack of a paralyzing, all-pervading criminal culture
  (although he'd be welcome to come to my neighborhood, starting with the
  three middle-aged fat guys who think riding little putt-putt scooters three
  abreast at 20 mph down Minnehaha Parkway is AWESOME).
  Superman:  No problem.
  The Incredible Hulk:  No problem. Hulk's in the Superman club. When your main
  thing is smashing things, location is less of a factor. Hulk could smash
  very effectively in Falcon Heights, for example.
  Wonder Woman:  Poor. People around here just wouldn't cotton to a woman
  dressed like that, especially one carrying a magic lasso. Well, some folks
  would like that quite a bit, but some would make a stink about it.
  Aquaman:  Most people seem to like him, but Garrison doesn't, so it's a
  no-go.
