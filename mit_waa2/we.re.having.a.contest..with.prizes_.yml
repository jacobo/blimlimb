- Several weeks ago we ran a piece by Dan Wiencek called " Thirteen Writing Prompts .

- A wasp called the tarantula hawk reproduces by paralyzing tarantulas and laying its eggs into their bodies.
- |
  

- When the larvae hatch, they devour the still living spider from the inside out.
- |
  

- Isn't that fucked up?
- |
  

- Write a short story about how fucked up that is.
- Soon, people were submitting stories they had written using the prompts as jumping-off points.
