  "What's the matter with him? I never saw Nick act like that." &#151;George
  Bailey
  You remember Nick&#151;the barman at Martini's. Starched white shirt, neat bow
  tie. A good bartender and a good man. The last man, in fact, to show George
  Bailey some kindness before he heads out into the snow, desperate and
  alone, to take his own life. How is it then, in a world without George,
  that of all people,  Nick  becomes such a scumbag?
  At Martini's, the atmosphere is festive. It's Christmas Eve and the inn is
  full. Behind the bar, however, the ever-solicitous Nick notices that George
  Bailey is definitely not in the holiday spirit. He seems to be on the verge
  of tears. "You alright, George?" he inquires discreetly. "Want somebody to
  take you home?"  George demurs. The scene ends when a man at the end of the
  bar punches George in the face. Nick helps George to his feet and out the
  door, toward his fated rendezvous with Clarence Oddbody, Angel Second
  Class.
  In idyllic Bedford Falls, Nick is a mild-mannered helpmeet, a man of
  apparently modest ambitions, content in his career as a barman for the
  equally kindly Mr. Martini, tavern owner (and Building & Loan customer).
  But in Pottersville, Nick is no longer anybody's second-in-command. Gone is
  the crisply dressed, polite young man. At "Nick's", the establishment that
  Martini's has become in this parallel universe, he is clearly the man in
  charge&#151;and loving it. Hair greased back, eyelids at half mast he is the
  surly center of attention, a tough guy sporting a loud shirt and a
  clashing, polka-dot bow-tie (Like everything else in "It's a Wonderful
  Life," fashion sense is also linked to George Bailey's existence.) Even his
  voice swaggers.
  "I'm the boss around here," he tells George and Clarence. But Nick's not
  merely the boss, feeling his oats&#151;he's deliberately unpleasant. Mean.
  Nasty.
  Nick is... an asshole.
  In his brief exchange with George and Clarence&#151;whom he takes to be, well,
  out of place&#151;Nick becomes increasingly annoyed: "We serve hard drinks in
  here for men who want to get drunk, fast, and we don't need any
   'characters'  around to give the joint  'atmosphere' , is that clear?"
  He offers the duo a look of sheer disgust after Clarence&#151;who has just
  heard a ringing cash register&#151;exclaims, "Every time you hear a bell ring,
  it means that some angel's just got his wings." Seconds later Nick ejects
  the duo. "That does it," he barks. "Out you two pixies go, through the door
  or out the window!"
  Obviously, George Bailey's ceasing to exist wrecks many lives. But what
  exactly is the deal with Nick? What went so wrong, so fast?  Herewith,
  possible explanations:
  The Potternomics theory. Perhaps Nick has had to toughen up, just to
  survive. In Pottersville, a town where just one man rules with an iron
  fist, a discontented, lazy rabble falls prey to unemployment, prostitution
  and crime. Downtown is a maelstrom of poolhalls, pawn brokers and seedy

  demented piano music. (The only thing "Nick's" seems to be missing is a

  Nature vs. nurture. Was trouble always lurking inside Nick, or did
  Pottersville turn a nice guy into a thug? Well, Pottersville has certainly
  compromised others who earlier epitomized virtue and kindness. Look at
  George Bailey's mother, now a bitter woman running a flophouse. His saintly
  wife is now a mousy librarian. Reduced to civic prole, Bert the cop
  discharges his sidearm into a crowd. Meanwhile, the possibly alcoholic
  taxi-driver, Ernie, is cuckolded and living in a Potter shanty. In a
  Georgeless world, Violet Biggs-a flashy tart whom George ultimately kept
  straight&#151;is a quasi-hooker who's loaded into a Pottersville paddy wagon,
  kicking and screaming. Troubled lives all, yet only Nick is actually
   thriving.  Deprived of George Bailey's nourishing influence on the town,
  Nick is reduced to his true nature: goon. And in Pottersville, goons come
  out on top.

  And there's more. Nick appears in Martini's for the first time the very
