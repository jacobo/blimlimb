  On August 2, the McSweeney's Representative makes for Reykjavik, to get
  the third issue of the print version printed.
  This means that if you have any intention or hope of receiving this issue
  any time in, say, August, you need to send in those subscription checks
  now. ($28, to McSweeney's, 394A Ninth Street, Brooklyn, NY 11215.
  Canadians pay $34.) All new subscriptions received by the end of this week will
  be entered into the database before press, and those subscribers will
  be sent their copies straight from Boston, when the ship hits shore.
  Subscriptions received thereafter will be subject to our sometimes-slow
  fulfillment process. [A process which, by the way, will be overhauled
  next week. McSweeney's has secured help for this task&nbsp;-- all those who
  have waited patiently will be soon rewarded meagerly.]
  Also, the subscription price will soon rise, as production costs are
  rising. Why are production costs rising? Here is why:
  While the first issue was about 140 pages, and the second issue was
  192, the third issue is 288.
  While the first two issues were completely black and white, the third
  issue contains three full-color gatefolds, printed on coated stock. This
  will be very nice, while not actually fouling the purity of the
  black-and-white body of the journal. You will see. It is nice.
  While the first two issues did not contain a page of vellum, the third
  issue will. Everyone likes vellum, but vellum does not come cheap.
  There are other features of Issue No. 3 which should entice you to send
  money right now. Here are some:
  It will contain new work by pretty much everyone who has heretofore
  been associated with McSweeney's. Their work in this issue of
  McSweeney's obliterates everything they have done previously. "I
  renounce all the work I've done before."&nbsp;-- A prominent writer
  At least one of the contributors to this issue is deceased.
  One contributor designs furniture.
  The cover contains at least 2,000 words, much of it printed in 4-pt
  type.
  There is one story that urges the reader to use a pair of scissors to
  better enjoy it.
  There is one story that contains a sex scene between the son of Santa,

  One story takes place in France.
  One story is all about moonshine.
  We cannot reveal much else about this issue, but please know that it is
