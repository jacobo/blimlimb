- So, remember this morning how you were telling everyone that you were taking orders for your daughter's Girl Scout cookie sale?
- |
  

- I have been thinking this over all day, and I want to let you know that I have arrived at a decision.
- |
  

- No, I cannot possibly buy Girl Scout cookies from your daughter at this time.
- First of all, I have never even met your daughter.
- |
  

- That on its own is probably a deal-breaker for me.
- |
  

- Had she come here personally and solicited me herself, I almost certainly would have purchased cookies.
- |
  

- In fact, I definitely would have ordered more than the perfunctory three or four boxes I saw everyone else from the office marked down for.
- |
  

- However, the fact that she has employed you, her mother, in the execution of her sales reflects a lazy, manipulative approach to what could have been a valuable learning  experience and community-building exercise.
- |
  

- The loss of revenue resultant from her failure to close the deal with me is the least of her problems.
- Furthermore, displaying the order form openly at the reception desk was beyond sleazy; it was socially irresponsible.
- |
  

- By making the record of orders public, you generated a volatile atmosphere of concentrated anxieties and clashing egos, and part of me believes this was not done by accident.
- |
  

- Do you fully appreciate the colossal amount of pressure you and your daughter have put on everyone here?
- |
  

- A scarlet letter for him who orders the fewest cookies, and consummate disgrace for those who order none at all!
- The overwhelming weight was nearly enough to bully me into a purchase.
- |
  

- You can see on the form that I did at one point enter an order but later crossed it out.
- |
  

- In my better judgment I have decided to take a stand.
- |
  

- Today, I refuse to be coerced.
- |
  

- I only hope that my actions will help assuage any obligation felt by those who may not be in a place financially to afford to be squandering precious income on cookies.
- |
  

- I do  realize that, myself not included, everyone in the office has already placed orders, but I am also speaking of any morally bankrupt business ventures your daughter may decide to impose on this office in the future.
- I will thank you to relay as much to your daughter.
- |
  

- Also, if you can let her know that, in the case that there is a surplus of Caramel deLites, and she is unable to sell them all, I may be interested in taking some of those off her hands at a substantially discounted price.
