  "They're out at that anti-peace protest at the U.N.," replied Jameson. "You know how it is with kids these days. A few of them start yelling 'Bomb Afghanistan!' or 'Attack Iraq!' and all their friends have to join in. Before you know it, they've started another one of these _____________ and it takes half the force to keep them in line."
  "Well, I wish I was out there too," Sponsky griped, putting the finishing touches on yet another incident report. "All I do is sit here and _____________ around all day."
  "Shhh! It's Esposito!" hissed Jameson.
  "What the hell is he doing here?" The highest-ranking member of the whole Police Department wasn't a common sight around the precinct house.
  "And look who he's got with him!" Marching reluctantly next to Esposito was a handcuffed Vinnie Panini, the notorious Mafioso, collector of logoed apparel, and scourge of marine life everywhere.
