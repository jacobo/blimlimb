  Boswell  persists in tracking my every Movement. I have not yet detected his Motive, but he often beseeches me to "say something memorably wise and pithy," or "discourse on the Immorality of your fellow Man." When I do, or even refrain and tell him I'm too fatigued, he scratches down Notes on a Parchment. To-day I looked up from my Broadsheet whilst sipping a Mug of Ale in the  Spotted Pig  to find him at the End of the Table, observing me as a Scientist does his Microscopic Specimen. We made Contact of the Eyes and he furiously scribbled something before departing with Alacrity. Can you pronounce the Adjective "bizarre"?
  Dec .   2, 1764.
  At first the Attention was flattering, but now it is verging on pathetick;  Boswell  seems to have no Life other than documenting mine. The other Day I asked him if he would not prefer to follow around some attractive aristocratick Lady closer to his own Age, and he replied, with an Expression of utter Sobriety, "Why pursue the Capricious Follies of our Age when I have an Eternal Soul in you?" Then he asked for my Thoughts on Petticoats as a Symbol of engulfing Vanity.

  We were picking Names out of a tri-cornered Hat at the  Spotted Pig  for the traditional Clandestine Gift-Exchange. Unfortunate Event, Number the First: I picked  Boswell . Unfortunate Event, Number the Second:  Boswell  frowned when he read the Name he had picked, then entreated  Oliver Goldsmith  to switch Names with him, and once the Transaction was completed, skipped away whilst giggling to himself.
  Dec .   24, 1764.
  Christmas Eve  at the  Spotted Pig , and  Boswell  presents me with a Fountain-Pen carved of  African  Ivory that definitely cost more than the maximum Allowance of 10 Pence. "Happy Clandestine Gift-Exchange!" he beamed. "Now your Pen shall be as liquid and infinite as your Mind as you complete  Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets !" I had to thank him in front of everyone, then hand over my Gift. "Oh, Dr.  Johnson , how fortuitous that we are each other's Clandestine Gift-Exchangers!" he shouted so everyone could hear. "It is as if Destiny itself had a Hand in the Selection!" When he opened his Present&#8212;a Parchment requesting he physically restrain himself from drawing within two Furlongs of me&#8212;he howled, "I  love  Gifts that play Gags on the Recipient!" and slapped me much too hard on the Back.

  A quiet  Christmas  at Home, savouring  Virgil  in front of my Hearth, when I heard a Knock at my Door. I wish there were some Way of identifying who was calling before I opened the Door, because there stood  Boswell , with a Pot of Stew and a Smile across his Face as if he were consuming Excrement and thoroughly enjoying it. We have absolutely  nothing  to talk about, but we did so nonetheless for five Interminable Hours.

  Here is a Riddle: what is prying, parasitick, and makes a Perfect Ass of himself at your  New Year's  Party? The Answer on all three Accounts is, irrefutably,  Boswell ! After he arrived uninvited (under the Pretense that his Friend "John, whose family Name I cannot recall," told him to come) and had a few Goblets, he paraded around with a Candelabrum atop his Head whilst singing bawdy Songs from  The Beggar's Opera .

  It has been two Fortnights since  Boswell  last talked to me. I saw him at the  Spotted Pig  last Week with  Burke , and I am fairly assured he noticed me before they rapidly exited.

  Valentine's Day . Alone. I sent him a Parchment with several new Witticisms and Axioms of mine two Days ago, but have received no Reply. Here is one I came up with to-day:  One is not aware of what one possessed until the Moment that which was formerly possessed has become absent . Oh, but when did my treasured Fountain-Pen start inking such stilted Prose? I need to forget about him. Perhaps find another Biographer. But where&#8212;the  Spotted Pig ?
