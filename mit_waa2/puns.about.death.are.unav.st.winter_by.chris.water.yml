- "Q: So, mom, you bought burial plots?"
- "Waters: Yes."
- |
  

- For myself, your dad, and your grandparents.
- |
  

- But I never would allow them to contact me afterward, and I never picked out the exact plots.
- "Q: Did you phone-in your order?"
- "Waters: Oh no."
- |
  

- Better than that.
- |
  

- We had a man come to the house.
- "Q: What did he bring with him to the house?"
- |
  

- Maps?
- |
  

- Blueprints?
- "Waters: He brought with him a large display book that stood up on the dining room table."
- "Q: Full color?"
- "Waters: With pretty architectural renderings and, of course, landscaping, but no headstones."
- |
  

- He was very specific about that.
- |
  

- Just plaques in the ground.
- "Q: They don't have headstones?"
- "Waters: Nope."
- |
  

- And no real flowers either.
- |
  

- Just plastic flowers and lights.
- |
  

- Some of the plaques had special messages like "Nana, We Miss You" and "Pop-Pop, You Forgot Your La-Z-Boy.
- "Q: Weird."
- "Waters: So this guy is in our house, with a large stand-up display, and he is telling us how we can always be buried in another state because they have links to a bunch of other memorial parks."
- |
  

- Then, he says to me, "You know you can bury your parents in the same grave.
- |
  

- One on top of the other.
- "Q: What if they don't die at the same time?"
- |
  

- Do they dig the other one up and then throw them both back in the ground?
- "Waters: No. They're buried on levels."
- "Q: So they are not actually \"on top of\" each other."
- "Waters: Oh, in the same coffin?"
- |
  

- No.
- "Q: Right."
- |
  

- Did you go for that option?
- "Waters: Oh, no."
- |
  

- No.  I wanted a place for everyone and everyone kept in place.
- "Q: Now about your plots&#8230;"
- "Waters: I drive by them and wave."
- "Q: Daily?"
- "Waters: I used to when I worked nearby."
- |
  

- Plus, I have the photos from when I was there with Todd.
- "Q: And who is Todd?"
- "Waters: Todd works at the memorial park."
- |
  

- He gives tours of the grounds.
- |
  

- He asked me to come out and pick my plots.
- "Q: So, ten years ago you bought plots, but you didn't pick them out?"
- "Waters: Nope."
- |
  

- I put the papers away.
- |
  

- Didn't want to see them.
- "Q: But then they called you?"
- "Waters: They called pretty much bi-monthly&#8230; for  years ."
- |
  

- Leaving messages like, "Just wondering when you want to come pick out your plots.
- "Q: Did you ever hang up on them?"
- "Waters: Yes."
- |
  

- And I told them, "I am not ready.
- |
  

- Don't push me," and then, "Thank you.
- |
  

- I certainly will.
- "\" But then Todd phoned and, well, who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone?"
- "Q: Did he strike you as off-kilter immediately?"
- "Waters: On the phone?"
- |
  

- No. I mean, he was just so perfect.
- "Q: And he invited you out to the cemetery?"
- |
  

- On Valentine's Day?
- "Waters: Begged me."
- |
  

- "\"Please let me bring this baby home."
- "\" No one was able to get me out there."
- |
  

- And so I said, "
- Okay.
- |
  

- Valentine's Day.
- |
  

- Wear a carnation.
- "\" He seemed so nice."
- |
  

- Until he took the deeds to the plots.
- |
  

- I mean, why take my deeds, and then take off?
- "Q: He just took them and disappeared?"
- "Waters: Yes."
- |
  

- After I left, they promised to mail the deeds to me.
- |
  

- But, instead of putting them in the mail, Todd stole them.
- |
  

- He said that he was hand-delivering them to me.
- "Q: Is that even allowed?"
- "Waters: No! It's not allowed."
- |
  

- It's not heard of at all.
- "Q: But they let him take the deeds anyway?"
- "Waters: Well, they didn't just  let  Todd take the deeds."
- |
  

- He went to file them with the county clerk's office, and after that he took the deeds and took off.
- |
  

- He called them to say that he was delivering the deeds that afternoon.
- "Q: And how long was he gone for?"
- "Waters: About 10 days, I think."
- "Q: Did they fire him?"
- "Waters: I don't know."
- "Q: Because, you know, if you don't show up for work for 10 days, usually they let you go."
- "Waters: Even when you work for cemetery memorial places."
- |
  

- You know people are not dying for those jobs.
- |
  

- And Todd phoned me about two weeks or so later to tell me about a special he had on interments.
- "Q: Oh, so he  did  still have a job there."
- "Waters: Yeah, I guess."
- "Q: Did he mention the stolen deeds?"
- "Waters: He said, \"Did you get the deeds?"
- "\" and I just said, \""
- Indeed I did.
- "Q: He didn't mention running off with them?"
- "Waters: Not a word."
- |
  

- Chatted on as if nothing happened.
- "Q: Did you ask where he had been for 10 days?"
- |
  

- Or were you trying to let the whole thing go?
- "Waters: I thought, \"I had better be polite."
- "Q: Did you ask what he wanted with the deeds?"
- |
  

- It's not like he could do anything with them.
- "Waters: No, I didn't."
- |
  

- I wasn't sure that I wanted to know.
- |
  

- It seemed like he just wanted to hold them.
- |
  

- It's not like he was trying to steal the land from us.
- |
  

- He'd already filed them with the county.
- "Q: Do you think he was striking back at you?"
- |
  

- Because when you went to the cemetery, you kind of messed with Todd, didn't you?
- "Waters: Not exactly."
- "Q: You had him pose in place at the site of your plots for a series of photos."
- "Waters: But prior to the posing he had told me that he had tried out 18 different coffins so he could sell them better."
- |
  

- He told me that his job there is to help people figure out where they want to sleep forever.
- |
  

- And all I could think about were the blinking lights and the light-up Santas and plastic roses.
- "Q: Is he tall?"
- "Waters: Not too tall."
- |
  

- He fit in my grave site.
- "Q: And you're not very tall."
- "Waters: Maybe your height."
- |
  

- I guess a bit taller.
- |
  

- You can get an idea from the photos.
- "Q: How many photos did you take of him?"
- "Waters: I have about five photos of him."
- "Q: At the site?"
- "Waters: Oh, yes."
- "Q: Were the police called in while he was missing?"
- "Waters: I don't know."
- "Q: Would you have presented the photos as some kind of evidence?"
- "Waters: For what?"
- "Q: For a police investigation."
- |
  

- If there had been one.
- "Waters: I didn't see this as criminal."
- |
  

- I felt bad for him.
- |
  

- In fact, I thought maybe I had kinda sorta pushed him over the edge a bit.
- "Q: Pushed him over the edge?"
- "Waters: I don't know, maybe he thought about the day."
- |
  

- It was Valentine's Day, and raining.
- "Q: Maybe Valentine's Day brings him down."
- |
  

- He's not married is he?
- "Waters: I don't think so."
- |
  

- He's young.
- |
  

- Maybe mid- or late-20s.
- |
  

- No older than you.
- "Q: Were your deeds tear-stained?"
- "Waters: No. My deeds were mangled."
- |
  

- Man-handled, or maybe dog-chewed.
- "Q: Do you keep them in a safe place now?"
- "Waters: Yes."
- |
  

- In the bedside table.
- |
  

- Nobody is allowed to look in there.
- "Q: And the plots?"
- "Waters: Well, you know, your grandparents are doing well now, so."
- |
  

- The space is taken care of.
- |
  

- There's a nice view.
- |
  

- You can see the hills.
