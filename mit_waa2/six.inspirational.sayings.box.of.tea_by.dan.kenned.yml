- When life is seen to flow slowly, like a deep river content in its path, the journey is a certain pleasure.
- |
  

- But, God damn it, life's not always a big party, now, is it?
- |
  

- And there's something deeply wrong with your constant tendency to push love away from you so you can spend months on end in total isolation.
- |
  

- Plain and simple, if you see an animal doing that in the wild, there's something wrong with that animal.

- Lighten up before you ruin everything again.

- "Enjoying a delicious cup of our green tea with lemongrass is a start, but I'm serious: deal with life and be a man."

- When birds migrate south to warmer climes, there is no uncertainty within the flock as to why they're undertaking the journey.
- |
  

- But some people ( ahem ) start and stop a journey so many times they begin to make themselves and everyone around them feel weary and forsaken.
- |
  

- Honestly, we're talking about day-to-day goddamn life.
- |
  

- It's a gift, by the way, genius.
- |
  

- And it starts with a cup of our warm English Breakfast blend.
- |
  

- So have a cup, but I swear to Christ above, just relax for 10 seconds about love and death and the rest of what you go crazy with.
- |
  

- Maybe you're right; maybe you've lived in New York too long.
- |
  

- Ah, back to Montana for another week of what?
- |
  

- Clarity?
- |
  

- Is that what this is supposed to be about?
- |
  

- Do you honestly think this system of yours is working?
- |
  

- Every time life deals you a fair-to-middling result or a hard-to-face reality, you just run off to Montana or Colorado?
- |
  

- And to do what?
- |
  

- Mainly, to sit and drink tea and listen to mostly forgotten alternative rock music and some bluegrass on the satellite radio?
- |
  

- This counts as facing life and making the decisions we all have to make?
- |
  

- Impressive that you've got the routine so well oiled as to pick up a box of our Earl Grey tea at the organic co-op in Bozeman after you get off the plane.
- |
  

- But seriously, haven't you had enough of this, this living like a  neurotic, passive-aggressive glory fiend?
- |
  

- Tommy Stinson was right when he said it's not too much to live up to.
- |
  

- Boo!
- |
  

- Ha ha, look at you!
- |
  

- That's all it takes, isn't it?
- |
  

- When a warrior is called to battle, his mood is somber.
- |
  

- When he is hailed in victory, his mood is somber.
- |
  

- Hello?
- |
  

- I'm kidding.
- |
  

- He's anything but somber, isn't he?
- |
  

- That's the point, really .
- |
  

- Feel something instead of the running toward numbness.
- |
  

- The numb, stoic, and terrified are constantly misread as quietly confident.
- |
  

- So is the warrior, though.
- |
  

- Yet he's alive with feeling, whether it's fear of impending battle or  gratitude for his victory.
- |
  

- Is any of this sinking in?
- |
  

- OK, enjoy this cup of our Herbal Hibiscus Citrus Delight, but when you're finished sipping it, start living, for crying out loud.
- |
  

- She was right this time.
- |
  

- Again.

Plain and simple, if you see an animal doing that in the wild, there's something wrong with that animal. Lighten up before you ruin
  everything again. Enjoying a delicious cup of our green tea with lemongrass is a start, but I'm serious: deal with life and be a man.
