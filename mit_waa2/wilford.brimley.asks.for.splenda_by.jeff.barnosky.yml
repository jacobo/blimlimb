- Hey there.
- |
  

- Kyle is it?
- |
  

- Well, hello, Kyle.
- |
  

- I have diabetes.
- |
  

- Now, I know that, as a waiter at a Chili's, you have a lot of important people to wait on, and I know those people can be demanding, but what you have to understand, Kyle, is that I check my blood sugar about 47 times a day, because of my diabetes.
- |
  

- And when you just put down a bunch of packets of pure sugar on the table with my iced tea, well, Kyle, you almost killed me right there.
- Kyle, when you're diabetic, you're entitled to diabetes testing supplies at little or no cost if you're a Medicare beneficiary, which you may or may not have known.
- |
  

- So when you put those 10 packets of Imperial brand sugar on my table here, you did me a great disservice.
- |
  

- "As a diabetic, Kyle, I'm entitled to diabetes testing supplies and I check my blood sugar close to 329 times a day\x97in fact, I've checked my blood sugar 13 times since I sat down to this wonderful little meal of baby back ribs and chips."
- |
  

- So what you did, Kyle, was tantamount to serving an alcoholic a shot of whiskey.
- Let me tell you this, Kyle, and what you have done has left me no choice, really.
- |
  

- I have some pictures of you that your lady friend may not care for.
- |
  

- Not just screwing, Kyle.
- |
  

- All sorts of intimate acts, oral and whatnot, that can be particularly hard for a trusting girlfriend to forgive and impossible to forget.
- |
  

- How can we make this situation better for both of us, Kyle?
- |
  

- Well, that's the real question, isn't it?
- We need to have a little chat, you and I. In this world, we're given a series of choices.
- |
  

- "Moments where we can choose\x97though it may not always seem like it\x97to make the right choice."
- |
  

- Well, Kyle, now is one of those times.
- |
  

- I wish we lived on some different planet, Kyle.
- |
  

- I really do.
- |
  

- One where we didn't get any older, we didn't get diabetes, and we didn't ever die.
- |
  

- But that's not this world, is it, Kyle?
- |
  

- Kyle, I've checked my blood sugar 11 times since you came over here.
- |
  

- I just checked it again.
- |
  

- See that delivery man at the door, Kyle?
- |
  

- Well, he's bringing me more diabetes testing supplies.
- |
  

- That's the kind of world we live in, Kyle.
- How about you do this for me now, Kyle?
- |
  

- "Why don't you walk yourself over to the drink dispenser over there, reach underneath the counter, and pull me out a few packets of Splenda\x97or Equal, if that's all you got."
- |
  

- You'd be helping a tired old man with diabetes and a sense that the world isn't just quite ever going to be what it used to be.
- |
  

- How about getting that Splenda for me, Kyle?
- It's the right thing to do, Kyle.
- |
  

- I think you already knew that.
