- A quiet afternoon in the Bloom household.
- |
  

- LEOPOLD BLOOM  is at the kitchen table, drawing up an ad for a wine merchant named Keyes.
- |
  

- "The work is obviously intense and detail-oriented: one slip of the brush and the whole ad will be ruined."
- |
  

- All of a sudden,  STEPHEN DEDALUS  bursts in through the front door.
- |
  

- "STEPHEN:  In nomine Domini !"
- "BLOOM: ( Dropping his brush and ruining the ad."
- |
  

- Jaysus!
- |
  

- I wish you wouldn't scare me like that!
- "STEPHEN: ( Twirling his ash plant."
- |
  

- "No offense, O fearless, wing\xE8d father, but it's not that hard to scare you."
- |
  

- BLOOM  stares into the camera with an exasperated look on his face.
- |
  

- Audience laughter.
- |
  

- "STEPHEN: I hope you don't mind ."
- |
  

- I've brought along a friend.
- |
  

- Stately, plump  BUCK MULLIGAN  follows  STEPHEN  through the front door.
- |
  

- "BUCK: Hey, Mr. B!"
- "BLOOM: Stephen, I've told you a thousand times not to bring your friends over while I'm trying to work."
- "BUCK: Aww, don't worry, Mr. B. We'll be out of your hair in no time."
- |
  

- We're just stopping by for a couple wineskins on our way to Nighttown.
- |
  

- Isn't that right, Kinch?
- "STEPHEN: ( Slumped on the sofa, reading  A Treatise on Happiness ."
- |
  

- Yeah, whatever.
- "BLOOM: Jaysus!"
- |
  

- MOLLY  appears at the stairhead.
- |
  

- She's wearing hot pants and a rather lascivious top.
- |
  

- BUCK  whistles.
- |
  

- "STEPHEN: Cease your inane caterwauling."
- |
  

- The woman before you wouldn't dare receive your pox-ridden embrace.
- "BUCK: I can still try, can't I? ( Audience laughter."
- |
  

- "MOLLY: O rocks!"
- |
  

- What's all this?
- "BLOOM: I was working on an ad and ."
- |
  

- "STEPHEN: A visiting bard and a wine-mouthed Hippocrates just so happened to drop by."
- "MOLLY: O rocks!"
- |
  

- I was trying to get some sleep!
- "BUCK: Sleep, eh?"
- |
  

- Audience laughter.
- |
  

- There is a knock at the door.
- |
  

- An agitated  BLOOM  rises to answer it.
- |
  

- It's  BLAZES BOYLAN , played by  Growing Pains  star Alan Thicke.
- |
  

- "BLOOM: Jaysus!"
- "STEPHEN:  In nomine Domini !"
- "MOLLY: ( Luxuriantly."
- |
  

- O .
- |
  

- "BUCK: Blazes Boylan, eh?"
- |
  

- Uproarious audience laughter.
- |
  

- "BLAZES: Oh."
- |
  

- Hmm.
- |
  

- I see I've come at a bad time.
- "BUCK: Another young buck out for the missus?"
- "BLOOM: ( Rolling his eyes at the camera."
- |
  

- I think I'll go down to the pub.
- |
  

- Cue theme music.
- |
  

- "Ulysses : The European-Style Crime Thriller"
- |
  

- BLOOM  and  STEPHEN  are sitting in an exceptionally dark pub, drinking Guinness.
- |
  

- Ominous music plays.
- |
  

- They are obviously waiting for someone.
- |
  

- The someone they are waiting for is  FATHER COWLEY , who appears in the doorway as a frighteningly thin silhouette.
- |
  

- His face is ravaged from his cocaine habit.
- |
  

- He rips off his collar before sitting down and ordering a Guinness.
- |
  

- "STEPHEN: Where are they?"
- "COWLEY: They're back in the chapel."
- "BLOOM: ( Angrily."
- |
  

- Fecking out with it, Cowley, you bitch's bastard!
- |
  

- Everyone is silent for a long time.
- |
  

- Closeup shots of  STEPHEN ,  BLOOM , and  COWLEY 's eyes.
- |
  

- "COWLEY: I don't have them."
- "BLOOM: Who the feck does, then?"
- "STEPHEN: You'll excuse my associate's behavior."
- |
  

- His wife is two-timing him.
- "COWLEY: I seem to remember her."
- |
  

- She came to confessional, but I was too coked up to .
- |
  

- "BLOOM: ( Driving a knife into his fetid cheese sandwich."
- |
  

- You can kiss my bloody Irish arse, Cowley!
- "COWLEY: All right!"
- |
  

- I'll give them to you.
- "STEPHEN: Make it quick."
- |
  

- A  BLIND STRIPLING  enters the pub.
- |
  

- The  STRIPLING  cuts an imperious figure in the doorway even though he's just a stripling.
- |
  

- He taps his way to the table with his cane.
- |
  

- Everyone looks frightened.
- |
  

- The  STRIPLING  sits down and orders two Guinnesses.
- |
  

- "STRIPLING: Are these the famous con men?"
- |
  

- "Mr. Dedalus and Mr. Bloom\x97if that's you\x97it's a pleasure to finally meet."
- |
  

- Cowley just can't stop talking about you.
- "COWLEY: ( Grinning nervously."
- |
  

- Aye.
- |
  

- It's true.
- "STRIPLING: Gentlemen, you tell me there's a controlled substance in dear dirty Dublin that is not under your control."
- |
  

- You offer me your protection and I agree to help you.
- |
  

- And this man ( directing an unseeing hand at  FATHER COWLEY) has stood in the way of our happiness.
- |
  

- Does that make you angry?
- "BLOOM: Like bloody hell it does!"
- "STRIPLING: ( Draws his gun and holds it to  FATHER COWLEY 's forehead."
- |
  

- Very good.
- |
  

- I propose we get rid of him.
- |
  

- STEPHEN  and  BLOOM  draw their guns.
- |
  

- FATHER COWLEY , terrified, withdraws a package from his coat and throws it on the table.
- |
  

- "COWLEY: I didn't agree to this, stripling!"
- "STRIPLING: Just do what these gentlemen tell you."
- "STEPHEN: Open the package."
- |
  

- FATHER COWLEY  opens the package, revealing 200 bars of Irish potato soap.
- |
  

- "BLOOM: Fecking grade-A it is."
- "STEPHEN: You've pleased us."
- |
  

- We're going to go urinate against a wall now.
- |
  

- Cocking his gun.
- |
  

- Don't try anything while we're gone.
- |
  

- FATHER COWLEY  and the  STRIPLING  remain seated at the table, forced to listen to the sound of  STEPHEN  and  BLOOM  relieving themselves.
- |
  

- Then the  STRIPLING  cocks his gun and nods to  FATHER COWLEY .
- |
  

- "STRIPLING: Let's go."
- "COWLEY: Right."

- The two go outside and begin firing.
