- Alaska governor  SARAH PALIN  is taking a rare afternoon off from work.
- |
  

- She walks by a strip mall.
- |
  

- Like all Alaskan strip malls, it contains a moose supply store, a pizza parlor, and a doctors' office.
- |
  

- She stops to admire the moose-supply-store window and almost bumps into a  DOCTOR .
- |
  

- DOCTOR
- Hello.
- |
  

- I'm an obstetrician.
- SARAH PALIN
- Well, hello.
- |
  

- I'm a politician.
- DOCTOR
- Good day, madam.
- SARAH PALIN
- Good day, sir.
- I'm not pregnant.
- DOCTOR
- Who said you were?
- |
  

- A few days later,  SARAH PALIN  returns to the doctors' office.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- I've been so busy
- With governance
- That I've neglected
- To be inspected.
- I'd like to have an exam now, please.
- DOCTOR
- Get on the table and raise your knees.
- |
  

- The  DOCTOR  determines that  SARAH PALIN  is pregnant.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- Holy moly!
- Sakes alive!
- I have four kids.
- This makes five.
- |
  

- A few months later,  SARAH PALIN  is at a conference.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- We need to make the country work
- For ordinary folk.
- Direct reform must be the norm,
- And .
- |
  

- Oops, my water broke.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN  flies home to Alaska to have the baby.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- We'll call him Trig.
- It means "strength" in Norse.
- We'll care for him, raise him,
- And love him, of course.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN  continues to govern the state, tend to her family, help her husband with his business, and find time for herself.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- Take that, Murkowski!
- It's dinnertime, kids!
- Goodbye, Bridge to Nowhere!
- Hello, dogsled skids!
- Need haircut, need yoga!
- Need food for the house!
- Need to remember
- To pick up that blouse!
- Drill here, drill now!
- No, not you, Todd!
- An hour till hockey,
- Then the Iditarod.
- |
  

- One afternoon,  SARAH PALIN 's teenage daughter  BRISTOL PALIN  approaches her.
- |
  

- BRISTOL PALIN
- Mom,
- We have to talk.
- SARAH PALIN
- Come with me
- While I walk.
- The guys at work all call it
- My morning constitutional.
- That's what passes for a joke.
- Politics is institutional.
- BRISTOL PALIN
- Mom,
- I think I'm late.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN 's phone rings.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- One second.
- In this state,
- Where ethical breaches
- And pork-filled bills are legion,
- We need a real reformer
- To rectify the region.
- BRISTOL PALIN
- Mom,
- I need you now.
- SARAH PALIN
- My schedule
- Won't allow
- A heart-to-heart till Thursday.
- BRISTOL PALIN
- Mom, listen, I'm pregnant!
- SARAH PALIN
- "Well, now I'm  boulevers\xE9e ."
- I think of you as a child still, a
- Tomboy on the loose in Wasilla,
- Though I see that you are a woman now.
- We have to fix this soon.
- |
  

- But how?
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN  visits her daughter's boyfriend,  LEVI JOHNSTON .
- |
  

- As she approaches him, she hears him bragging to his friends.
- |
  

- LEVI JOHNSTON
- I shot, I scored.
- The puck is in the goal.
- I shot, I scored.
- We didn't practice birth control,
- Or gun control, for that matter.
- Easy-Bake Oven, meet baby batter.
- I may have mixed a metaphor,
- But what do I care?
- I shoot, I score!
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN  clears her throat.
- |
  

- LEVI JOHNSTON  turns to see the governor standing beside him.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- I hunt with a shotgun,
- Not a musket or pistol.
- I'm holding one now.
- Will you marry my Bristol?
- LEVI JOHNSTON
- I'm an effing redneck, ma'am.
- It says so on my MySpace page.
- I'm not sure I can marry her,
- Because, well, we're both underage.
- SARAH PALIN
- You two can marry.
- We'll have a wedding.
- Otherwise, it'll be
- You I'm beheading.
- I'll come down on you like an atom bomb.
- LEVI JOHNSTON
- Well, uh, I mean, can I call you Mom?
- |
  

- Across the country,  JOHN McCAIN  is meeting with  CHARLIE BLACK  and  RICK DAVIS  to decide whom to pick for vice president.
- |
  

- JOHN McCAIN
- I think I want
- Joe Lieberman.
- CHARLIE BLACK
- With him, there's no way
- You can win.
- JOHN McCAIN
- Well, what about Tom Ridge instead?
- CHARLIE BLACK
- Do that and your campaign is dead.
- RICK DAVIS
- We need a conservative who can serve.
- JOHN McCAIN
- You jerks are getting on my last nerve.
- |
  

- The phone rings in the Palin home.
- |
  

- TODD PALIN
- Sarah, phone.
- It's John McCain.
- SARAH PALIN
- The guy from  Die Hard ?
- I love that movie.
- TODD PALIN
- No, the senator.
- SARAH PALIN
- Oh, OK.
- |
  

- Groovy.
- |
  

- JOHN McCAIN  offers her a spot on the Republican ticket.
- |
  

- JOHN McCAIN
- Is there anything
- I need to know
- About your family?
- SARAH PALIN
- No. Although,
- Now that you mention it,
- Once, back in the '80s,
- Todd was driving tipsy
- And dinged up a Mercedes.
- JOHN McCAIN
- You sure
- That's all?
- SARAH PALIN
- That's all
- I recall.
- JOHN McCAIN
- That's really
- Quite small.
- Excellent.
- |
  

- You've got the job.
- Rick and Charlie can polish my knob.
- |
  

- McCAIN  picks her.
- |
  

- Though the Obama campaign does not criticize  SARAH PALIN  directly, they dispatch an army of winged, fanged  DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES  to do so.
- |
  

- DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 1
- How can she
- Care for her infant son
- And also help
- The country run?
- DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 2
- The baby's not hers.
- It belongs to her daughter.
- The water that broke
- Wasn't really her water.
- DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 3
- She's like a spy
- Working in our midst,
- A hot one who is
- A separatist.
- DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 4
- The University
- Of Idaho?
- Where is that, even?
- I don't know.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN  issues a folksy response.
- |
  

- SARAH PALIN
- Come on, that's just not fair of you.
- I'm going to hunt caribou.
- Then I'll go for stag.
- |
  

- Then I'll go for bear.
- Corrupt politicians should also beware.
- I'm locked.
- |
  

- I'm loaded.
- D.
- C.
- |
  

- The old way's dying.
- The underlying
- Causes are too great to number.
- For starters, power makes you dumber.
- It tends to encumber the heart and the spirit.
- Silence your inner voice until you can't hear it.
- That's what's happening, you see,
- To the Democratic nominee.
- I won't do that.
- |
  

- Don't forget
- I auctioned off a private jet.
- I'll listen to myself.
- I'll listen to my Lord.
- I'll listen to my family.
- And we will be restored.
- |
  

- JOHN McCAIN , moved by her straight talk and her reformer's instinct, steps down from the ticket.
- |
  

- The Supreme Court, also moved, permits it.
- |
  

- Her opponents in the election,  BARACK OBAMA  and  JOE BIDEN , find themselves overcome with emotion as well; Biden cries so hard that his hair plugs pop out of his head.
- |
  

- On Election Day, 100 percent of female voters cast ballots for  SARAH PALIN , who is elected in a landslide.
- |
  

- "SARAH PALIN  presides over two terms of peace and prosperity, during which time she and Todd have five more children: Haley, Window, Gossamer, Shemp, and John."
