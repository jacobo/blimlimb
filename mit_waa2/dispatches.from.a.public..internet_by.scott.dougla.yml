- Elderly patrons are very sweet people who very frequently bring me food, tell me how much they appreciate the library&#8217;s presence in the neighborhood, and small-talk about their favorite mysteries and true-crime books.

- They&#8217;re pleasant to be around&#8212;unless they want to use a computer.
- |
  

- I am convinced that grandkids are inherently evil people who tell their grandparents to &#8220;just go to the library and open up an e-mail account&#8212;it&#8217;s free and so simple.

- Of course, the free part gets them to the library in swarms, and, of course, they don&#8217;t want to take part in the library&#8217;s free Internet classes, because .
- |
  

- I don&#8217;t need a class, because my grandkid said it was simple, and you can just show me the basics.
- |
  

- One such elderly patron came to the library not too long ago with such ideals.
- |
  

- Strangely, his trouble was not so much opening an e-mail account as it was using the print card.
- Print cards are pesky little things librarians institute for the sake of harassing patrons and discouraging them from printing anything.
- |
  

- Often, it works, but this little old man was persistent.
- |
  

- I showed him step by step what to do to print, and he was doing pretty well.
- |
  

- "He seemed to be paying careful attention: he hit the print button like a pro, walked to the print station like a king."
- |
  

- Then he screwed up&#8212;big time.
- |
  

- At the print station, another patron told me some teenagers had just said the &#8220;f&#8221; word to her five-year-old son and then ran off to the boys&#8217; room, where she was pretty sure they were up to no good.
- |
  

- I told the elderly gentleman to hang tight and I&#8217;d be right back to help him.
- I learned in just a short time that expecting him to hang tight was a mistake.
- |
  

- When I returned to the man, he looked hopelessly confused.
- |
  

- It didn&#8217;t work,&#8221; he explained, frustrated.
- |
  

- And it won&#8217;t give me my print card back.
- |
  

- I walked to the print station and stared for several seconds at the card reader.
- |
  

- I studied it from several angles but did not see his card.
- |
  

- You&#8217;re sure it didn&#8217;t come out?
- |
  

- I asked.
- |
  

- He nodded, but then pointed at his computer.
- |
  

- It&#8217;s in there.
- |
  

- I looked at the computer, confused.
- |
  

- He pointed at the floppy-disk drive and said, &#8220;I tried pushing the button, but it still won&#8217;t come out.
- |
  

- I kneeled down and immediately saw the print card wedged deep inside the floppy-disk drive.
- |
  

- I had seen paper clips, scrap paper, and pencils inside the floppy-disk drive, but this was the first print card.
- I went to the workroom to get out some tweezers, and when I returned, the man was gone.
- |
  

- I never saw him again.
- "Tale #2: In Which a Patron Decides to Record the Internet"
- Because I work in a small branch library with only a dozen or so Internet terminals (all of which are very close to where I sit), it has become a habit to do my best to ignore what patrons are viewing, so as to ensure their privacy.
- |
  

- Last week, however, I noticed a woman sit down at a computer and pull from her small handbag a video camera.
- |
  

- She logged in to her e-mail account, turned on her recorder, and proceeded to record messages that had been sent to her inbox.
- |
  

- Using a video camera in a city building without prior consent from the city is not allowed, but I let her do it for a few minutes, more for the sake of personal amusement and curiosity than anything else.
- |
  

- Finally, after about five minutes, I became bored watching the woman, so I approached her and explained that she would have to get city approval if she wanted to use her video camera in the library.
- |
  

- She rolled her eyes and said, &#8220;Well, I was finished anyway.
- |
  

- She stuffed her camera back into her bag, looked suspiciously around, and left in a hurry.
- "Tale #3: In Which a Patron Has a Little Too Much Fun"
- There are different types of Internet users who visit the library.
- |
  

- There&#8217;s the casual user, who uses the library&#8217;s Internet service perhaps once a month; the regular user, who uses it every day; the college user, who comes to the library only when their school&#8217;s lab is full; and many other types, which I&#8217;ll leave out for no real reason.
- This final tale involves what I would describe as a regular user.
- |
  

- I rarely saw him doing anything on the computer except sending and reading e-mail.
- |
  

- He was quiet and never asked for help on the Internet.
- |
  

- Then one day, as I was helping a younger patron find a book for his state-report assignment, the man came to me seeking help with printing.
- When I got to his computer, I saw a picture of an overweight, fully nude Caucasian woman holding a jar of peanut butter.
- |
  

- I told the man that this kind of material went against the library&#8217;s Internet usage policy.
- |
  

- "I have had to explain this policy to several patrons who have used the Internet terminals to view pornographic images, and every time, the patron does one of three things: they act embarrassed and apologize for their actions, they nod and quickly leave, or they try to defend their actions by saying that they are a taxpayer and can look at whatever they want to on the computer."
- This man, however, explained quite seriously that, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you weren&#8217;t allowed to look at pornography on the Internet.
- |
  

- I nodded and pointed at the large sign above the computers, which stated clearly the library&#8217;s stance on this issue.
- The man nodded and asked if he could still print the picture.
- |
  

- I said no and added that, because he&#8217;d abused the library&#8217;s policy (a major no-no), he would now be banned from using the Internet.
- |
  

- He nodded; then, to my surprise, flipped over a computer printout of a nude woman; and left with no further comment.
- I did not bother asking how he was able to print the other picture without help.

  Dispatch 8: Three Tales of the Internet
  Tale #1: In Which an Elderly Patron Unintentionally Tries to Destroy a Computer

  Of course, the free part gets them to the library in swarms, and, of course, they don&#8217;t want to take part in the library&#8217;s free Internet classes, because ... well, in the words of one elderly patron, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need a class, because my grandkid said it was simple, and you can just show me the basics.&#8221; One such elderly patron came to the library not too long ago with such ideals.
