- Character's struggle against nature
- Hello, dog.
- |
  

- You are going to move?
- |
  

- Yes, yes, yes?
- |
  

- No? I am human, you are canine.
- |
  

- "We are different, but know this: I will run you over if you don't get out of the street."
- |
  

- Dog!
- |
  

- Are you trying to bring me to a halt?
- |
  

- "How often I forget that I can reconnect myself to the great web of life with just a simple message: BEEEEEEP, BEEEEEEEP."
- Character's struggle against an antagonist
- The thing is, I need to be at my dentist's appointment.
- |
  

- If you don't let me turn left onto Cedar, I will be unable to make my appointment.
- |
  

- Why are you going the exact same speed as me?
- |
  

- I go 30, you go 30.
- |
  

- I go 40, you go 40.
- |
  

- I do an illegal U-turn, you do an illegal U-turn.
- Perhaps if we were all going to the same place, I'd just go with the flow.
- |
  

- But I've been going with the flow, trying to get in the left-hand-turn flow, and no one is letting me do it.
- |
  

- And you, ma'am, are obviously doing everything you can to prevent me from getting to my personal destination.
- |
  

- "Hear me when I say this: BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEEEEEP."
- Character's struggle against society
- The road has three lanes.
- |
  

- The SUV is using two of them at any given moment.
- |
  

- "This raises a question, first raised by Plato in  The Republic : What is justice?"
- |
  

- Specifically, when given a scarce resource (the road), how do you distribute the scarce resource among the potential recipients (the drivers)?
- |
  

- "This particular SUV is suggesting a reprisal of Thrasymachus's definition of justice: whatever is done by the powerful is what is just."
- |
  

- Following Plato, I voice my dissent, by pressing hard on my horn for seven seconds, followed by three quick BEEP, BEEP, BEEPs.
- Struggle between competing elements
- |
  

- Sweet world, how much I have shared with you!
- |
  

- I have withdrawn from you, wearied by my conflicts.
- |
  

- I want peace.
- |
  

- Will I be able to find it by withdrawing, thinking, eating, and driving?
- As I withdraw from the world, I find it difficult to breathe.
- One second I am savoring the taste of this BBQ chicken wing while driving, but now so very much of the chicken is stuck between my tonsils and the back part of my tongue.
- |
  

- I can't breathe, I can't think clearly, all I can do is slump over as everything becomes very blurry.
- |
  

- "Thanks for hearing me out\x97 BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP."
- |
  

- BEEP.
- |
  

- BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.
- |
  

- BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.
