- A DISPATCH BY  JAMES WAGNER

- Read James Wagner's  first ,  second ,  third  and  fourth  dispatches from the hardware store.

- CENTRAL NEW YORK &#151; I work in Plumbing with a man in his seventies who tends to disappear from the scene at about the time when customers start to arrive.
- It started on my first day at the hardware store, when I needed help answering customers' questions.
- |
  

- I walked past all three plumbing-related aisles, and even over to adjacent aisles.
- |
  

- He wasn't in any of them.
- I called him on the phone he carries.
- |
  

- He didn't answer.
- I began looking up the aisles again.
- |
  

- He wasn't there.
- I walked up the main aisle to see if he was at Returns, getting a cart of returned merchandise.
- |
  

- He wasn't there, either.
- I decided to give up on finding him and was about to tell the customers I didn't know the answers to their questions when I spotted him.
- |
  

- He was way down at the other end of the building.
- |
  

- In Electrical.
- |
  

- And he was walking away from Electrical, and farther away from Plumbing.
- I started to walk toward him.
- |
  

- He disappeared around the corner.
- |
  

- I yelled down the aisle, but he didn't come back.
- |
  

- I continued walking down to where I thought he was.
- |
  

- It took me about fifteen to twenty seconds to get there.
- I guessed he was in Receiving, where all the new merchandise is brought in.
- |
  

- But I couldn't see him, as there were huge boxes and equipment blocking my view.
- |
  

- The place seemed to be empty.
- I walked in a little farther, looking around a shipment of doors.
- |
  

- But I still didn't see him.
- As I edged my way around pallets, shipments, equipment, and garbage bags, I finally came into a bit of a clearing, and that's when I saw him.
- He was in the back of Receiving, where the Receiving computer is, in a room with three walls, if you will.
- |
  

- There was no door, just a wide opening.
- |
  

- It was through this opening that I saw him reading something on the desk.
- He didn't know I was there, so I watched him for a while, to see what he was doing.
- It looked very much like he wasn't doing anything.
- |
  

- He was just lazily picking up things, putting them down, looking at things stuck on the wall.
- I waited a few more seconds.
- Then I shouted to him, "Hey.
- He turned quickly, nervously, like people do when you catch them doing something they're not supposed to be doing.
- To mask this, he became upset.
- |
  

- He said, "Yeah, what.
- Undeterred, I said, "What are you doing back here?
- He started mumbling something, something completely unintelligible, and started walking toward me.
- |
  

- He calmed down a bit as he approached.
- I told him I needed help with customers.
- He didn't say anything.
- |
  

- He just started walking out of Receiving back to Plumbing.
- As I walked with him, I noticed he wasn't carrying a form from Special Services.
- |
  

- You need a form from Special Services to pick anything up in Receiving.
- |
  

- He wasn't carrying anything at all.
- When we finished helping the customers, I watched to see if he would go back to Receiving, which would probably go some way to disproving my idea that he wasn't doing anything.
- |
  

- I figured if he went right back to Receiving, it might mean he really was searching for some something, that he might have some legitimate purpose.
- He didn't return to Receiving.
- |
  

- Instead, he walked away from Plumbing to the faucets display area.
- |
  

- This was very sneaky of him, because we are supposed to handle faucets as well, but there are never many customers back there.
- |
  

- And usually someone from Kitchen and Bath, which is adjacent to the faucets display area, will let us know we have a customer, because we can't see directly into the faucets display area.
- |
  

- There are life-sized displays of kitchen cabinets, refrigerators, and stacks of microwaves, among other things in front of the faucets display area.
- |
  

- After that first day, I came to realize he spends most of his time in the faucets display area.
- One day when I was back there, I looked up at the faucets and was stunned by what I saw.
- |
  

- Off to the left, hanging on a support beam, in plain sight of customers, was an eight-by-ten framed picture of him.
- |
  

- He was smiling.
- |
  

- Broadly.
