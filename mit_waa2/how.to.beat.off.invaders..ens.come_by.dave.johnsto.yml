- Let me begin by telling you that I forgive you.
- |
  

- Sure, I am a little bitter, but that is only because I am writing this while still alive.
- |
  

- But I do realize that you didn't kill me, the aliens did, due to the fact that I was the only person on this planet who had their head on a swivel alienwise.
- |
  

- Sure, you contributed to my death by not listening to me about turning our Laser Floyd technology into an anti-alien super weapon, but I'm dead, so just forget I mentioned it.
- |
  

- But enough about me and my tragically early you-caused death; let's talk about what you're going to do about the aliens who have arrived on your, formerly my, planet.
- First, you have to forget the idea that aliens are all that.
- |
  

- They are neither that nor a bag a chips.
- |
  

- Who built the pyramids?
- |
  

- Heavily beaten slaves.
- |
  

- What is going on in the Bermuda Triangle?
- |
  

- Homicidal whales.
- |
  

- The probing?
- |
  

- Do you really think that the only diagnostic tool available to beings that have traveled across the galaxy must be inserted anally?
- |
  

- Please.
- What you do have to worry about is that aliens are smart, much smarter than you.
- |
  

- There are dumb aliens, but they, like you, are stuck on their home planets.
- |
  

- The ones you have to worry about are the ones that showed up on your, formerly our, planet.
- |
  

- Because, believe me, they didn't show up just to say whatup.
- |
  

- They want things.
- |
  

- What kind of things, I don't know.
- |
  

- I would assume brains.
- |
  

- It would have been nice if the aliens were friendly.
- |
  

- But that's not going to happen.
- |
  

- They want something.
- And it's in your interest to make sure they don't get it.
- |
  

- How?
- |
  

- Going for it!
- |
  

- Don't forget a ragtag group of rural high-school kids who beat back the Soviet war machine.
- |
  

- Sure,  Red Dawn  was a movie, but when the aliens come it will be a super-inspiring movie.
- |
  

- Earth has never been a planet of quitters.
- |
  

- Sure, the majority of you are quitters, but don't forget that small percentage of zealots and idiots.
- |
  

- They might have some things to say to those aliens.
- |
  

- Probably crazy things.
- Anyway, remember that if science has proven anything it's that all corporeal beings are subject to one of four forces.
- |
  

- Those forces are a metal softball bat, a pitchfork, a bucket of boiling water, and a Frisbee with razorblades taped to the edges.
- |
  

- So, again, I beseech you to turn it up a notch.
- |
  

- Heck, turn it up two notches.
- What if you lose?
- |
  

- Well, I hope it doesn't come as a surprise that you are going to lose, and lose badly.
- |
  

- Why fight?
- |
  

- If nothing else, it would answer the question "What if we had fought back against the aliens?
- Plus, you could avenge my untimely death.
- When you're rolled up in the fetal position, just know that not all is lost.
- |
  

- Even if all is currently on fire.
- |
  

- What I'm trying to tell you is that every bathtub has its scum, and the same goes for galaxies.
- "After getting beat down by the aliens, Earth would be in the perfect position to become a\x97if not \"the\"\x97planet of interplanetary lowlifes. A wonderfully diverse intergalactic melting pot of smugglers, pirates, chronic masturbators, and stowaways. Because you know who will be laughing when you beat the aliens at three-card space monte? You. Just make sure you do it quietly. And while you're conning aliens out of their hard-earned alien pension funds, you might start wondering who really won."
- Obviously, that would still be the aliens.
