  Ahoy Dean Bonny:\n\
  This missive is intended to officially protest certain statements ye made recently in an interview given to the  Journal of International Buccaneering  ( J.I.B. ) during the doldrums of this year. While I was captivated by your insightful analysis of the effects of Monsoon season on Indonesian pillaging returns, which, as always, was a refreshingly cogent discussion of contemporary Macropiratic theory, your skullduggerous slandering (below) of the First Mate's Institute of Technology was inexplicably antagonistic as well as plainly inaccurate:\n\n  J.I.B. : Has there been any progress with respect to a matey-exchange program with the First Mate\xB9s Institute of Technology?\n\
