  READ  PART ONE
  The manufacturer of a well-known make of oil burner asked me to give a talk to his salesmen and see if I could suggest anything to improve their selling technique. I opened my talking with a question: "Can any of you tell me the ten selling points of your oil burner?" No one&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;not even the sales manager&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;could oblige. They carried all kinds of literature explaining these ten points in detail, and admitted they had tried to memorize them. Yet frequently they would forget from three to six of them when a customer confronted them.
  I asked the sales manager to get his list of sales points and read them through to me once. I knew them cold in five minutes. The Mental Filing System had helped me do in that brief period what the salesmen had been unable to learn in several months.
  This is how I hooked the sales points on to the key words so the salesmen could present their argument smoothly and in correct order:
  1.
  Dependable  (alarm clock). Nothing is more  dependable  than your  alarm clock . You  depend  on your  alarm clock  to keep accurate time and you  depend  on it to go off at the time set. Good old  dependable alarm clock . The oil heater is as  dependable  as an  alarm clock .
  2.
  Economical  (trousers). You keep all your money&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;all your  economic  wealth&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;in your  trousers  pockets. You have only one pair of  trousers  because you are  economical,  and your tailor cut them to be  economical  with material. They are  economical trousers .
  3.
  Continuous hot water  (chair).  Hot water  runs  continuously  over the  chair . A spigot is attached to the  chair , and the  water  is so  hot  the  chair  is  continuously  bathed in clouds of steam. When you sit on this  chair  you are in  continuous hot water .
  4.
  Trouble-free  (table). There is no  trouble  to this  table  at all. You can take it apart and put it together without  trouble . It's a  trouble-free table . See a big smiling face painted on the  table  top. The  table  is  trouble-free , just like the oil burner.
  5.
  Even temperature  (newspaper). The weather report in this  newspaper  says, "Tomorrow:  Even temperature ." See a thermometer lying on the  newspaper  with the mercury always at 72 degrees, an  even temperature .
  6.
  Clean  (automobile). Picture a spotlessly c lean  white  automobile.  You are washing the  automobile  so  clean  that it shines. The  automobile , like the oil burner, is  clean .
  7.
  Safe  (policeman). The  policeman  is the symbol of  safety . He is sitting on a  safe , keeping things  safe  for you. He holds up a sign, SAFETY. Or you see the  policeman  playing baseball and he slides into home plate&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;he's  safe .
  8.
  Long life  (revolving door). The  revolving door  is lying on its side, and it looks very  long . Inside the  revolving door  are stacked piles of  life -insurance policies printed with large letters LONG LIFE. The  revolving door  itself is made out of four giant-size red copies of  Life  magazine.
  9.
  Compact  (mailbox). Your  mailbox  is very  compact . Your open up your  mailbox  and a cloud of powder envelops you from a lady's open  compact . Your  mailbox  is packed with  compacts .
  10.
