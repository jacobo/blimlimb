- "Q: You participated in a brain study last spring."
- "Rose Gowen: Yes, that is correct."
- "Q: How did that come about?"
- "Gowen: Well, I was working as a temp at the time."
- "Q: The temp agency sent you?"
- "Gowen: No, of course not, the temp agency sent me to insurance companies to make photocopies."
- |
  

- No, I was working as a temp, but in the spring, assignments were few and far between &#151; I don't know why, as I'm pretty good at making photocopies &#151; but anyhow, I needed money.
- |
  

- A friend of mine's cousin is some kind of brain researcher, and she works at an Institute for brain study.
- "Q: What's the name of the Institute?"
- "Gowen: I don't remember, and it's just as well, because I didn't ask if it was okay if I talked about it."
- |
  

- I didn't sign anything that said I wouldn't.
- "Q: I didn't ask if I could write about it either."
- |
  

- Let's continue.
- "Gowen: So my friend said his cousin was always looking for test subjects."
- |
  

- And it paid ten bucks an hour.
- "Q: That's not that much."
- "Gowen: It's more than nothing."
- |
  

- Which is what I was making sitting at home.
- |
  

- And I thought it would be interesting.
- "Q: Okay, so you signed up."
- |
  

- Were you excited?
- |
  

- Nervous?
- "Gowen: Yeah, both."
- |
  

- I was going to get a ride to the place with my friend's cousin; the night before, I had trouble sleeping.
- |
  

- In the morning, on the subway into Manhattan, I took some notes about what I was thinking, but I lost the notebook.
- "Q: Oh!"
- "Gowen: But I remember, I was thinking, \"What if they discover I have an  amazing  brain?"
- "Q: (laughter)"
- "Gowen: I mean, why not?"
- |
  

- There could be something rare and special about my brain.
- "Q: (laughing) Sure."
- |
  

- Why not?
- "Gowen: A few years ago &#151; maybe this is too intimate to share, but who cares &#151; a few years ago, during a pelvic exam, I learned that my uterus is unusual &#151; it's tilted, or something, I forget &#151; anyhow, something about my uterus (or maybe it was my cervix?"
- |
  

- And, perversely, that makes me feel special.
- "Q: Okay."
- "Gowen: So I was thinking, maybe there's something unusual about my brain, too."
- |
  

- Maybe I have an extra bump somewhere or something.
- |
  

- "I was riding the subway having this fantasy: one of the brain researchers would say, \"Wow!"
- "\" He or she would call a colleague over, and say, \""
- Hey, check this extra bump out!
- |
  

- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- "Q: (laughter)"
- "Gowen: But then, I was also considering the possibility that they would discover that my brain was ravaged by a tumor, or some kind of degenerative disease, and they would say, \"It's amazing you're able to function at all!"
- "Q: So interesting subway ride, hmm?"
- "Gowen: Yeah."
- |
  

- I met my friend's cousin at her apartment, and she drove us to the Institute.
- |
  

- She was nice.
- |
  

- I tried to make conversation about an article I read in  The New Yorker  about whether or not the brain regenerates.
- |
  

- I kept forgetting the vocab, though.
- |
  

- It was kind of silly, but then we got to the place.
- "Q: At this point did you know what you would be doing, and what the study was about?"
- "Gowen: No. I was so absorbed in the idea that my brain might be unusual, that I didn't even ask!"
- |
  

- But when we went into the building, and walked down the hall to the room where the study was going to take place.
- |
  

- The walls were lined with posters about schizophrenia and perception.
- "Q: What did you think about that?"
- "Gowen: I thought it was interesting."
- "Q: Did you think maybe they would find that you were schizophrenic?"
- "Gowen: What?"
- "Q: Well, did it occur to you that though you thought you were volunteering for the study, perhaps some personality that you are not aware of is a patient of a psychiatrist who signed you up for the study?"
- "Gowen: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard."
- "Q: You didn't even think of that?"
- "Gowen: No."
- "Q: Well, remember what P.G."
- |
  

- "Wodehouse said: \"Never confuse the impossible with the implausible."
- "Gowen: I think you've got that quote wrong."
- |
  

- I think it's "Never confuse the impossible with the unlikely.
- "Q: Okay."
- |
  

- Whatever it is, let's get back to the story.
- |
  

- So you got to the Institute and saw the posters about schizophrenia.
- |
  

- Then what?
- "Gowen: I was introduced to the other researchers, and I signed a thing saying I agreed to be paid, and filled out a questionnaire about whether I was right- or left- handed, footed, eyed, and so on."
- "Q: Which are you?"
- "Gowen: Righty all the way."
- |
  

- And then they stuck electrodes on my head, and I did the tests, and went home.
- "Q: Tell me about the electrodes."
- "Gowen: I felt like I was at a hair salon."
- |
  

- I never go to a hair salon in real life, but I was sitting in a vinyl armchair, reading about Uma Thurman in an InStyle, while a young man and a young woman attached the electrodes.
- |
  

- There was a blue cloth cap, which they put on my head and fastened under my chin with a chinstrap.
- |
  

- Some of the electrodes dangled from the front; they attached those ones first, by squirting a saline solution on my forehead and temples, and taping them on, and the rest were stuck through grommets on the cap.
- |
  

- Someone described getting their hair highlighted to me once &#151; they put a cap on your head, and pull bits of your hair though holes in it with a crochet hook &#151; it was a lot like that.
- |
  

- They had blunt-tipped syringes, with which they rooted around in my scalp, and squirted the saline solution with (the saline looked like semi-solid grease), and then they stuck the electrodes in.
- |
  

- It took a while; I think there were 132 electrodes.
- "Q: Then what?"
- "Gowen: Then, for the rest of the day, except lunch, I was tested."
- "Q: Were there other test subjects there as well?"
- "Gowen: No. They do one at a time."
- "Q: What was the testing like?"
- "Gowen: The wires from the electrodes came off my head, and were gathered together in rainbow bands &#151; you know those rainbow bands of wires?"
- |
  

- So I was in a small room, almost a closet, sitting in the armchair in front of a computer screen.
- |
  

- The rainbow bands were hooked up to a computer behind my chair, and I was given an indicator button &#151; just a little box with a button on it, that was hooked up to the computer.
- |
  

- Each test lasted about twenty minutes, I think.
- |
  

- During the tests, a square of color would flash on the screen, and then a pair of letters and numbers.
- |
  

- Depending on what color flashed on the screen, I had to push the button if either the number was even, or the letter was a vowel.
- |
  

- So, like if the color was pink, I was supposed to look for vowels, and if it was purple I was supposed to look for even numbers.
- |
  

- For instance if the screen flashed purple, and then A7 came up, I wouldn't press the button, but if it was A6, I would, or if it was pink and A7, I would.
- |
  

- "It was very quick: click, click, click, for about twenty minutes, and then I would rest before the next one."
- "Q: Was it hard?"
- "Gowen: Well, at first I was second-guessing myself &#151; I'd think, I  think  that was a click, but maybe it was really purple, not pink."
- |
  

- I was sort of mentally reciting, pink-vowel-yes, purple-odd-no, and at the end I had it down, and it was just yes or no.
- "Q: How'd you do?"
- "Gowen: I thought I was doing pretty well, and the people who were running the test from the computer on the other side of the door to the closet where I was sitting, kept saying I was doing well &#151; but I found out later from my friend, who did the test too, that they always say you're doing well, partly to keep the subject from falling asleep."
- |
  

- It was pretty hypnotic.
- |
  

- But then at lunchtime, one of the other researchers, who was watching the test from another room, told me he had to check the program because I wasn't missing any.
- "Q: You're grinning."
- "Gowen: Yeah."
- |
  

- I felt pretty pleased with myself that I was doing well, until later when I was on my way home, and realized that the test had nothing to do with intelligence or anything, it was more about alertness and reflexes and perception.
- |
  

- So there was no reason to feel smug.
- "Q: You look kind of smug, though."
- "Gowen: I know, but it's misplaced smugness."
- |
  

- The other thing they kept telling me, during the tests &#151; aside from, "You're doing really well" &#151; was, Relax your forehead. They were in the other room, they couldn't see me, so when they said, Relax your forehead, I thought, "Oh my god, if they can tell what my forehead is doing what else can they tell?
- "\" Because they were watching my answers on the test, but they were also looking at my brainwaves."
- |
  

- And everything that happened in my head or body would show up in the brainwaves, right?
- |
  

- So at one point, I was doing the test, and there were a bunch of researchers in the other room talking.
- |
  

- I was doing the test, trying to eavesdrop on the conversation in the next room, thinking about my itchy foot, and thinking about how I might describe the experience to my boyfriend later &#151; and wondering if the brain researchers could tell, and if they were impressed that I was doing all those things at once.
- "Q: Could they?"
- "Gowen: I don't know, they didn't mention it."
- |
  

- But then after lunch, my chicken wrap was digesting in a..
- |
  

- I couldn't help wondering whether they knew and would recognize the brainwave pattern for the opening and closing of the sphincter.
- "Q: Reminds me of that song \"I Saw An X-Ray of a Girl Passing Gas."
- "Gowen: Exactly."
- "Q: So did you find out if you have an amazing or unusual brain?"
- "Gowen: No. But my friend's cousin said I had beautiful brainwaves."
- "Q: Do you think you learned anything through this experience?"
- "Gowen: I learned that I am even vainer than I thought, and that I should not scorn videogames &#151; I might be good at them."
