- If I had something to write about, it would be funny.

- Like knee-slapping,  call-up-your-friends-and- read-it-to-their-answering-machines,  life-is-so-LIKE-that funny.

- Or maybe it wouldn't be knee-slapping funny, but  a few people would read it into answering machines.
- It would have a coherent narrative and an easy, witty cadence, but one that  would require some effort to assimilate to.

- Sometimes you would have to turn  back a page to completely get the really important thing that references the  seemingly less important thing from a while back.
- The structure would be original enough that it would stand out (like 2nd  person narrative, or divined stream-of-consciousness or footnotes that make  you cringe at their cleverness and the annoyance of having to read them  because they are all so damn brilliant), yet traditional enough to evoke many  early 20th century classics.
- |
  

- Whatever it would be, someone would describe it  as like something else on steroids or crack or speed.
- I would use the word noumenon, which I heard someone use in conversation the  other day, incorrectly supposing it had something to do with the character of  the mailman on Seinfeld.
- |
  

- I would end sentences with prepositions and assign  commas wantonly.
- |
  

- If I had something to write about, it would acknowledge the  universal decline of morality, the ascent of reckless prurience, and the  centrality of family as a force to be reckoned with.
- |
  

- It would speak  reverently of holidays, of home-cooked food, and the empty feeling one gets  when eating leftovers alone.
- As a gentle aside, it would condemn capitalism, but not from a Marxist   standpoint.
- If I had something to write about, it would have authority figures who abuse  their authority, victims who manipulate others with their pain, children who  speak wisely but out of turn and are therefore largely ignored, teenagers who  make foolish and deadly decisions, liars of the most obvious sort  (politicians, lawyers, talk show hosts, whatever), a naive soul who makes a  whimsical choice that ends up affecting thousands of lives for better or for  worse, I don't know which yet, and a Fuller Brush salesman either full of  bile or leaky optimism.
- If I had something to write about, it would speak longingly of Vermont in  winter, at that very moment before the first snowflake floats gently,  indifferently, to the clenched earth and you can't help but anthropomorphize  autumn in your mind as it slinks away like a rejected party guest.
- It would be short enough to read before going to bed but long enough that it  couldn't be read in one bathroom sitting.
- |
  

- It might be accompanied by a line  drawing, but not by me, since I've never been able to capture the symbolic  essence of anything.
- It would have a title, but it would not be taken directly from the piece  itself.
- |
  

- It would be fiction without being a fictionalized memoir, although  the characters would be embellished from people I like to think I know.
- |
  

- It  might possibly have a defrocked homosexual virgin priest with my cousin  Patrick as the thinly veiled model, which would really piss off my mother  because she hates it when I suggest that Patrick is hiding from his  intrinsically divergent sexuality in the clergy.
- |
  

- Maybe if I merged him with  the Fuller Brush salesman my mother wouldn't notice the similarity to  Patrick.
- I would use a pseudonym and to hell with my mother.
- If I had something to write about, it would lead an author of moderate   influence to drop me a kind, electric-typewritten note on 100% cotton bond  paper with the PEN insignia at the top saying that he liked my work, and I  would call him and thank him for it and we would meet at the Yale Club for a  drink where he would put his hand on my knee underneath the table over his  second martini and I would flee not because I wouldn't want to have a fling  with a married, significantly older published author, but because I hadn't  shaved my legs in weeks.
- |
  

- Or maybe not; maybe we would retreat to some  discreet midtown hotel, hopefully the Royalton.
- |
  

- I would feel guilty either  way.
- It would be mentioned in passing by boutique bookstore employees and by a  certain female New York Times columnist over lunch with her editor, but not  in her actual column.
- It wouldn't be hailed, but it would be respected; it wouldn't be included in  an anthology, but someone might print it out and stick it in a folder labeled  "stuff.
- "\" I wouldn't get paid for it, but someone would see it who would (and  who could) pay me for the next thing I wrote, which would take me longer than  expected because I would have trouble accepting that I could write anything  worthy of getting paid for."

- I would discuss this with my shrink, who listens  to me talk all the time about wanting to be a writer, but never expresses the  slightest interest in my writing.

- I'd spring for a new, more expensive  shrink.
- I would learn a little something about myself at some point along the way,  maybe, but I would soon forget it.

  If I had something to write about, it would be funny. Like

  It would have a coherent narrative and an easy, witty cadence, but one

   would require some effort to assimilate to. Sometimes you would have

  references the
   seemingly less important thing from a while back.
  The structure would be original enough that it would stand out (like
  2nd
   person narrative, or divined stream-of-consciousness or footnotes that
  make
   you cringe at their cleverness and the annoyance of having to read
  them
