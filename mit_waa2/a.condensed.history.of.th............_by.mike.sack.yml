  Albert Gore and Bill Clinton did indeed have to threaten to blow up the Earl
  of Lancaster's manor with the stolen chalice of Surrey in order to force the
  Earl to surrender. A trial followed. Gore and Clinton were found guilty
  before the Learned Elders of Mirador, in absentia, and multiwing'd
  messengers were dispatched to notify Lord Ballentin of their escape. Upon
  hearing the news, Ballentin broke down and wept, and then ordered his
  Alliance of Six Knights to hunt down and capture our heroes. After a time,
  Ballentin began to weep again, this time for more obvious reasons.
  Dame Tina Brown and her common-law husband, Hawk-Flied McCaffrey, the Wisest
  Man in All the Land, never did capture the flying unicorn that went by the
  name of Wint'green. Instead, the couple found themselves living in a small
  hamlet, on the outskirts of the low-lying marshlands of what was then known
  as The Great Scottish-Irish Empire. Their cottage was large, their love for
  each other larger, and happiness reigned throughout the land. To this day,
  no one has ever located the Stassy Sapphire.
  Lady Liddy Dole was playing her magical spinet upon being informed that
  Babraum, the half-elf manchild to whom she had most willingly given up her
  youth, had been hanged for his minor part in the fabled Shallow-Steppe
  Uprising of the Long Winter. She stopped playing. The room was eerily quiet.
  After a short while, she stepped away from the solid-gold harpsichord and
  walked slowly down the long hallway to the Room of Flags. There she sat
  alone, awake, for the rest of the evening. In the morn, she walked slowly
  back to the spinet and resumed her melancholic playing.
  Donald Trump never did recover from the jousting competition between himself
  and the Princess of Markdale, heir to the fantastic amber fortune. Many
  years later, still deathly afraid of oak sticks and wild mares, he stood on
  the edge of the Cliffs of the Northern Sheer and, noticing that no other
  human soul was watching, placed his scarred right hand over his heart and
  stepped tentatively into the great unknown.
