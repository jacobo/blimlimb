- I set up a webcam in my bedroom so people could watch me 24/7!

- However, the more I thought about it, the more the whole thing seemed kind of creepy and demeaning.

- So I scrapped that idea.

- "From: Confidence D. Riblet"
- "Subject: engorge"
- Love life letting you down?
- Can't SATISFY your woman?
- Perhaps the two of you should sit down and discuss the issue.
