- BIRTH
- The doctor tells my mother to push while she also tells the nurse to get my father.
- |
  

- My mother has been in labor for nearly forty hours.
- |
  

- My father rushes into the room, his face a mix of pure terror and pure joy.
- |
  

- I come out, nearly dead from blood loss.
- |
  

- I appear on both Oprah and Phil Donahue, being the only person ever shot twice in the stomach while still in the womb.
- |
  

- WALKING FOR THE FIRST TIME
- I stand up on shaky, little-boy legs, and then promptly fall over, a pool of my own blood spreading out from underneath me.
- |
  

- FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL
- I walk in, nervous and scared and wishing I could go back home, and then stumble backwards, clutching my stomach.
- |
  

- "\"Aw Christ!"
- |
  

- Aw, shit!
- "\" I say as I knock over a chair, looking down as dark blood seeps from between my fingers."
- I make three new friends that day.
- |
  

- FIRST KISS
- She is the girl in my Business Tech class from school, and we have met in the recreation room of my church.
- |
  

- She is wearing some sort of fruity perfume, and her hair is tied back.
- |
  

- I lean forward, and my breath is coming in shaky little gasps.
- |
  

- Our lips touch, and then I cough twice, blood slowly leaking out of my mouth.
- |
  

- I ask her to call an ambulance, goddamnit, I've been fucking shot.
- |
  

- I sob quietly that I don't want to die here.
- |
  

- GRADUATION
- I walk across the stage, and shake the principal's hand while he hands my diploma.
- |
  

- I collapse a few steps after, and the entire auditorium where graduation is being held goes deadly quiet.
- |
  

- All you can hear is my girlish whimpering in pain, and begging for someone to just put me out of my misery, for the love of Christ.
- |
  

- FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE
- I step into my dorm, and greet my new roommate.
- |
  

- We talk for a while, learning about each other.
- |
  

- I then lurch backwards against the wall, a look of shock and pain on my face.
- |
  

- My legs buckle beneath me, and I slump to the ground, my eyes staring off into nothing, but suddenly I don't look to be in pain.
- |
  

- I look peaceful and almost happy, and I whisper, right before I go, "It's not the end, is it?
- |
  

- GETTING SHOT IN THE STOMACH AT CLOSE RANGE
- This is actually pretty much the same.
