- It is always a pleasure to welcome these fine individuals to  this humble land, and let me start by apologizing for the unfortunate mishap  with their jeep.

- The facts remain a little unclear, but it would seem that a  grain of sand in the fuel line led to an unusually large engine backfire and  the vaporization of the rear half of the vehicle.

- I can't tell you how  relieved we are that the driver and passengers were thrown clear into a  nearby sand dune and suffered only minor loss of consciousness and vertebrae.
- Perhaps it was the slight disorientation of that incident that caused them to  believe they had spotted weapons-grade uranium at their first inspection  site, the Baghdad Children's Radiology and Missile Control Center.

- Their  confusion is completely understandable, and let me be the first to admit that  weapons-grade uranium does indeed look an awful lot like the toy-grade  uranium employed at this world-class pediatric institute.
- |
  

- But try using the  kid's stuff in a man-sized nuclear device and you'll see the difference.
- |
  

- Believe me!
- |
  

- I know.
- Similarly, I can see how the inspectors' relative unfamiliarity with Iraqi  conditions might cloud their perceptions of the insecticide factory they  visited on the outskirts of the capital the next day.

- But honestly, the  products of this modern facility are "weapons of mass destruction" only for  the "masses" of locusts, sand flies and cockroaches that continually threaten  the security of Iraq's borders.

- True, they are making an industrial-strength  pesticide that you wouldn't want to sprinkle on your breakfast cereal.
- |
  

- But  you should see the size of those roaches&#151;seven inches, some of them!
- |
  

- And the  Iraqi scientists who still have their tongues assure me that this compound is  safe for general use if all neighboring populations can be gently herded into  some of the deeper underground salt caverns for several years.
- As to the cache of ground-to-ground tactical nuclear missiles uncovered in a  visit to the Ali Baba Orchid Nursery, I was at a loss to account for their  presence until General Hussein himself explained the situation to me.

- Nights can be restless in the desert.

- |
  

- The bullets fired into their hats and taillights were  not "an act of blatant aggression," as alleged in the inspectors' report, but  rather a traditional Iraqi leave-taking. Ask anyone who has ever departed the  country in a hurry.

  RE: Explanation of apparent anomalies
  My Dear Kofi,
  As you may know, the forward-looking folks in the current Iraqi regime have 
  hired my firm, Pronto PR, to give their public image a facelift and help 
  smooth over some of the difficulties on their way to their rejoining the 
  cherished family of nations. Among my many pleasant duties is the welcoming 
  of official delegations from the United Nations. Following is my report on 
  the most recent such encounter. As you will see, no matter how thorny the

  I would be most remiss, not only in my own eyes but in the eyes of the world, 
  if I did not take this opportunity to clear up some of the trivial 
  misunderstandings resulting from the recent visit by the official UN weapons 
  inspection team. It is always a pleasure to welcome these fine individuals to 
  this humble land, and let me start by apologizing for the unfortunate mishap 
  with their jeep. The facts remain a little unclear, but it would seem that a 
  grain of sand in the fuel line led to an unusually large engine backfire and 
  the vaporization of the rear half of the vehicle. I can't tell you how 
  relieved we are that the driver and passengers were thrown clear into a 
  nearby sand dune and suffered only minor loss of consciousness and vertebrae.
  Perhaps it was the slight disorientation of that incident that caused them to
