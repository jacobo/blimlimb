- If you get a chance to see the episode in question -- in which I play the lesbian sister of S.J.

- "Parker\xE2s love interest, you will no doubt see Harper\xE2s rage, rage at injustice in our country and around the world, simmering just beneath the surface."
- |
  

- This year's episodes of "Sex and the City" are already in reruns now, apparently, so please look for it.
- "Q: You have also pretended to be other people on other shows."
- |
  

- Please name these instances.
- "WERTHMANN: Other fabulous television appearances include HBO's Breast Men (the dowdy \"90's Receptionist\"), Guiding Light (once as a teenage drifter; again as an ornery slacker at a rural gas station), and All My Children (coke addict in Erica's group therapy at the Betty Ford Clinic) and perhaps most embarrassingly, the dismal MTV sitcom Apartment 2-F (Catholic school girl). I tried very hard to upstage the principal actors, in hopes I would get a recurring role, no matter the vehicle, but all my efforts failed."
- "If space permits I would additionally like to explicate the theory that although all four women on \"Sex and the City\", are attractive, only two of the four stars of Sex and the City are actually sexy: Kim Cattrall, the \"slutty older one,\" and Ms. Parker, the \"columnist\" whose date's sister I played in the aforementioned episode."
- |
  

- I find Cynthia Nixon, while fantastically talented, more cerebral than sensual -- for me, a certain feral quality is SO important in a woman!
- |
  

- Kristin Davis's presence seems to me mannered and (though I hate to say it) somewhat dumb.
- |
  

- If a man wants coitus with Hello Kitty, he can always buy one of those backpacks or stationery kits.
- "Q:  If you were trapped under a building, what song would you sing?"
- "WERTHMANN: Probably \"Green Eyed Lady."
- "\"  Do you know it?"
- |
  

- I really like that song.
- "Q: What is the angriest thing you have ever held in your hands?"
- "WERTHMANN: My head."
- "Q: The interview is over."
- |
  

- I thank you.
- "WERTHMANN: I also thank you."
- "Q: You are welcome."
- "WERTHMANN: Also you."

- Are welcome.

  To commemorate this show, we have interviewed Ms. Werthmann, briefly.\n\
  Here are the highlights:\n\
  Q: During the day you work at the U.N., doing some sort of website for\n\
  kids. When you are not doing that, you often pretend to be people other\n\
  than yourself on shows on television, including a recent appearance on\n\
  \"Sex in the City,\" about which we have heard quite a \"buzz.\" My question\n\
  is, how do you square such appearances with your so-called belief in\n\
  peace for the Afganis, and what does Valerie Harper, who pretended to be\n\
  your mother on the \"Sex\xB7 City\" episode, think about this and other\n\
  things?\n\
  WERTHMANN: Valerie Harper may be my pretend mom, but she is a wonderful\n\
  woman and also a vocal activist for many human rights organizations. If\n\
  you get a chance to see the episode in question -- in which I play the\n\
  lesbian sister of S.J. Parker\xE2s love interest, you will no doubt see\n\
  Harper\xE2s rage, rage at injustice in our country and around the world,\n\
  simmering just beneath the surface. This year's episodes of \"Sex\n\
  and the City\" are already in reruns now, apparently, so please look for\n\
  it.\n\
  Q: You have also pretended to be other people on other shows. Please\n\
  name these instances.\n\
  WERTHMANN: Other fabulous television appearances include HBO's Breast\n\
  Men (the dowdy \"90's Receptionist\"), Guiding Light (once as a teenage\n\
  drifter; again as an ornery slacker at a rural gas station), and All My\n\
  Children (coke addict in Erica's group therapy at the Betty Ford Clinic)\n\
  and perhaps most embarrassingly, the dismal MTV sitcom Apartment 2-F\n\
  (Catholic school girl). I tried very hard to upstage the principal\n\
  actors,\n\
  in hopes I would get a recurring role, no matter the vehicle, but all my\n\
  efforts\n\
  failed.\n\
  If space permits I would additionally like to explicate the theory that\n\
  although\n\
  all four women on \"Sex and the City\", are attractive, only two of the\n\
  four stars\n\
  of Sex and the City are actually sexy: Kim Cattrall, the \"slutty older\n\
  one,\"\n\
  and Ms. Parker, the \"columnist\" whose date's sister I played in the\n\
  aforementioned episode. I find Cynthia Nixon, while fantastically\n\
  talented,\n\
  more cerebral than sensual -- for me, a certain feral quality is SO\n\
