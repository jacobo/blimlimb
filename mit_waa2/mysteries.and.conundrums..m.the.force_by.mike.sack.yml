  The origin of this wound shaped like a lollipop on my inner thigh.
  What is our purpose here on earth? And if that is too complicated, then something far simpler. Like, just for grins: Why are X-Treme snacks so goddamn tempting?
  The whereabouts of my Superfly Borsalino slouch hat.
  That murder of what's-his-name by the guy who escaped from that maximum-security jail, he committed a horrible crime, the details now elude me. I simply must catch him.
  This is important to me, and it's the reason that I'm now asking you this question: This bottle of cherry pop, it's been here all week. Who owns it? And this cookie? Chocolate chip? Anyone? A little help would be dynamite, thank you.
  A few years ago, there was that bank robbery. Millions of dollars was stolen, as was jewelry, gold and other valuables. A security guard was injured, as was an innocent bystander.

Or should he, after much and careful thought, become that dentist specializing in root canals? Help me, dear Lord, you are my only hope . . . you and that thick-waisted prostitute that I met a few hours ago purchasing that bucket of smelts at the illegal seafood shanty down by the docks. Perhaps she, too, could be of some help.
