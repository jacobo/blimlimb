  1. We're Back / Inkjet Printer "Joke"
  We haven't published our little newsletter for a few new tides and to the top-notch Seamen/people who missed it, I offer a heartfelt "Ahoy."

  No. Weekend. Shifts. For. A month, plus reduced hours during weekdays, and you can trade in your Shift Cap'n scarf and hat for a First Mate eye patch by the end of today&#8230; you have one new skull and crossbones in your sailing log. Congratulations.
