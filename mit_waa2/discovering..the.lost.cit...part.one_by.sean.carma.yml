- "Q: How do you detect undersea volcanic eruptions?"
- "Kelley: We're actually really lucky here in Seattle, because we've got an array &#151; called a SOSA array."
- |
  

- It's a hydro-phone array the Navy used to use to look for Russian submarines off the Pacific Northwest coast.
- |
  

- In 1993 the Navy started letting NOAA [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] review the data from the array.
- |
  

- And it turns out the listening devices in this array also pick up earthquakes.
- |
  

- So, since eruptions on the sea floor produce a very characteristic pattern of earthquake, we locate the eruptions through their signature earthquakes.
- "Q: And these earthquakes occur in places where the tectonic plates that form the ocean floor are spreading apart?"
- "Kelley: Yes."
- |
  

- The holding tanks of submarine volcanoes &#151; where the melt is stored &#151; are called magma chambers.
- |
  

- The reason submarine volcanoes &#151; or any volcano &#151; erupts is, the gasses in the melt expand.
- |
  

- And periodically melt upwells in those areas where the plates are spreading apart.
- |
  

- And if enough melt collects, there's a volcanic eruption, and that forms the top crust of the sea floor.
- "Q: I read that one kind of eruption on the ocean floor involves hydrothermal vents, these black chimneys, called \"black smokers."
- "\" How does that happen?"
- "Kelley: The heat given off from the magma chamber melt below an underwater volcano can drive the circulation of fluids beneath the seafloor."
- |
  

- When the hot fluids exit the seafloor they may form a vent.
- Another way vents form is through the residual heat in the rocks below, from the melt cooling and crystallizing.
- |
  

- So as the plates spread apart, seawater penetrates down to depths of around two to eight kilometers, where it is warmed up by the cooling melt.
- |
  

- And this creates a series of convection cells.
- |
  

- The fluids in those convection cells eventually vent onto the sea floor.
- |
  

- Those fluids are 400 degrees Celsius or so, so when they hit the two-degree seawater, all of their metals precipitate out.
- |
  

- When you see black smoke in the water column above a vent, you're seeing metals precipitating out of those venting fluids.
- |
  

- But not all the metals go into that plume of black smoke.
- |
  

- Some form the chimney itself.
- "Q: What do we know about these hydrothermal vent systems?"
- "Kelley: We have a pretty good general idea of how the systems work, but if you start looking at the details, we don't know very much (laughs)."
- |
  

- We know why volcanoes erupt.
- |
  

- We know how often you might expect an eruption on the sea floor.
- |
  

- We've actually never seen an eruption on the floor.
- |
  

- Even though we've been going out there for &#151; what, 100 years or more?
- |
  

- "Q: At the end of 2000 you found a type of undersea hydrothermal vent that no one had ever seen before."
- |
  

- What was that?
- "Kelley: We found a new kind of hydrothermal vent that we believe forms from circulation of fluids in deep rocks, called peridotites, that underlie submarine magma chambers."
- |
  

- In certain places in the Mid-Atlantic ridge, there can be 50,000 to 100,000 years between volcanic events.
- |
  

- But the plates are always spreading apart.
- |
  

- So when they do finally rupture, very large faults form, through processes that we don't fully understand.
- |
  

- But those faults end up stripping off the top, say, eight kilometers of rock on the ocean floor.
- |
  

- That exposes very deep underlying rocks that have a very different chemistry, and that are chemically unstable on the sea floor.
- |
  

- The interaction of seawater with the unstable peridotites generates heat.
- |
  

- So it's a very different process than the generation of heat from cooling of a magma chamber.
- |
  

- This is a chemical reaction that's generating the heat.
- "Q: So the heat comes from a chemical reaction between seawater and these unique rocks that usually reside at such great depth?"
- "Kelley: Right."
- "Q: And when the heat from this reaction drives fluid circulation, the fluids venting on the seafloor form a different type of structure?"
- "Kelley: Yes."
- |
  

- Because the peridotite rocks have a unique chemistry, the warm fluids that interact with them also have a different chemistry than typical black smokers.
- |
  

- When the warm fluids mix with seawater, calcium carbonate crystallizes out of the seawater and forms limestone.
- |
  

- So these towers that we discovered are basically made from the same elements that form limestone, the limestone formations you see in caves.
- "Q: And what do they look like?"
- "Kelley: They are very steep-sided pinnacles rising from the ocean floor."
- |
  

- They look like the skyscrapers of an underwater limestone city.
- |
  

- We called it "the Lost City.
- "\" One was 180 feet tall."
- |
  

- That's the largest hydrothermal vent structure ever found.
- |
  

- Previously, the tallest known hydrothermal vent was a black smoker called "
- Godzilla.
- "\" That one was forty-five to fifty meters tall (about 150 feet)."
- |
  

- So these things can get quite large.
- "Q: How did you happen to find the Lost City hydrothermal vents?"
- "Kelley: Well, one characteristic feature of the mid-Atlantic ridge is these very large mountains, sort of the size of Mt."
- |
  

- Rainier, about 14,000 feet tall.
- |
  

- And they form through this faulting activity that we don't quite understand.
- |
  

- Our group was out there trying to figure out how these mountains form.
- During the days we would go down in a three-person submarine, called Alvin.
- |
  

- At night we would do camera surveys with a deep-sea camera system connected to the ship by a fiber-optic cable.
- |
  

- At night we took remote video and electronic still images.
- |
  

- And one night we just happened to come across &#151;
- "Q: These structures?"
- "Kelley: Yes, one of these."
- |
  

- I was actually in my cabin at the time, and my friend Gretchen came running in saying, "I think we found something here that doesn't look like anything we've seen before.
- "\" And then there was just a lot of excitement and craziness all that night on the ship."
- |
  

- We basically spent all that night, Jeff Karson and I and the whole group, looking at these vents.
- "Q: Had hydrothermal vents of this type ever been discovered before?"
- "Kelley: No. We knew of some carbonate chimneys on the margin of the U.S."
- |
  

- Nothing in this kind of environment, or this tall.
- "Q: How long did it take them to form?"
- "Kelley: We don't know."
- |
  

- We don't even know how long black smokers take to form.
- |
  

- Unlike black smokers, which are hosted on the youngest and hottest rocks on the planet, these carbonate vents are on rocks that are a million to a million and a half years old.
- |
  

- But we don't have a good idea how old the carbonate chimneys are.
- "Q: What's it like going down in Alvin the submarine to investigate the underwater mountain."
- "Kelley: It's always exciting."
- |
  

- I would drop anything and jump in whenever I could.
- |
  

- You start off in this really beautiful light blue water.
- |
  

- Then as you drop down, it's almost like a sci-fi movie, like you're going through the stars.
- |
  

- You see these little organisms and chains and weird shapes floating by the window as the submarine descends.
- |
  

- They're bioluminescent &#151; they glow in the dark.
- |
  

- Then about 300 feet off the bottom they turn the lights on outside the sub.
- |
  

- It's a very different experience.
- "Q: Is the submarine uncomfortable?"
- "Kelley: Kind of."
- |
  

- It's a small titanium sphere, about six feet across.
- |
  

- The whole back end is filled with electronic gear.
- |
  

- The pilot looks out the front view port, and there's two side view ports, for the scientists, which are a few inches off the floor.
- |
  

- So you're in a fetal position for eight hours or so.
- |
  

- All the light are off.
- "Q: Do you at least get a pad to sit on?"
- "Kelley: There's a little black pad to sit on."
- |
  

- You drop down through the water and you're sitting in a metal ball, right?
- |
  

- In the Atlantic Ridge the seawater might be almost freezing by the time you get to the bottom.
- |
  

- So there's a lot of condensation and it's kind of damp in there.
- |
  

- And it's incredibly busy.
- |
  

- One analogy is if you crammed three people in the front of a Volkswagen Bug and went up to the Cascades at night without a map, and just drove around with a flashlight and tried to figure out where you were &#151; that's kind of what it's like.
- |
  

- In some places, where the topography is very steep, you don't have very good navigation, you're kind of feeling your way around.
- |
  

- The visibility is maybe thirty feet.
- "Q: You can see out of this thing?"
- "Kelley: Yes, there are lights on the front of the sub."
- "Q: And it has windows?"
- "Kelley: It has viewports of maybe six to eight inches across."
- |
  

- You see out.
- |
  

- The scientists on the side can't see out front, and the pilot, in front, can't see out the side.
- |
  

- So there's lots of talking.
- |
  

- You know, "What do you see, what do you see?
- "\" There are probably eight cameras going continuously."
- |
  

- So we're changing tapes out, taking pictures.
- |
  

- You're continually talking into a microphone to take notes, trying to figure where you are and describing what you are seeing.
- |
  

- Particularly in a new area &#151; like where we discovered the Lost City, and later went down in person &#151; there's a lot of anxiousness and excitement.
- |
  

- We knew we only had one dive to see the Lost City in person, that was all we were going to get.
- |
  

- It's just an absolutely intense time.
- |
  

- Surprisingly, though, almost everyone I know falls asleep on the way up.
- |
  

- You just curl up in a blanket (laughs).
- "Q: Because the excitement is so exhausting?"
- "Kelley: Yes!"
- |
  

- You don't realize it at the time.
- |
  

- If anyone had ever told me I would fall asleep inside the submarine, but yeah.
- |
  

- "\"Oh, I have to get back down again!"
- "Q: Can you hear any sounds?"
- "Kelley: There's a lot of sound inside the submarine."
- |
  

- There are a whole bunch of sonar systems, so it's kind of like the old fashioned war movies, you know, where you hear these echoes, this pinging going on.
- "Q: I was going to ask if it compares to those scenes in \"Das Boot."
- "Kelley: It's certainly not the intensity of that (laughs)."
- |
  

- We're not worried about getting bombed or anything.
- |
  

- But it is intense in a different way, you know, in the very best way of doing science.
- |
  

- That's the intensity that you have down there.
