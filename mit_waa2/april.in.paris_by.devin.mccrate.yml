  NARRATOR
  It was April in Paris, and a young man was
  walking through the park.  The young man was very
  happy.  Earlier in the day it had rained, but now the
  sun was out and the air was warm.  Everyone was
  outside enjoying the weather.  The young man was
  thinking about springtime, and girls, and about his
  studies at the art school.  He was very happy indeed.
  [The Young Man walks past a BEAR, which sits on a park
  
  bench.  The Bear is weeping.]
  NARRATOR
  But then the young man saw a bear.  The bear
  was sitting on a park bench, crying as if its heart
  would break.  The young man could not bear to see a
  creature in so much pain, so he spoke to the bear.
  YOUNG MAN
  Bear!  Bear!  Why are you crying?  It is a
  beautiful day.
  BEAR
  I know,
  NARRATOR
  The bear said,
  BEAR
  I know.  But I feel as though my heart must
  break.

  To bring you such sorrow on the first warm

  BEAR
  I went to the caf&eacute; this morning,
  NARRATOR
  The bear said,
  BEAR
  As I often do.  It was raining outside, but the
  coffee was good and I was happy.  I saw a girl in the
  caf&eacute;.  She was very beautiful, but she was sitting
  alone.  She was crying, as I was when you found me
  here.

  first, so great was her sorrow.  Finally, she told me
  that she was waiting for a young man.  She loved the
  young man, and she thought that he loved her.  "So why
  do you weep?" I asked, and the girl began to cry
  again.  She had been waiting in the caf&eacute; for hours,
  and the young man had not come.  "I am sure the young
  man will come," I said.  "He is probably just running
  late."  "No," the girl said, "I know something has
  happened.  He will never come.  He has fallen in love
  with another girl.  He is tall, and handsome, and
  wears a flower in his lapel.  Any girl might fall in
  love with him."
