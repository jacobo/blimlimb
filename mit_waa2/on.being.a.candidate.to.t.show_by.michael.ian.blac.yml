- Culturally aware Americans are no doubt aware that a certain late-night talk show is currently seeking a new host.
- |
  

- Because I am a candidate for this position and because I do not want to jeopardize my chances of getting the job, I will not say which network the show is on, but I will give you a hint.
- |
  

- Its initials are CBS.
- Perhaps you too would like to be considered for this job.
- |
  

- Keep dreaming, sucker.
- |
  

- You've got a better chance of being crowned King of Siam.
- |
  

- And just for the record&#8212;SIAM DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANYMORE.
- |
  

- The truth is, there are very few people qualified for this job.
- |
  

- For one thing, you have to be a celebrity.
- |
  

- Fortunately, I am (very famous).
- |
  

- Also, you've got to know everything about everything.
- |
  

- Luckily, I do.
- |
  

- For example, I was the guy who informed you that Siam doesn't exist anymore.
- |
  

- Now it's some other country whose name I do not know.
- "On top of all of that, you have to be able to carry on witty banter with all kinds of people: soap-opera actresses, precocious children, British people (the worst)."
- |
  

- Again, this is not a problem for me.
- |
  

- I am well-known for being a sparkling conversationalist in the tradition of Dorothy Parker, who I am told said some truly fucked-up shit.
- |
  

- "Here is an example of a witty conversation I might have with a young starlet:"
- "Me: So what did you do on your time off this year?"
- "Gorgeous Starlet who has a Barely Concealed Crush on the Host: I went to St."
- |
  

- "Bart's, relaxed by the pool, and drank pi\xF1a coladas."
- "Me: Sounds terrible."
- |
  

- Big laugh.
- |
  

- The other thing is, you have to appeal to the demographic that watches these shows, namely the unemployed and the chronically drunk.
- |
  

- These are my people; I know this because I once commissioned a scientific study to gauge audience response to my work.
- |
  

- Two groups watched tapes of me performing my patented esoteric, self-aggrandizing brand of comedy.
- |
  

- The first group watched in the middle of the afternoon and found me "tiresome," "cringe-inducing," and "most likely gay." The second group watched the same tape in the middle of the night after being administered a large cocktail consisting of equal parts vodka, gin, and Robitussin cough syrup.
- |
  

- Those still conscious at the conclusion of the viewing found me "pretty funny," "stupid but, like, good stupid, you know?
- "\" and \""
- |
  

- In late September, I did a brief stint guest-hosting this talk show for two nights.
- |
  

- Needless to say, I looked great.
- |
  

- New suit, new haircut, and the kind of tan you can only buy for $6 at CVS.
- |
  

- Was I good?
- |
  

- Obviously, I am not the best person to give an objective critique of my own performance, but on a scale of one to 10, I would say I was about a 300 million.
- |
  

- Yes, I was good.
- |
  

- So good, in fact, that after the shows, an extremely high-powered executive's assistant approached me and said, "Nice job.
- "\" Now that may not sound like the highest praise in the world, but when you consider the fact this guy actually  stopped eating his sandwich  for a second to say it, I think you begin to sense the magnitude of the network's enthusiasm."
- Some astute people have asked me if I even want the job.
- |
  

- After all, it's a lot of hard work.
- |
  

- A new show has to be booked, written, and performed every night, five nights a week, 46 weeks a year.
- |
  

- Obviously, this kind of time commitment will severely curtail all the charity work I do with various casinos.
- But I believe that it's worth it.
- Because, at the end of the day, I believe telling topical jokes and interviewing C-level celebrities is a higher calling.
- |
  

- If this were the Middle Ages, talk-show hosts would be the priests, their guests the penitents.
- |
  

- Or not.
- |
  

- I don't know.
- |
  

- Regardless, it's a hell of a lot better than what I'm currently doing, which is expounding on the cultural significance of  The A-Team  for VH1.
- |
  

- When they asked me for my occupation on my income tax return this year, I wrote down "Fundit," and almost collapsed from depression.)
- But those aren't the primary reasons I want the job.
- No, the main reason should be obvious to anybody who knows anything about late-night-talk-show hosts&#8212;those guys are fucking rich.
- |
  

- And while being famous is great, being famous without being correspondingly wealthy is a lot like being a really hot nun.
- |
  

- Totally pointless.
- So if you see my name in lights around the first of the year, you will know I got my wish.
- |
  

- If not, look for me on VH1 making snide remarks about whoever they do get.
- |
  

- But you will know that I was once very close to being crowned the King of Siam.
