  Enter Brandysnatch and Quiver.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bran.  'Twas never a whore in Halston but a ripe ditty would have her swived aright with tuppence in to chime against her heel!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiv.  'Tis spoke aright, I trow, tho' John o' hops be spry upon thee.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bran.  No welkin i' th' tide was tossed as she by me, for all her feckless prattle of calm became her. Bless her though: her charms were quaint.
  Flourish within.   
  But of this matter, more anon, friend  Quiver . His majesty, the  King , upon his litter doth approach, serene as Jove pronouncing "gin" at cards, and girt with the kirtle of England's might.
  Enter Edward.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiv.  But soft, good  Brandysnatch . He speaks.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed.  Inasmuch as duty doth compel our candour,  
  And insofar as our late counsellor,  
  Lord  Suffix  hath with lothly, dastard spite  
  Betrayed our bold designs on preening  France ,  
  We speak now that which heretofore was heard  
  But in the glozings of our discrete Court.  
  Yet ere we pass to these concerns which strike  
  To England's heart, and to the hearts of all  
  Who are as England's bone, and England's sinew,  
  Attend first to a most amusing tale  
  Borne back to us by memory this day 
  As we were borne here on our royal way.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bran.  My liege would treat of the Rabbi and the Nun!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiv.  Or of the mule whose wit did drub a steed! 'Tis a good fellow, our King  Ted , and as I breathe, were it not treason so to fancy, marry, I'd have my King above all other jesters in the land. 'S well, my liege doth deign to speak again.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed.  Now entertain conjecture of a locust 
  Which entereth into a publick house.  
  He beckons forth the goodly, smiling tapster,  
  Who, feigning to descry an ancient friend,  
  Bestirs his nod with words that freight good cheer:  
  "Sir," quotha, "knowest not a draught we serve,  
  (A cunning mix of potions various)  
  Is called&#151;aye, oft!&#151;and by thy very name?"  
  The locust replieth, with tokens of wonder,  
  "Thou hast a drink beknownst to all as Clarence?"
  Rimshots within.
