- "True story: Blaise Pascal was a freak."

- Take that as good or bad, I offer no judgment.

- It's out there, I'm just saying, and the inner workings of his family couldn't've helped.
- |
  

- A 17th-century French math whiz, he also took time to philosophize, discover atmospheric pressure&#8212;he's the one they named that unit of pressure, the Pascal, after&#8212;and do some heavy theological work&#8212;he's also the eponym of Pascal's Wager, that thing about why it makes sense to believe in God.

- The guy died youngish, at 39.
- |
  

- At least once, he scammed his brother-in-law into lugging an inverted tube of toxic mercury up a mountain.
- |
  

- And his sisters&#8212;I don't know where to start with them.
- So let's face it, he was sickly and depressed.
- |
  

- DSM-criteria depressed.
- |
  

- "True story two: At the age of 2, they thought his brain was too large for his skull, explaining the headaches, the mysterious spells, and that weird fontanel above his left eye."
- |
  

- Turns out it was rickets, not big-brain.
- |
  

- But that's quibbling.
- |
  

- He had father issues, we know that.
- |
  

- It's just standard fare anymore.
- |
  

- And yes, he had mother issues too.
- |
  

- Weaning was a big deal, very traumatic, especially with the wet nurse still tag-teaming.
- |
  

- We're saying now it's explained by attachment theory, but in 17th-century Paris, who knew?
- |
  

- Home life was grounds for depression, is the point.
- And thus by way of set up.
- Childhood moves ahead.
- |
  

- It's the 1630s.
- |
  

- Pascal's 12 and already some kind of genius.
- |
  

- By then, mom's dead, father's working for the Feds, and one of his two sisters is devoted to him.

- "He told her his crippling \"chronic pain\" began when she got married, which I think was just a nice wedding day touch.) True (true-ish) story three: Dad walks in on Pascal drawing circles and triangles with charcoal. Dad says, \"Hey, guy, what's going on here?"
- "\" Li'l P says, \""
- Just working through the 30-second proposition of Euclid's Book One.
- "\" Dad turns to the door with an eye roll, a Gallic  hrruh hrruh , and that glint of confused half-disappointment, half-pride that parents are wont to have."
- |
  

- "\"Whatever."
- |
  

- But franks and quiche for dinner, make sure to wash your hands.
- Skip ahead a decade.
- |
  

- The little math freak has been in and out of Paris for years.
- |
  

- On one return he invents probability theory and tries to score with Sweden's Queen Christina by sending her his new calculating machine.
- |
  

- To which we say, Nice woo, Blaise.
- |
  

- Also, he meets the elder Descartes.
- |
  

- Has a snack.
- |
  

- Mail-orders a new beret.
- |
  

- And then starts thinking about how to piss off the church on a Monday but find religion on a Tuesday at&#8212;true story four&#8212;ex actly  12:30 a.m.
- First the Monday, which is about vacuum, and which required the complicity of that everyman of everymen, the brother-in-law.
- Nature abhors a vacuum.
- |
  

- God is nature.
- |
  

- Ergo, God abhors a vacuum.
- |
  

- We don't know what the big deal is, why it's so abhorrent.
- |
  

- Hoover and Dirt Devil are multi-nationals these days and that's something.
- |
  

- But it was.
- |
  

- Abhorrent.
- |
  

- And Pascal said it existed, so he was going against the Church.
- |
  

- It was a real two birds/one stone scenario, all things considered, because you get to bojangle the pope with this vacuum talk and you get to discover atmospheric pressure at the same time.
- "Because: he had brother-in-law Perier&#8212;though they called him Ralph, I think&#8212;take a mercury tube up a mountain, the puy-de-Dome."
- |
  

- At the top, Ralph measures how far down the mercury sinks.
- |
  

- "\"But why, why, why?"
- "\" Ralph must be thinking."
- |
  

- "\"Payback for the bachelor-party incident?"
- "\" Well, no, gar\xE7on, funny as that was."
- |
  

- It proves that the atmosphere has weight.
- |
  

- The higher up you go, the less pressure, since there's less air.
- |
  

- So the mercury dip is different.
- |
  

- And here's the skinny, because when the mercury in the tube goes down (less air pressing down/in from outside the tube) because the pressure is different up there, there's a vacuum left at the top of the tube.
- |
  

- Because what's in there?
- |
  

- Nothing leaked into the tube, so what's in that empty space, but this vacuum?
- |
  

- Which Nature abhorred.
- |
  

- But Pascal confirmed existed.
- And then, alas, on to the metaphorical Tuesday, about the midnight conversion experience written down and&#8212;true story five&#8212;sewn into his jacket pocket where it remained for the rest of his years.
- |
  

- Pascal's back to moral (dare we say "family"?) values and from then on its God talk day and night. Does He exist, Mr. Passkle? You bet. How do you know? I know. But how do you know? It's what I do.
- All this while, notoriously, Pascal was a betting man&#8212;and there goes Pascal's Wager, which famously came after the flop during an all-nighter of Left Bank Hold 'Em.
- |
  

- Pot odds here gave him a 3:1 on God's existence, so you know he was all in.
- |
  

- You might as well believe because there's nil to lose and everything to gain, so things are looking good for our theological gambler.
- |
  

- It's really a fantastic way to add your fun with probability theory to a top-notch deity proof.
- But here I almost forgot the rub, which was&#8212;true story six&#8212;that Pascal's niece was miraculously (supernaturally!
- |
  

- Crown of Thorns, the thorn then in residence at his other sister's convent.
- |
  

- That's weird for a handful of reasons and casts the sisters in an even shadier light.
- |
  

- So, yeah, it's no wonder we're on the outs with France.
- |
  

- Because how do you deal with it all sans judgment?
