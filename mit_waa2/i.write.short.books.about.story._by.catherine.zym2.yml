- Before I can compose the first words about LeAnn Rimes' striking loss on Star Search or Kevin "Train" Richardson's stint as a Disney World Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, Chelsea House asks that I follow their list of Guidelines for Writers.  Some of their dictates like "number text pages continuously throughout the manuscript (not by chapter)" are standard fare.

- "Others are more specific to the youth-market genre:"
- Manuscripts should begin with an event that was a high point in the subject's life (creating a "hook" that draws the reader in), and then proceed chronologically from childhood on.
- Keep prose lively and direct.
- |
  

- Remember that your target reader is 10 to 12 years old.
- Assume that your readers have minimal background knowledge of your subject.
- |
  

- Define or identify major concepts and technical terms.
- Use as many anecdotes as possible in your narrative.
- |
  

- Avoid using fictionalized dialogue.
- Implicit in the directives is what I call the Teen Beat Rule of Disclosure.
- |
  

- Specifically, the puppy-love hearts of readers are too fragile and expectant and taboo subjects, like silicon bust-ins or Betty Ford bust-outs, have to be handled with cheerful obfuscation.

- In my previous works, I didn't dare mention that LeAnn Rimes was a virgin (at publication), or that the Backstreet Boys smoke cigarettes and make fun of their handicapped fans.

- When I asked my editor if I would be allowed to entertain the scuttlebutt, he suggested I mention it only in passing and then quickly move on to the adorably coifed Taylor Thomas's performance as the voice of Young Simba.

- If there's one thing that Ricky Martin has managed to do throughout his career, it's been to keep the details of his private life, well, private.

  EPISODE FOUR: THE RULES
  Before I can compose the first words about LeAnn Rimes'
  striking loss on Star Search or Kevin "Train" Richardson's
  stint as a Disney World Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, Chelsea
  House asks that I follow their list of Guidelines for
  Writers.  Some of their dictates like "number text pages
  continuously throughout the manuscript (not by chapter)" are
  standard fare.  Others are more specific to the youth-market
  genre:
  Manuscripts should begin with an event that was a high

  the reader in), and then proceed chronologically from
  childhood on.
  Keep prose lively and direct.  Remember that your target

  Assume that your readers have minimal background knowledge

  Use as many anecdotes as possible in your narrative.
  Avoid using fictionalized dialogue.

  Not surprisingly, Chelsea House's Guidelines for Writers are

  This pickle first arose when I was offered the Jonathan

  I got through the Taylor Thomas quandary by choosing to

  Ricky Martin's "orientation situation."  Here is what I
  wrote.
  Chapter 7: Life After La Vida
  If there's one thing that Ricky Martin has managed to do
  throughout his career, it's been to keep the details of his
  private life, well, private.  But one of the dangers of
  being a famous celebrity is facing the scrutiny of the
  public eye.  It almost comes with the territory. Ricky,
  however, still considered his personal territory off limits.
  When it came to talking about his latest single, his
  homeland, his penchant for Armani clothing, Ricky could blab
  until the cows came home.  If a reporter asked about his
  love life, Ricky went from cow to clam, closing up tighter
  than a pair of his leather pants.
  As the twentieth century drew to an end, though, interest in
  everything Ricky was just beginning.  In fact, Barbara
  Walters had chosen Ricky as one of her ten most fascinating
  people of 1999.  He appeared on her show, along with Susan
  Lucci, Governor Jesse Ventura, and Monica Lewinsky, on
  November 30, 1999.
  Barbara began by commenting to Ricky that he seemed to be
  having fun with his new status as superstar, to which Ricky
  replied, "I'm enjoying the wave.  It's what I've been
  looking for, it's part of my mission."
  Before long, Barbara did what she is famous for: asking
  tough, personal questions.  She, like the rest of America,
  wanted to know about Ricky Martin's sexuality.  There were
  rumors buzzing around, she intimated, that Ricky was
  homosexual.  Now, she told him, was his chance to set the
  record straight.
  But Ricky didn't fall into her trap.  Long ago, he had made
  up his mind not to discuss the goings on in his bedroom.
  Despite pleas from Barbara, Ricky would not kiss and tell.
  Although he has been romantically linked to Rebecca de Alba,
  a popular television host and model in Mexico City, as well
  as Lilly Melgar, an actress who played his love interest on
  General Hospital, Ricky's love life remains a mystery to all
  but his closest, most trusted friends.
  Upon reading this, my friend Alan, an edgy and so far unpaid
  humor writer, remarked, "I haven't seen tap-dancing like this
  since Fred Astaire hoofed it up in "Holiday Inn."  In my
  business, pal, the rules are understood.  I have to be nice.
  I have to create heroes.
