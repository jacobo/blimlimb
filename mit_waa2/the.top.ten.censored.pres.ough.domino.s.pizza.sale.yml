  NO. 10 Most Censored Press Release of 1998:
  THE YEAR IN PIZZA
  A Look at 1998 through Domino's Pizza Sales
  PRNewswire 28-DEC-98
  ANN ARBOR, Mich., Dec. 28 /PRNewswire/-- Now, here's a way to interpret
  1998: Measure the year in pizzas! In 1998, Domino's sold 338 million 
  pizzas with sales mirroring the historic highs and lows of the year.
  All those touchdowns make people hungry. While the Denver Broncos
  defeated the Green Bay Packers on Super Bowl Sunday, January 25,
  Domino's Pizza sales nearly doubled.
  Oh, to look svelte in that dress on Oscar night. That's what the stars
  want-- and the rest of the country may feel the same way, reaching for
  carrots and celery. Domino's Pizza's sales held steady the night of the
  Oscars on March 23 when "Titanic" snagged Best Picture.
  Savor this tasty statistic because we might not have a comparison for
  1999: The night of the NBA Finals, June 14, when the Chicago Bulls
  defeated the Utah Jazz to win their sixth title, Americans ate 18% more
  Domino's pizzas.
  Pizza sales linked to the Dow? That's why Domino's Pizza sales were up
  nearly 4% on August 31, the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
  at its lowest point of the year. Conversely, on November 23, when the
  Dow Jones hit its high mark, Americans celebrated by not eating pizza--
  Domino's pizza sales were only up .49%.
  As President Clinton confessed to the world on August 17, political
  insiders and all Americans reached for the phone. Domino's Pizza orders
  that day were up by 23,000 pies.
  On September 1, millions of people went to the video store and then
  watched at home while "Titanic" sank. That evening, the number of pizzas
  sold at Domino's rose 27% over a normal night.
  While Hurricane Georges tore through the Dominican Republic on September
  22, people in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean reeled from the destruction,
  and those in Haiti and the U.S. feared what was yet to come, illustrated
  by Domino's Pizza's 9% decrease in pizzas sold that day.
  Swinging for the last time this season, at 3:19 p.m. CDT on September
  27, Mark McGwire set baseball's single season homerun record with number
  70. In the spirit of baseball, many Americans may have opted for hot
  dogs and apple pie, as Domino's Pizza sold only 1.6% more pizzas than
  usual.
  On October 22, the New York Yankees finished one of the best seasons in
  sports history, completing their four-game sweep of the San Diego
  Padres, and claiming their 24th World Series title. As the world shared
  in the Yankees' joy, Domino's Pizza sales dropped by over 2%. Maybe fans
  were too nervous to eat.
  Thirty-six years after his historic flight as the first American to
  orbit the earth, John Glenn returned to space on October 29. Millions of
  people around the world watched, pizza in hand, resulting in an 11.4%
  increase in sales compared to a normal day for Domino's Pizza.
  Ghouls, ghosts and goblins must eat a lot of pizza. Halloween, October
  31, proved to be one of Domino's busiest days of the year, delivering
  more than 1.2 million pizzas across the country.
  As families around the country prepared for Thanksgiving, Domino's Pizza
  sales increased nearly 50% on November 25, Thanksgiving eve. Just an
  average Saturday night. In the midst of impeachment and military action
  on December 19, Americans kept to their old habits, eating just more
  than the Saturday average of one million Domino's pizzas.
  Domino's Pizza, Inc. was founded in 1960 and is recognized as the world
  leader in pizza delivery. In 1997 sales reached $3.2 billion, making it
  Domino's fifth consecutive year of increased sales. Domino's Pizza, with
  more than 1,700 franchisees, operates more than 6,100 stores throughout
  the United States and in 64 international markets.
