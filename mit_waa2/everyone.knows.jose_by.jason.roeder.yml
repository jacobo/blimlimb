- Brenda King, MIT alumna
- "\"Yeah, we worked with Jose Canseco in the '80s, early '90s."
- |
  

- He told us that with steroids, we could enhance our herds and make our cows produce longer-lasting milk and more of it.
- |
  

- But it just passed on the aggressive side effects to consumers.
- |
  

- You really can't ignore the fact that most of those rioters a few years back were holding milkshakes.

- Kevin Hochschild, Dairy Farmers Association of America spokesperson
- "\"I think it's better that I come clean on this personally before Mr. Canseco gets a chance to."
- |
  

- Yes, given the demanding physicality of many of our sketches, steroids were abused by myself and many others.
- |
  

- We covered this up for decades, and as a result, the drugs took their mutating toll.
- |
  

- I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's actually no such thing as a Muppet.
