  The camera operator shall be of the same sex you are, unless you request otherwise. This option may not be possible in some areas.
  During this search, assuming compliancy, a privacy barrier (e.g. curtain, wall, sheet, screen, door, cardboard, beach towel, piece of wood, office cubicle divider, or any other similar barrier preventing visual inspection of the private parts) shall be placed between you and the camera operator.
  If compliancy is not assured and/or there is the threat of your resistance, camera operators are instructed to videotape both you and the officer conducting the search simultaneously to protect against allegations of interactions, in which case all or partial nudity may be captured on videotape.
