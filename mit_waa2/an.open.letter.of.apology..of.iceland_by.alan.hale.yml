  I would like to take this opportunity to finally, formally, apologize to the country of Iceland.
  What I did was wrong. All of it. From the merciless exploitation of the country's natural resources, to the ill-advised economic reforms in which the national currency was replaced with various flavors of Fruit Roll-Ups, to the (now) infamous incident with Bjork, ten thousand tubes of model airplane glue, and a roll of duct tape. What I did was wrong.
  I guess I was going through a rough period in my life. I had just broken up with my girlfriend, and I was unhappy with my job. I remember clearly how it started: I awoke one Saturday morning, feeling empty and alone. I bumbled into the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and thought: "I'm gonna quit my job and go fuck with the country of Iceland."
  So, I'm trying to make amends. I'm giving all the babies back. Palace guards are no longer required to refer to me as "The Great Goombah." Henceforth, state television is no longer required to air video of me sitting on my couch all day long. Jell-O fights are no longer the means of arbitrating justice. When speaking directly to me, it is no longer required that Icelanders blink excitedly and preface their comments with "Holy jeez, will you look at that!" You can start using the letter "T" again. Pull My Finger is no longer the national sport.
  I have some confessions to make. There is no death ray. It's just a couple of empty coffee cans covered in aluminum foil with wires sticking out each end.
