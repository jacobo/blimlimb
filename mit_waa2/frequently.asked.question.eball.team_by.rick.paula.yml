- Or doubles.
- What can I expect from my zombie on the basepaths?
- Due to the zombie's stiff-legged, arms-straight-to-the-front running style, the zombie has "Mo Vaughn carrying an El Camino on his back" speed. Do not expect the zombie to successfully steal on anyone other than Mike Piazza.

- Can zombies pitch?
- Without the proper torque of a healthy shoulder (the rotator-cuff muscle deteriorates after death), the zombie lacks the ability to throw with power.

- Couldn't a zombie maybe be a knuckleballer?
- Despite rumors to the contrary regarding the unprecedented length of Gaylord Perry's career, there is very little evidence to suggest that he was one of the undead.

  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING ADDING A ZOMBIE TO YOUR FANTASY BASEBALL TEAM.
  What kind of hitter is the typical zombie?
  Government-sanctioned laboratory experiments show us that the zombie can learn short, repetitive tasks like flipping a switch, licking an envelope (despite lacking saliva-production capabilities), and checking e-mail. Recognizing a strike zone or sitting on an inside, belt-high fastball is a different story, however. Like Adam Dunn, the zombie strikes out often. Unlike Adam Dunn, the zombie never hits home runs. Or doubles.
  What can I expect from my zombie on the basepaths?
  Due to the zombie's stiff-legged, arms-straight-to-the-front running style, the zombie has "Mo Vaughn carrying an El Camino on his back" speed. Do not expect the zombie to successfully steal on anyone other than Mike Piazza.
  On the plus side, the zombie cannot slide, which makes him great at breaking up the double play by taking a ball off the schnoz Posada-style. Being impervious to pain, the zombie will not need to go on the DL when this does happen. Unfortunately, the zombie's hunger for the second baseman's brains makes him easy prey to a decent pickoff move.
  Will my zombie be at least adequate in the field?
  Because he cannot bend at the knees, the zombie routinely lets routine grounders through his legs. When a ball does land in his glove, his throws are heavily inaccurate. Zombies are always heckled with shouts of "Buckner!," "Knoblauch!," or "Where's your brain?!"
  Can zombies pitch?
  Without the proper torque of a healthy shoulder (the rotator-cuff muscle deteriorates after death), the zombie lacks the ability to throw with power. Top speed: 45 mph.
  Couldn't a zombie maybe be a knuckleballer?
  Despite rumors to the contrary regarding the unprecedented length of Gaylord Perry's career, there is very little evidence to suggest that he was one of the undead.

  Cubs first baseman Derrek Lee is a zombie from April through mid-June. Dodgers catcher Paul Lo Duca is usually infected by the zombie virus around the All-Star break. Ken Griffey Jr. seems to have exited his zombie period of 2001-2003. The entire Boston Red Sox team turns into zombies by late October.
