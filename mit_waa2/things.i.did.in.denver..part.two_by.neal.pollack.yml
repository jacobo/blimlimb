- All about me, bodies flew, skulls cracked, and the third-party movement wilted in pain.
- |
  

- People bearing my masked likeness were spread across the floor.
- |
  

- The Mennonites shivered in a corner as the police cut through the crowd like a knife through an open tub of  I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.
- |
  

- My goodness.
- |
  

- Were those Ewoks I saw running for the exit?
- The city of Denver, I thought, was clearly losing its innocence.
- I felt stern Arab-American hands grab me from behind.
- "\"We have to run!"
- "\" Nader hissed."
- The police had nearly broken through to the stage now, and there appeared to be no clear escape for the father of consumer rights and myself.
- |
  

- The Mercury Caf&eacute;, home to so many feminist rallies and solidarity potlucks, was about to be consumed by the unholy flames of domestic fascism.
- A squat Klingon burst through the encroaching police line and removed his mask.
- |
  

- He was massively built, almost irredeemably handsome, and, actually, quite amusing.
- |
  

- His name, I later learned, was Christopher Dougherty, private first class, U.S.
- |
  

- Army Rangers, Special Forces Division.
- "\"I may be a Republican reactionary at heart,\""
- |
  

- "\"But I'll be goddamned if I'll let a bunch of badly-trained stormtroopers walk all over our hard-won freedoms!"
- With an unholy yell, Private Dougherty charged into the encroaching mess of cops.
- |
  

- He kicked and punched, pinched and thrust.
- |
  

- They fell to a man, grasping at him, but never exactly connecting.
- |
  

- Nothing could stop Christopher Dougherty, All-American fighting machine.
- |
  

- Nader and I saw a hole in the line, and darted through.
- "\"In the name of advocacy, run!"
- "\" he yelled."
- A cop, the big one with the robot arm, produced a taser, lunged, and connected with Private Dougherty's right wrist.
- |
  

- Our defender sizzled briefly, and yelped in pain.
- |
  

- He staggered, brought down two more cops, and collapsed into a platter of tabbouleh.
- I saw stars, several of them.
- |
  

- Former child stars, actually.
- |
  

- Then I felt something wet on the back of my head.
- |
  

- Then I blacked out.
- |
  

- I awoke after seemed like a week, or maybe two weeks.
- |
  

- In fact, it was two minutes and 30 seconds.
- |
  

- I was in a Dumpster, in an alley.
- |
  

- Nader was next to me, seemingly asleep.
- |
  

- Three men leaned in to look at us.
- |
  

- They seemed proud and brave.
- "\"Who."
- |
  

- "\" I said with ellipses between each word."
- "\"You have allies here,\""
- |
  

- "\"Matt Barker, Green Party delegate--Little Rock, Arkansas."
- "\"Yes,\""
- |
  

- "\"Not everyone in Denver is with Mayor Webb, and certainly not me, Larry L. Carlile."
- The third man said, "that's right, and the people of Fort Collins, Colorado, including myself, Alex Paozols, also support your struggle for freedom.
- Nader, who had been playing possum, said, "but how can we get out of here?
- |
  

- I have a rally in North Dakota on Tuesday.
- From above, we heard a faint buzz, which grew louder, until it was a well-oiled roar.
- |
  

- An airplane!
- The plane puffed and feinted, did a 360 loop, and seemed to stop in mid-air and swoop down onto the pavement.
- |
  

- I had never seen an airplane land in an alley before, but it was as though this pilot had maneuvered far more difficult arrangements in his time.
- On one side of this magical plane I saw written the words, "Valium Airlines.
- "\" On the other, the slogan, \""
- We Stay Up Longer.
- "\" From the cockpit emerged a man who, from the moment I saw him, I knew was obviously a genius."
- "\"I am Richard Schein of the Civil Air Patrol!"
- "\" he said."
- |
  

- "\"But you can call me Captain Rick."
- "\"OK,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"Would you like an M.R."
- E.
- |
  

- "\" he asked."
- "\"What's that?"
- "\" said Matt Barker, of Little Rock, Arkansas."
- "\"A Meal Ready to Eat,\""
- |
  

- Captain Rick.
- |
  

- "\"Prepared by the Air Force during Vietnam."
- "\" He reached into a canvas bag."
- |
  

- "\"Let's see."
- |
  

- I have Beef Stew, Omelet with Ham, Veal Stroganoff.
- |
  

- "\"Yummy!"
- "\" Ralph Nader said."
- |
  

- "\"I'm starving!"
- In the near distance, we heard explosions, and smoke could be smelt.
- "\"Time to fly,\""
- |
  

- Captain Rick.
- "\"Where are we going?"
- "\" asked our next President."
- "\"Well,\""
- |
  

- Captain, "I thought we could spend the holiday at my house in the mountains, drink some Scotch, and play some pinball.
- That sounded great.
- As Valium Airlines ascended from the alley, Matt Barker, Larry L. Carlile, and Alex Paozols all saluted.
- |
  

- I know that someday, I will see those noble patriots again.
- Captain Rick did a loop around Denver.
- |
  

- All about was chaos.
- |
  

- Mayor Webb had dispatched his soldiers to quell uprisings around the city, which was in flames.
- |
  

- Near Washington Park, I saw a lone citizen clutching two shopping bags, standing in front of a tank.
- |
  

- He was the living symbol of resistance against oppression.
- |
  

- The martyrs of Denver, including him, shall never be forgotten.
- The Captain made one more run by the Mercury Caf&eacute;.
- |
  

- Sure enough, we saw Darth Webb in front, shaking his lead officer by the lapel.
- |
  

- "We couldn't hear him from the air, but he was probably saying something like:"
- "\"How could you let them get away?"
- |
  

- You fool!
- We buzzed him close, and I let him get a good look at my face.
- |
  

- Nader just laughed and ate his omelet with ham.
- "\"I'll get you, Pollack!"
- "\" shouted Mayor Webb."
- |
  

- "\"I'll get you next time!"
- As Captain Rick turned the plane west toward the mountain, I gritted my teeth and felt revenge in my platelets.
- "\"Oh no, Mayor Webb,\""
- |
  

- I said quietly.
- |
  

- "\"Next time, you're mine."
