- I love to run, jump, and play.

- I am quite sturdy and very dependable.
- |

- |
  

- Let's make a home together.
- "Suggested:  They call me Hootie here at the center, but on the street I go by Psycho."
- |
  

- I love to run, jump, and kick ass.
- |
  

- Finding life a little rough on the playground?
- |
  

- Hey, being 12 ain't easy.
- |
  

- Oh, sure, you could take karate lessons.
- |
  

- But it will take, like, two, maybe three, years to make a difference.
- |
  

- You got that kind of time?
- |
  

- Didn't think so.
- |
  

- But me?
- |
  

- I'm Bruce Lee on a leash and I'm ready to let these paws of fury fly.

- I don't understand why and I really need someone who will love me and help me to trust again.
- |
  

- I'm a sweet cat and will make the perfect companion for someone who can love me as much as I love her.
- |
  

- Could that be you?
- |
  

- I sure hope so!
- "Suggested:  Look, I know the deal."
- |
  

- You weren't supposed to end up 37, single, and stuck in a midlevel management career, were you?
- |
  

- And he hasn't left his wife yet, has he?
- |
  

- No, he hasn't.
- |
  

- Well, shit happens.
- |
  

- Trust me, I know about heartache.
- |
  

- My loving owners "forgot" me in a Kmart parking lot. But I'll be here for you. Let's learn to trust again, together. I'll grab my catnip. Where are we parked?

- Please come down and say hello.
- |
  

- Until you come, I'll be waiting here.
- |
  

- "Full disclosure: I have a hyperthyroid and am blind in one eye."
- |
  

- Hasn't slowed me down, though, and I'm sure it's something you can handle.
- "Suggested:  Let's get real honest."
- |
  

- If I don't come home with you, I'm taking a one-way trip on the needle express.
- |
  

- And all those touchy-feely posters out front describing the center's painless euthanasia procedure?
- |
  

- Says who?
- |
  

- We can't talk, you know.
- |
  

- It's your call.

- I would love it if someone could take me home and spoil me rotten.
- |
  

- I love playing ball and never turn down a good belly rub.
- |
  

- I know sit, stay, lie down, heel, and I can give a high-five.
- |
  

- And I love kids.
- "Suggested:  The nameplate says Chester, but you can just call me the answer to all your problems."
- |
  

- Been on the road a lot?
- |
  

- Haven't been able to spend much time with the kids?
- |
  

- I know the signs.

- I bark but only when excited and/or playing.
- |
  

- I'm trained to go on a wee-wee pad, and also to do my business outside while out for a walk.
- |
  

- Whoever adopts me is getting the best of the bunch!
- "Suggested:  Fluffy here and I'm the little spitfire you've been looking for."
- |
  

- You see, to me it's all about teamwork.
- |
  

- Take me home and let those jerkoff neighbors in 3C know, "I'll see your colicky newborn and raise you a socially maladjusted Pomeranian.
- "\" And, hey, maybe their welcome mat\x97you know, that stupid one with the happy face on it\x97becomes my new wee-wee pad."
- |
  

- Ready when you are, partner.
