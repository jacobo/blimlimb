- SCENE 1
- |
  

- A bedroom in the home of Juan Ponce de Leon, San Juan, Puerto Rico.
- |
  

- LEON's manservant, a Carib slave called RAUL, stands idly by.
- |
  

- "LEON (Looking in mirror, extracts a rotten looking molar): Damn, that's the third one this month."
- |
  

- Look at me, Raul.
- |
  

- My teeth are falling out, my hair is thinning, my ass barely fits in my pantaloons.
- |
  

- I'm falling apart here.
- "RAUL: Beg your pardon, my lord, but perhaps it's time you visited the Fountain of Youth."
- "LEON (Turning): How's that?"
- |
  

- You have a Fountain of Youth and I'm just now hearing about it?
- "RAUL: We don't like to spread it around."
- |
  

- It could bring in the wrong kind of crowd.
- "LEON: I order you to take me there immediately!"
- |
  

- That is an order!
- "RAUL: I cannot go, my lord."
- |
  

- It is forbidden.
- |
  

- But I can give some vague directions.
- "LEON: Deal."
- |
  

- Let me grab a quill and some parchment.
- |
  

- Fumbling) Okay, shoot.
- "RAUL: First of all, it's not really a fountain."
- |
  

- It's more of a stream, or a trickle.
- |
  

- You know how these things are exaggerated.
- "LEON: Yes, yes."
- |
  

- Go on.
- "RAUL: And as for its restorative powers, well, I recommend only drinking a drop or two."
- |
  

- You don't want to overdo it.
- "LEON: I see."
- "RAUL: Anyway, the Fountain is located on the legendary island paradise of Bimini, just north of Cuba."
- |
  

- You can't miss it.
- "LEON: Bimini."
- |
  

- North of Cuba.
- |
  

- Got it.
- |
  

- We sail tonight!
- |
  

- Pause) Well, maybe not tonight.
- |
  

- Tomorrow will do.
- |
  

- Okay, in two years after I get a commission from the king.
- |
  

- And ships.
- |
  

- And a crew.
- |
  

- Then we sail.
- |

- Eleven years later, on the beach near present-day Tampa Bay)
- "AIDE: We are doomed, my lord."
- |
  

- The Calusa have us with our backs to the sea.
- "LEON: It's got to be around here someplace."
- |
  

- Damn those meddling Indians.
- "AIDE: We must retreat to the launch, my lord."
- |
  

- What good's a Fountain of Youth to a pincushion?
- "LEON: That's why they're putting up such a fight."
- |
  

- We must be close.
- |
  

- Very close.
- "AIDE: My lord, we have searched for this elusive fountain for nine years."
- |
  

- Did you ever stop to think, maybe it was all a ruse?
- |
  

- A wild goose chase?
- "LEON: A ruse, huh?"
- |
  

- Waves the thought away) Fie!
- |
  

- It must exist.
- |
  

- What about all the crazy stories, the silly songs, the absurd legends?
- |
  

- No, it is my destiny to be the Fountain's discoverer.
- |
  

- Columbus may have found a shortcut to India, but Leon will be the one they remember!
- |
  

- Bwahahahahaha!
- |
  

- LEON receives an arrow in the gut.
- |
  

- Oh shit!
- "AIDE: My lord."
- |
  

- You have been shot!
- "LEON: Alas, I am slain."
- |
  

- Raving) And yet I am too young to die!
- "AIDE: My lord, you are sixty-one."
- "LEON: Your point?"
- "AIDE: Well, I mean, the average life span is only like 32 or something."
- "LEON: (Shaking a fist heavenward) What cruel trick is this, O God?"
- |
  

- To be so close to restoring my precious youth only to be snuffed out by a barbarian's dart.
- |
  

- Aside) Rats, I think I just crapped my pants.
- |
  

- To heaven) Another one of your tricks?
- "AIDE: My lord, we must hurry."
- "LEON: But the Fountain."
- |
  

- La Fountaine!
- |
  

- LEON falls to his knees, weeps.
- |
  

- "AIDE (Lifting LEON onto his shoulders): Upsy Daisy."
- |
  

- There we go, my lord.
- "LEON: Wait, where are you taking me?"
- "AIDE: To Cuba, my lord."
- |
  

- Where you'll be looked after.
- "LEON: Yes."
- |
  

- To Cuba then.
- |
  

- Exit)
- |
  

- Enter two Indians)
- "FIRST INDIAN: Look at them run."
- |
  

- They won't be back any time soon.
- "SECOND INDIAN: Did you notice how I nailed that one old dude right in the guts?"
- |
  

- A direct hit.
- |
  

- That was beautiful.
- "FIRST INDIAN: Yeah."
- |
  

- Say, want to stop at The Fountain for a drink?
- "SECOND INDIAN: Can't."
- |
  

- Promised the squaw I'd come right home after the massacre.
- "FIRST INDIAN (Makes whipping sound): Whackshhhhhh!"
- |
  

- "SECOND INDIAN: Stop that."
- "FIRST INDIAN: Whackshhhhhh!"
- |
  

- Exit)
- "Epilogue: Ponce de Leon died, many years before he could see a certain fellow Puerto Rican take the North American continent by storm."
- |
  

- The Indians died, too, but later than de Leon.
- |
  

- And it looks like the Yankees in four.
