  Icelandic system  [iys-lan'-dik sis'- tum]  n . (also  teen circulation plan ) a practice, supposedly based on child-rearing methods in medieval Iceland, of sending teenagers to live with other families, in order to learn adult skills and behavior from grownups they have not yet learned to manipulate and despise. A version of the Icelandic system, the foreign-student exchange, had long been employed by frustrated parents, but the practice went native and exploded in popularity with the publication, in 2023, of Britney-Penelope Leach's bestselling advice manual,  A Fresh Start: Why Other Parents Can Raise Your Impossible Teen&#8212;and Why You Should Let Them .   Leach noted that, away from their parents, adolescents were typically friendly, polite, curious, and altruistic; it was only at home that they became resentful and histrionic \"typical teenagers.\" She proposed placing teens with new families to give them a less-cathected but still affectionate and protective adult-child relationship focused on the gradual assumption of adulthood.

  pasta with grilled vegetables  [pah'- stuh with grild vedj'-tuh-buls]  n.  [ archaic ] vegetarian entr\xE9e struck down by the landmark Supreme Court ruling in  Mercer v. Bennigan's  (2019). In a 6-3 decision, the Court ruled that pasta with grilled vegetables is an unconstitutional dinner offering and that chain restaurants in the Midwest must, \"with all deliberate speed and all fresh ingredients,\" add another vegetarian selection. The Court stopped short of mandating a specific menu, but it did make a few nice suggestions involving tempeh and tofu. Chief Justice Nickerson wrote the majority opinion:  \"The court finds untenable the notion that flaccid, tasteless disks of yellow squash languishing atop rubbery spaghetti constitutes a lawful American dinner or freedom of choice,\"  Nickerson wrote,  \"to say nothing of the cruel and unusual heat lamp.\"  In 2035, the Court upheld  Mercer v.
