- |
  

- Don't call for help, because we're not coming!
- |
  

- The Black Hole of Calcutta, a heinous incident reputed to have taken place in 1756, is a dark episode in Indian-British relations.
- |
  

- Should our customers wish to never find themselves locked in a 24' by 18' windowless room with dozens of other dying men, please do not visit the bathroom behind the salad bar.
- |
  

- If our customers ever unhappily find themselves in such a dire situation, we advise against the serving of any Black Forest concoction, as any amateur epicure knows that Black Forest is a gooey, chocolicious treat typically employing cherries.
- |
  

- We do recommend serving water, cold presses, and possibly oxygen tanks, if available.
- |
  

- "Chess Pie: $4."
- |
  

- A real chess board is laid at the bottom of the pan, and rook cookies are hidden throughout.
- |
  

- Playing games prior to 550 C.E.
- |
  

- Then a few nearly dead men with a latent if bloody sense of decorum realized they could throw rocks and kill things over a pretty black and white board.
- |
  

- Alas, chess was born, and hundreds of years later, chess pie, which has very little to do with the game of chess and more to do with a half-cup of whipped cream mixed with sugar and baked for one hour at 350 degrees.
- |
  

- We'd say some joke here with "checkmate" in it, such as "Eat this and then ask for your check, mate," but the legal team behind The '50s Diner has advised us to forgo that sort of thing.

  Romulus and ReMustard Chicken: $11.00
   When Rome was established in 753 B.C.E., the brothers Romulus and Remus may have disdained utensils for their hairy mother's lupine teat, but we recommend a fork for this dish. Downing this savory blend of chicken, mustard, and pasta is nearly as satisfying as suckling a she-wolf!

Do not start signing "Emperor" before your name and do not build any aqueducts or Coliseums if you can help it.)
  Celestial Crab Cakes: $13.00
   1054 C.E. &#8212;what a hopping, bopping time! When you weren't defending your cave with 
  dull-edged pottery shards, you were taking a moment to gaze up in abject fear at the colossal 
  supernova that formed the Crab Nebula. Our spicy crab cakes don't contain the ashes of our 
  ancestors, but they will make you see stars! (Or more likely visions of your ancient ancestors,

  Desserts
  The Black Forest Hole of Calcutta: $5.00
   146 starving men couldn't eat this mountain of cherries and molten fudge if their last breaths depended on it! Don't call for help, because we're not coming! (The Black Hole of Calcutta, a heinous incident reputed to have taken place in 1756, is a dark episode in Indian-British relations. Should our customers wish to never find themselves locked in a 24' by 18' windowless room with dozens of other dying men, please do not visit the bathroom behind the salad bar.

  Chess Pie: $4.00
   A real chess board is laid at the bottom of the pan, and rook cookies are hidden throughout. (Playing games prior to 550 C.E. involved a lot of rock-throwing and bloodshed, as well as some rocking of bloody sheds and shed-throwing and some more rocks and blood. Then a few nearly dead men with a latent if bloody sense of decorum realized they could throw rocks and kill things over a pretty black and white board. Alas, chess was born, and hundreds of years later, chess pie, which has very little to do with the game of chess and more to do with a half-cup of whipped cream mixed with sugar and baked for one hour at 350 degrees.
