  MAGGIE
  I know we have to invite your sister to the wedding, but does
  she have to bring Jack?
  PETER
  Jack's OK, if he would simply refrain from drinking.
  WOLF-BOY
  Ooowwwllll.  Yap Yap Yap.
  MAGGIE
  He's just tiresome&#151;his whole act, talking about his grandiose
  business plans.  He'll probably start hitting up papa for financial
  backing.  It's all just so... tiresome.
  PETER
  Well, you were the one who wanted this whole church wedding and
  reception.  I said, "Let's go before the magistrate," but then your
  mother got involved, and now you don't want to invite my brother-in-law.

  MAGGIE

  MAGGIE
  [exasperated, continuing]
  I was sitting in the study doing my needlepoint and she comes in 
  and looks over my shoulder for a minute or
  two, then she has the nerve to say: "You dropped a stitch."  I mean
  really.
  PETER
  Darling, listen... when this thing is over and we have survived
  it, all that will matter is that we shall be together.
  CANNONBALL SID
  [landing]
  Oooff...
  [Hard shoes on wood signify the entrance of a matron.]

  Ma ma ! I didn't know you were coming down today.
