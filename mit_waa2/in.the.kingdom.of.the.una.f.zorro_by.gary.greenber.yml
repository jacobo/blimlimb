  Background: In 1998, Gary Greenberg, a psychotherapist living in rural
  Connecticut, began a correspondence with Ted Kaczynski, the murderer
  known as the Unabomber. He and Kaczynski exchanged dozens of letters,
  with some of Kaczynski's as long as 20 pages. In the letters, they
  discussed the insidious influence of technology, the
  preservation of wild nature, the dubious claims and conclusions of the
  psychiatric profession, the appetites and proclivities of the American
  media, Kaczynski's life in prison, the choices made by Kaczynski's
  family, and the lessons of Russian feudalism.
  In a wide-ranging essay, Greenberg discusses the evolution and
  dissolution of his relationship with Kaczynski, along the way
  eviscerating the media that courted and then
  devoured the Unabomber, the judicial system that did everything possible
  to avoid another O.J. sort of trial, and the psychiatrists who muted
  Kaczynski's principles by labeling them as paranoid schizophrenia.
  Please note: a) This story is absolutely real; b) The excerpts being
  presented comprise only a portion of Mr. Greenberg's article, which in
  its entirety is 23,000 words or so; c) The order of the excerpts is not
  necessarily the same as that in the print version.
