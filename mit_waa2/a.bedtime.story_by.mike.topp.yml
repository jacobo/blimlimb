- It's hard to get Jordan Rochester to understand me and first of all I didn't tattletell on her and I never annoy her and I didn't do anything to her and I will tell anyone I want.
- |
  

- She can't tell me what to do.
- |
  

- She hates me and I will hate her and my life is very bad.
- |
  

- I want to move to Spain and I feel like crying every minute and nobody cares and I hate this school and I hate the other kids because they don't care about me sometimes.

- And Jordan Rochester is always mean to me for no
- |
  

- I think she is sensitive.

- Dear Jordan Rochester,
- I'm really really really sorry for the rumors and being with the attitude at gym and tattletelling and I'm sorry with my whole heart.
- |
  

- And also you should not be talking behind my back and cause I don't like that and you wouldn't like it.
- |
  

- I'm so sorry if I annoy you or something.
- |
  

- I'm sorry if I got you mad and bother you.
- |
  

- I'm sorry for everything bad and please forgive me for everything.
- |
  

- I really want to be your friend and a good one please.
- |
  

- "I'm sorry and can I ask you a question: \"Is Nina not my friend because of you?"
- Sincerely,
- Diana
- "PS: Please write back."

- One day in the city that never sleeps, Diana, Scott (her brother), their mom, dad, and day tutor were sitting by the fire when the phone rang.

- "\"Hey, Diana,\""
- |
  

- Nina said, "Did you hear on the news the old Rochester house is on fire?

- Oh, my God!
- |
  

- It is?
- |
  

- Okay, I'm coming over!
- "\" After getting off the phone with Nina, Diana ran out the door and all the way to Nina's house."

- They went to the Rochester house together.
- |
  

- When they got there the fire was coming out the windows and every way you can think of in your mind.
- |
  

- At about 6:37 PM in the evening they left but just before Diana walked out of range of the fire she saw the faint figure of a devil in the smoke from the fire.
- |
  

- When Diana got home she hopped into bed and then shut off the light.
- |
  

- About five minutes after shutting off the light she drifted into a deep deep sleep.
- |
  

- She dreamed about her father going away and dying in a plane crash.
- |
  

- Before she finished her dream her mom woke her up for school.

  One day in the city that never sleeps, Diana, Scott (her brother), their mom, dad, and day tutor were sitting by the fire when the phone rang. "Hello?" Diana said. "Hey, Diana," Nina said, "Did you hear on the news the old Rochester house is on fire?" "Oh, my God! It is? Okay, I'm coming over!" After getting off the phone with Nina, Diana ran out the door and all the way to Nina's house. They went to the Rochester house together. When they got there the fire was coming out the windows and every way you can think of in your mind.
