- Day 1
- Instead of our normal trip to Grandma's in Oregon, our parents drove to the Nevada desert for Burning Man.
- |
  

- Mom and Dad explained that their relationship was in a rut, and they wanted to try something new.
- |
  

- Mom said that Dad isn't spontaneous anymore.
- |
  

- Dad complained that Burning Man tickets are more expensive than a week at Disneyland, but Mom said that the drugs are better here.
- We got here in the morning.
- |
  

- The car broke down, so Dad traded it for a sheet of stamps that had Woodstock on them.
- |
  

- Mom and Dad ate some of the stamps, and Mom changed into a tie-dyed dress.
- |
  

- Dad said he was tripping, but I think he's walking fine.
- Burning Man is neat.
- |
  

- There are lots and lots of friendly people, and many ladies who wear only face paint.
- |
  

- And everybody smells weird, like a combination of body odor and some perfume that also smells like body odor.
- Day 2
- Today is arts and crafts.
- |
  

- Kelley and I sat under a tent with the arts counselor, a guy with a top hat who says his name's Posternutbag.
- |
  

- "We're learning to macram\xE9 bong cozies."
- |
  

- A bong is like a vase.
- |
  

- Kelley has done it before.
- |
  

- I always thought it was a thing for girls, but Posternutbag said I should liberate my feminine side.
- |
  

- He's giving me a quarter for every one I make, because afterward he's going to sell them in the parking lot at Dead shows.
- I met the Burning Man mascot, Raffy the Rasta.
- |
  

- He's a puppet on stilts.
- |
  

- The best way to become Raffy's friend is to steal your parents' stash.
- Day 3
- Today was archery.
- |
  

- There's one group of people who are called rednecks.
- |
  

- They sell bottles of water to Burning Man people for $10, and when people complain, they shoot them with Tasers.
- |
  

- I got to do it once.
- |
  

- Then we went deer hunting.
- |
  

- The rednecks explained that the Burning Men always ran out of food, and there was nothing better than watching a hungry vegetarian eat deer.
- |
  

- The rednecks gave us soda and chips, and let us play video games in their trailer.
- |
  

- Then the rednecks had to leave because their meth lab was discovered.
- I haven't seen Mom all day.
- |
  

- Dad said she is on a coke binge, which he says is good because she needed to lose weight.
- |
  

- Dad says he's met lots of nice ladies.
- |
  

- Dad also says that massage class at the community college has really paid off.
- Our babysitter, Luna, is awesome.
- |
  

- She said we don't need to eat our vegetables, because they represent agronomic tyranny.
- |
  

- And she's taking us to a rave later.
- Day 4
- The rave last night was fun!
- |
  

- It was like a dance for homeless people.
- This morning Dad explained that he was going on a vision quest with a woman named Astrolab.
- |
  

- She is from Sedona, and she doesn't like to wear bras.
- |
  

- Or pants.
- |
  

- Since Mom hasn't come back from the Goa-trance ecstasy workshop, Dad left us with the pirate kickball league.
- |
  

- It's like regular kickball, but whenever you go up to the plate, you can take a bong hit.
- |
  

- I'm really hungry now.
- |
  

- The only food the pirates had was sugar-free seitan roll-ups.
- |
  

- After the game, Kelley cried because she was hungry, so we walked around for a while, looking at all the naked people wrestling in their tents.
- |
  

- Finally, we found some vegans, who promised to feed us.
- |
  

- I think "vegan" means "skinny.
- The vegans are nice, but they burned our clothes for fuel because cotton is bad, and dressed us in hemp togas.
- |
  

- I like mine, although it's weird not wearing any underwear.
- |
  

- Kelley cried because her hemp dress is scratchy.
- |
  

- Then I met some kids who found some irrigation ditches to play in.
- Day 5
- Our newest friends, Nevada state troopers, rescued us from a tribe of feral belly dancers.
- |
  

- After they subdued the belly dancers with pepper spray, they fed us peanut-butter sandwiches on real (store-bought) bread.
- |
  

- And ice cream!
- They took us back to our campsite, where Mom was waiting with more troopers and her new boyfriend, Jesse.
- |
  

- The troopers made Mom promise to leave immediately.
- |
  

- Jesse helped me roll up our tent, which was filled with something called paraphernalia.
- Jesse said that he can't believe that the cryptofascist law firm wouldn't pay for his Burning Man tickets as part of the employee wellness program.
- |
  

- He said the Man (not the burning one) is keeping him down.
- |
  

- He said that private property is the "s" word. Then he got mad when I borrowed his Nintendo without asking.
- We had to drive home before they burned the Man.
- |
  

- Instead, we saw more naked women.
- |
  

- Mom said we could stay at a KOA and have our own campfire and burn our own man, but I'd rather go home and go back to my school.
