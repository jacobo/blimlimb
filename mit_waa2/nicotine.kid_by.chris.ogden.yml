- I've been smoking since I could hold a spoon.
- |
  

- Mom and Gramps used to leave cigarettes burning in ashtrays all over the house, so I never even had to struggle to find a light.
- |
  

- My first puff, I didn't even cough.
- |
  

- It's like I was born to smoke.
- |
  

- Dad smokes too, Marlboro Red pack.
- |
  

- Mom and Gramps, ultra lights.
- |
  

- Me, I'm not picky&#8212;as long as it's lit, I'll smoke it.
- |
  

- Except for Camels.
- |
  

- Just because I'm 9 doesn't mean I like all cartoon characters.
- Most of the time, I'd smoke right in the same room with my parents and Gramps and they never even noticed.
- |
  

- In fact, the house was so filled with smoke, I wasn't even sure what they looked like until the winter of '98.
- |
  

- A huge blizzard hit, we ran out of cigarettes, and we couldn't get the car out of the driveway.
- |
  

- Gramps headed out anyway but had to turn back.
- |
  

- I still don't understand why they don't make snow tires for wheelchairs.
- |
  

- So, there we were, home together with nothing to smoke, and I got my first real look at everyone.
- |
  

- Mom was ugly, Dad was uglier, and Gramps looked just like a lizard.
- |
  

- It was a bad scene, but I learned a lot of really good swear words.
- I tried to quit when I was 7. The nicotine gum was great, but I got addicted to that too.
- |
  

- My bitch second-grade teacher, Mrs. Moore, kept making me spit it out, so I had to go back to smoking.
- |
  

- I made friends with Jesse the janitor.
- |
  

- He had a nice little office.
- |
  

- Actually, it was a utility closet, but for an ex-con, he really knew how to class things up.
- |
  

- Anyway, he gave me an extra key in return for the Devil Dogs Mom packed in my lunchbox every day.
- |
  

- He said they were really tasty.
- |
  

- I don't know, everything tastes the same to me.
- It was a great situation, I thought it would last forever, but I got caught thanks to Beamus McQuethy.
- |
  

- I guess he pulled his head out of Mrs. Moore's ass just long enough to spy on me.
- |
  

- One day, after a very enjoyable cigarette, I came out of the utility closet and the two of them were standing right there with the principal.
- |
  

- I thought the whole thing was totally funny until I found out that Jesse got fired and had to go work for Wal-Mart.
- I tried to quit again when I was 8. Not that I wanted to, but it was getting harder and harder to pull this off.
- |
  

- Once they installed smoke detectors in the bathrooms, I decided to try the patch.
- |
  

- Jesse hooked me up with a whole case.
- |
  

- They actually worked for a few days, but I needed more and more of them to keep my cravings away.
- |
  

- One day, I had on so many, it looked like I was wearing some kind of weird sweater.
- |
  

- Everybody thought it was cool, though, which really pissed off Beamus.
- |
  

- He wasn't in my class that year, but as a "hall monitor," he was assigned to watch my every move between classes. The last time I saw him, he was pouring nail-polish remover on all the pennies I Krazy Glued to the floor outside the science lab. Since the cheap school still hasn't hired another janitor, Beamus got stuck with all the hallway-related stuff. Rumor has it, when his father smelled nail-polish remover on him, he put him in military school. I think that's what they call karma.
- With Beamus out of the picture, I've been free to enjoy my butts under the stairway near the auditorium.
- |
  

- It's my new favorite place to smoke.
- |
  

- Sometimes I wonder if I'll outgrow it, but I'm not growing very much, so it seems unlikely.
