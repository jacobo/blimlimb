- "\"Happy Mother's Day, Mother!"
- "\" we shouted, tumbling in with our splashy bouquets and best wishes and biggest hugs."
- Startled, our mother squatted and rooted around for a stick, then hurled it at us with considerable strength.

- It passed clumsily by my head, followed by a rough bit of rock, then a shale disc that connected smartly with my shoulder.

- Rubbing my arm and laughing, I waved off the others' help.
- "\"Oh, Mom,\""
- |
  

- She was naked and filthy and had a smudgy nest of grubs on one leg that she would occasionally stroke with a tenderness only a mother can show.
- She had no intention of putting on a proper dress or giving up her grubs, so everyone stood there silently for a moment.

- The expensive blossom stopped and formed a bulge in her throat.
- I then pulled out my corsage, a delicate grouping of mauve  carnations for the wrist with a handy snapback elastic band.

- Mother ate the carnations as well, then spit them out, then finally coughed up the orchid wetly onto the ground.

- The half-digested flower made a juicy spoosh on the dust, and Mother looked sorry for not having given it a chance.
- "\"Mother's hungry, let's go, when are the reservations, who wants  brunch?"
- "\"  We gathered Mother up, all lovely leathery folds and downy hair, and rushed to the restaurant."

- Someone had suggested sushi, but since Mother always eats her food raw we eventually settled on a cakes-and-tea type place that would surely make her smile, or at least cause her to unhand her crude wooden weapon for an hour or so.

- Mother mimicked some sort of large land animal, then returned to whipping her napkin above her head in a pointedly threatening gesture to no one in particular.

- Mom pulled the napkin around her shoulders and looked the table over.

- Instead she roughly gestured at a rude hippie who turned and mouthed "burn" to all of us.

- Just  as we dug into our ginger cakes and salmon scrambles she pushed back from the table, slid the cr&ecirc;pes into a skin satchel, and crept for the door.
- |
  

- Her  small shoulders sloped into a back brittle from hunting, gathering, and birthing several millennia worth of feral mouths and unruly minds, and she was super tired.
- |
  

- Mom trekked wearily back to her cave, eons away from all of us, our joys, our jobs, our car problems and passing woes.
- |
  

- We then realized that to our mother we were but bits of meat and motive, here for a moment, then not.
- Sigh.

- Mothers.

- What are you going to do?

- We asked for more coffee and caught up like brothers and sisters have always done, exchanging mild taunts, friendly insults, and the maple syrup.

- Remember that war we started?

  "Happy Mother's Day, Mother!" we shouted, tumbling in with our splashy
  bouquets and best wishes and biggest hugs.
  Startled, our mother squatted and rooted around for a stick, then hurled it
  at us with considerable strength.  It passed clumsily by my head, followed by
  a rough bit of rock, then a shale disc that connected smartly with my
  shoulder.  Rubbing my arm and laughing, I waved off the others' help.
  "Oh, Mom," we chuckled, and implored her to get ready.  She was naked and
  filthy and had a smudgy nest of grubs on one leg that she would occasionally
  stroke with a tenderness only a mother can show.
  She had no intention of putting on a proper dress or giving up her grubs, so
  everyone stood there silently for a moment.  Suddenly, a corsage was
  proffered sweetly to the lady of the day.  Mother took the magnificent purple
  orchid with a crimson tulle border and stuffed it fully in her mouth,
  toothing at it sharply, then swallowing.  The expensive blossom stopped and
  formed a bulge in her throat.
  I then pulled out my corsage, a delicate grouping of mauve 
  carnations for the
  wrist with a handy snapback elastic band.  Mother ate the carnations as well,
  then spit them out, then finally coughed up the orchid wetly onto the ground.
    The half-digested flower made a juicy spoosh on the dust, and Mother looked
  sorry for not having given it a chance.
  "Mother's hungry, let's go, when are the reservations, who wants 
  brunch?"  We
  gathered Mother up, all lovely leathery folds and downy hair, and rushed to
  the restaurant.  Someone had suggested sushi, but since Mother always eats
  her food raw we eventually settled on a cakes-and-tea type place that would
  surely make her smile, or at least cause her to unhand her crude wooden
  weapon for an hour or so.
  Mother loved the restaurant, thank goodness.  She smelled the 
  ma&icirc;tre d' and
  found him to her liking, as she didn't deliver him a fatal blow to the
  sternum.
  The menu was marvelous and no one knew what to eat.  Some said the omelettes
  looked delicious, others thought quiche or perhaps the raspberry peach
