- Dear Sarah "Fan Girl" Williams,
- We regret to inform you that you have not been selected as a member of this year's class.
- |
  

- Being able to recite, verbatim, the lines from every Orlando Bloom movie, while impressive, is not technically a superpower.
- |
  

- Also, the fact that you are prohibited by law from coming within 10 miles of Orlando Bloom might limit our team's scope of service.
- |
  

- Thank you for your interest in Xavier's School of Exceptional Youth.
- Sincerely,  Professor X
- |
  

- Dear Adam "Gutbuster" Connors,
- We regret to inform you that you have not been selected as a member of this year's class.
- |
  

- Training to be part of the X-Men team is difficult and, unfortunately, your mutant ability to spew large amounts of mildly offensive fumes from your rectum is somewhat duplicative seeing as we have a janitor named Carl with the same&#8212; albeit involuntary &#8212;ability.
- |
  

- In addition, Wolverine can be rather ripe at times, which, in small confined spaces, might overshadow your talents.
- |
  

- Thank you for your interest in Xavier's School of Exceptional Youth.

- Dear Toby "Nose Coral" Buntings,
- We regret to inform you that you have not been selected as a member of this year's class.
- |
  

- While your ability to pull an unlimited number of sponges from your nostril is indeed special, we have not been able to discern a distinct tactical advantage to your talent.
- |
  

- On a separate note, Xavier's school is on a tight budget and our janitor, Carl, would greatly appreciate it if you could send him 30-40 sponges at your convenience.
- |
  

- Thank you for your interest in Xavier's School of Exceptional Youth.

- Dear Edgar "Boner" Yarmooth,
- We regret to inform you that you have not been selected as a member of this year's class.
- |
  

- Wielding a perpetual adamantine 2-inch erection is a most unfortunate mutant power.
- |
  

- We fear that its presence would be somewhat awkward in class and is unlikely to be useful in our battles against the Sentinels or the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.
- |
  

- Thank you for your interest in Xavier's School of Exceptional Youth.
