- Hi.
- |
  

- Good morning.
- |
  

- It's an honor and a privilege for me to be here with you today at the unveiling of this new tiger enclosure.
- Anyone who knows me knows that I thrive on challenges.
- |
  

- "When someone comes to me with a script or an idea for a movie, the first thing I ask\x97before anything else\x97is: Where's the challenge?"
- |
  

- How are we going to make this picture better than anything that's gone before?
- |
  

- How is the process of making this film going to test me and help me to grow as an artist and as a human being?
- |
  

- "\"Where's the challenge?"
- "\" Not \""
- Show me the money.
- "\" Show me the challenge!"
- |
  

- "Come on, say it with me now: Show me the challenge!"
- |
  

- "Come on, I can't hear you: SHOW."
- |
  

- ME.
- |
  

- THE.
- |
  

- CHALLENGE!
- |
  

- SHOW ME THE CHALLENGE!
- |
  

- All right!
- |
  

- Yeah!
- "Now, just as I face challenges every day to make a movie more exciting, more powerful, more entertaining, more patronizing to other cultures, so these tigers face the most difficult challenge of all in the wild: the challenge of survival."
- |
  

- But the biggest obstacle they face in trying to meet this challenge is not the human beings who shoot them with rifles and destroy their habitat.
- |
  

- No. The biggest obstacle these animals face is their own lethargy.
- "Look at these tigers here behind me\x97wasting their days, just lying in the shade."
- |
  

- Is it any wonder they're on the verge of extinction?
- |
  

- "They demonstrate a danger I think we can all fall victim to\x97that of taking the easy option, shirking the challenge, lying in the shade because we're too afraid to walk in the light."
- |
  

- In many ways, big cats are the couch potatoes of the animal kingdom.
- |
  

- They lie around, stagnating, dominated by fears and insecurities, hindered by the souls of dead aliens that possess their bodies.
- Well, I don't like couch potatoes.
- |
  

- "I don't like couches, either\x97or potatoes, for that matter."
- |
  

- I hate couches so much that when Oprah Winfrey invited me to sit on hers, I had to stand on it and jump up and down.
- |
  

- The couch is a piece of pseudofurniture that is not compatible with my moral code.
- |
  

- I'll never surrender to its corrupt agenda of relaxation.
- |
  

- I'll never let my limbs be seduced by its soft squishiness, or allow my pure life essences to trickle away down the gaps between the cushions.
- |
  

- I refuse to become a victim of laziness.
- |
  

- I won't let that happen to me, and I won't let it happen to these beautiful creatures.
- I'm here today because I want to help these tigers.
- |
  

- I want to teach them the simple systems I've learned for achieving personal goals and overcoming restrictive barriers of self-doubt.
- |
  

- For a nominal fee of $5,000 a month, I'll show the tigers processes that will enable them to positively modify their modes of perception and make real progress toward self-empowerment.
- |
  

- They'll then be able to gain the knowledge and skills they need to return to the jungle and face the threat of extinction with confidence.
- "See, I may officially be here to open this new tiger enclosure\x97but what I really want to open are the tigers' minds."
- |
  

- Open them to opportunities and inner resolve they never knew they had.
- |
  

- "Let's think about just one example: If these tigers could learn IT skills and Web design, they could publicize their own cause on the Internet and not have to rely on charities to spread awareness."
- |
  

- I can see some of you looking at me as if that's a crazy idea, right?
- |
  

- It seems so, doesn't it, with them lying there under the tree, asleep?
- |
  

- But I can teach them techniques of self-discipline and time management that will transform their learning capabilities and lead to success.
- I believe in these tigers.
- |
  

- "I believe they're capable of meeting the ultimate challenge: to survive and prosper despite the malicious influence of dead aliens."
- |
  

- Now, I don't know about you, but I'm feeling good right now.
- |
  

- I'm feeling good about the future for these tigers.
- I'm feeling pumped and excited and ready to get to work.
- |
  

- Are you with me?
- |
  

- YEAH?
- |
  

- WOO!
- |
  

- Come on!
- |
  

- Let's do some conservation!
- |
  

- Thank you very much!
