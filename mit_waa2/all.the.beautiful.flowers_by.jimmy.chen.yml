- To close your hands tightly is to be aware of them for once in your life.

- I made a fist like a dry heart.

- I was soaking wet.
- They got on the train.

- They were also soaking wet.

- It was the end of the day, and we were going home to people we were closer to.

- We would gather around words and fill in patches.
- It rained very hard.
- |
  

- Our palms got wet, so we made fists.
- |
  

- We squished fish brains and carried abalone in our pockets.
- |
  

- We kicked sea foam into the air and dodged the spray like a dumb pantomime.
- |
  

- We were soaking wet.
- I stood there like the opposite of a hug.
- |
  

- Everyone passed and left drops of rain on me.
- |
  

- I was a vertical mural with biblical scenes made out of drops.
- |
  

- The scenes eventually dried and I kept track of each vanishing figure.
- The umbrellas were black.
- |
  

- With each torrent they collapsed and folded and opened again.
- |
  

- They covered the heads of their owners and moved urgently.
- |
  

- They were held onto tightly, pulling against the wind, being pulled.
