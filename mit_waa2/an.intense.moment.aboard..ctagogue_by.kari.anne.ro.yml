- "COMMANDER: ( Ranting as he storms down a hallway."
- |
  

- The fleet has sucked on the  Galactagogue 's teat for far too long.
- "ENSIGN: ( Cornered by  COMMANDER  in same hallway."
- |
  

- I don't understand .
- |
  

- What are you saying, Commander?
- "COMMANDER: I'm saying the  Galactagogue  is drying up, Ensign."
- |
  

- So many ships suckling away at our finite supplies .
- |
  

- Our inability to have any alone time .
- |
  

- Not being able to frakkin' sleep more than two hours in a row .
- |
  

- We're done!
- "ENSIGN: But, sir, it's our job to feed and protect the fleet."
- "COMMANDER: Sure, sure, that's our job."
- |
  

- But it's time for the fleet to mature.
- |
  

- "A fleet this old is supposed to be able to go for several hours\x97frak,  all night \x97without having to hungrily call the  Galactagogue  for supplies."
- "ENSIGN: Well, you don't want the fleet to become distrustful and jaded because its supply lines were severed too soon, do you, Commander?"
- |
  

- Receiving resources from the mothership is important for the fleet's growth and development.
- |
  

- It gives the fleet confidence to grow.
- |
  

- "A nurturing environment is very importa\x97"
- "COMMANDER: And what about  our  growth, Ensign?"
- |
  

- The  Galactagogue  was made to be more than just a supply ship.
- |
  

- She enjoyed a very prestigious post before she had to take on the protection of the fleet.
- |
  

- The  Galactagogue  was a respected member of society, even.
- |
  

- She had shiny decks and launch tubes that didn't sag.
- |
  

- The  COMMANDER  heaves a large sigh.
- |
  

- She was a beautiful ship.
- "ENSIGN: She still is a beautiful ship, sir."
- |
  

- A beautiful, life-giving ship.
- |
  

- "And think about this, sir: Sooner than you think, the fleet will be on its own."
- |
  

- You'll feel wistful for these early days.
- "COMMANDER: Oh, frak you, Ensign."
- |
  

- Don't give me any of that frakkin' "the hours are long but the days are short" bullshit. There's only so much a ship can give before she needs a little shore leave. The  Galactagogue 's hoses are stretched thin. Her supplies are waning.
- "ENSIGN: I'm not sure what you want me to do, Commander."
- "COMMANDER: Just shut up and go get me some blessed-thistle tea with a side of oatmeal and fennel."
- |
  

- The  Galactagogue  will soldier on as she always has.
- "ENSIGN: Excellent, sir."
- |
  

- Right away, sir.
- "COMMANDER: And, Ensign, don't forget to grab some marshmallow root while you're\x97oh my God, what is that smell!"
- |
  

- Is it time to clean the waste-processing ship already?
- |
  

- Didn't we just  do  that?
- |
  

- Frak .
