- Dear Cable News Organizations,
- "I think you should have Ren\xE9e Zellweger killed."
- The war and the election have done much for your ratings this season, but, let's face it, after November it's back to 24-hour coverage of Laci Peterson, and frankly, that chick is played.
- |
  

- "So, you might as well kill Ren\xE9e Zellweger."
- Any story where an attractive, young, white woman is killed or goes missing is a sure-fire Nielsen favorite.
- |
  

- Throw in a celebrity&#8212;especially an Academy Award winner at the top of her game&#8212;and you can ride that starlet's corpse like a rocket sled, all the way through sweeps.
- Think of the killer demo saturation.
- |
  

- Old people love  Chicago .
- |
  

- Women 35 to 55 admire Zellweger's surly, unloved  Cold Mountain  character.
- |
  

- Women 18 to 35 identify with  Bridget Jones .
- |
  

- Men 18 to 65 want to see her naked.
- May I suggest a public kidnapping followed by a car chase, a manhunt, and an extended standoff outside some sort of creepy cabin in the woods?
- |
  

- Finally, Zellweger is shot trying to wrestle a gun away from her deranged assailant.
- |
  

- It's later announced, at the star-studded funeral, that she was pregnant.
- Finally, live via satellite, we can all watch the three-month-long trial of her captor, Catherine Zeta-Jones.
- Now that's news!
- Sincerely,
- Evan Thies
