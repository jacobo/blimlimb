- Dear Sylvie,
- I want you to look at me when we are talking, or I will not be able to shake this nagging feeling that I have to get you tested for one of those childhood attention disorders that I don&#8217;t really believe in, but can&#8217;t completely dismiss, because then I would be too much like my mother.
- Sylvie, words have meaning.
- |
  

- When I say, &#8220;Do you want grilled cheese?
- |
  

- No, I want yogurt!
- |
  

- I wanted grilled cheese!
- |
  

- As I often say to your father, you should just go ahead and use the words that mean what you want to say; it&#8217;s easier for everyone.
- My darling girl, I suspect you have a raging temper because you know deep down that you had a twin.
- |
  

- We&#8217;ll never know for sure, because although my French is very good, I didn&#8217;t understand everything the gynecologist said when I had the emergency sonogram in France.
- |
  

- I did, however, note that the whole visit cost only seventy-five dollars.
- |
  

- You definitely can&#8217;t get a full pelvic and a scrapbook full of sonogram pictures for that in the U.S.
- |
  

- That makes me mad, too.
- One more thing.
- |
  

- I understand that you would rather do your &#8220;poop checks&#8221; (where you strain your abdominals as a warm-up exercise for the big event) sitting on a chair, because your feet fall asleep when you sit on the potty too long.
- |
  

- However, it is disconcerting to see you drop your fork, turn red, and groan in the middle of dinner.
- |
  

- On the other hand, it beats your old method of crouching behind the sofa and going in your pants.
- |
  

- Good point.
- I take it all back.
- |
  

- You&#8217;re doing fine.
- Love,
- Mom

  Dear Sylvie,
  I want you to look at me when we are talking, or I will not be able to shake this nagging feeling that I have to get you tested for one of those childhood attention disorders that I don&#8217;t really believe in, but can&#8217;t completely dismiss, because then I would be too much like my mother.
  Sylvie, words have meaning. When I say, &#8220;Do you want grilled cheese?&#8221; and you say, &#8220;No, I want yogurt!&#8221; and then, upon seeing the yogurt, you scream, &#8220;I wanted grilled cheese!,&#8221; you are denying the essential nature of communication. As I often say to your father, you should just go ahead and use the words that mean what you want to say; it&#8217;s easier for everyone.
  My darling girl, I suspect you have a raging temper because you know deep down that you had a twin. We&#8217;ll never know for sure, because although my French is very good, I didn&#8217;t understand everything the gynecologist said when I had the emergency sonogram in France. I did, however, note that the whole visit cost only seventy-five dollars. You definitely can&#8217;t get a full pelvic and a scrapbook full of sonogram pictures for that in the U.S. That makes me mad, too.
  One more thing.
