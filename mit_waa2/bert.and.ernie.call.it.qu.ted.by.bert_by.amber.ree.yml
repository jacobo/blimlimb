- I mean prairie dog.
- ERNIE
- Why did we never have any pets?
- BERT
- Why did you take the knob off the radio and turn me down?
- |
  

- We had no pets because you used my cowboy hat for a goldfish bowl once, and the goldfish got ideas.
- ERNIE
- It's funny you should say that.

- Last night I dreamt there were monkeys in the bed and elephants in my chest of drawers and I gazed at them minutely through my trusty, rusty telescope.
