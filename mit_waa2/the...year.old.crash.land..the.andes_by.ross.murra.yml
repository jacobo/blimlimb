  Day 1
  Regain consciousness inside wreckage. Crawl on hands and knees over bodies to escape twisted, half-buried fuselage. Crawl back inside fuselage to retrieve favorite stuffed friend, Mr. Mookie.

  Miguel begins erecting a shelter from pieces of strewn sheet metal. Get excited about playing house and call dibs on being the "daddy."
