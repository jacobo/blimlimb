- "SEEMINGLY UNRELIABLE NARRATOR:  Is it true that Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down?"
- "WEEBLES REPRESENTATIVE:  Yes."
- "SUN:  Does that mean they simply choose not to fall down, or that it is  impossible for them to fall down?"
- "WR:  It is impossible for Weebles to fall down."
- |
  

- And since Weebles are not living things, it is also impossible for them to choose to do anything.
- "SUN:  Weebles aren't alive?"
- |
  

- But what about those creepy eyes?
- "WR:  While Weeble artisans make a concerted effort to create a lifelike appearance on each and every Weeble, I can assure you that your Weebles are not alive."
- "SUN:  But&#151;"
- "WR:  Seriously, they're not alive."
- |
  

- Get a grip.
- "SUN:  Okay, can we back up a little bit?"
- |
  

- Because I'm getting confused.
- |
  

- Weebles fall down, but they don't wobble?
- |
  

- Is that it?
- "WR:  No, no, no."
- |
  

- This is not difficult.
- |
  

- They wobble, and do not fall down.
- |
  

- How many times do I have to say it?
- "SUN:  Well, wait a minute now."
- |
  

- I stuck a Weeble into some Silly Putty, and now it's lying down.
- |
  

- What do you have to say to that?
- "WR:  Just because a Weeble is lying down does not mean that it fell down."
- |
  

- Lying down is something one does on purpose, while falling down is accidental.
- "SUN:  But how can Weebles do anything on purpose if they're not alive?"
- "WR:  Hey."
- |
  

- That was just a figure of speech.
- "SUN:  Okay, I'm dropping a Weeble off the edge of the Grand Canyon."
- |
  

- I think now you have to admit that it's falling, don't you?
- "WR:  Ah, well, now you're just taking advantage of the broader range of connotations of \"fall\" vis-&agrave;-vis the comparatively narrow definition of \"fall down\"."
- |
  

- Perhaps this is a slightly abstruse semantic point, but while one can not fall down without falling, it is possible to fall without falling down, if you catch my drift.
- "SUN:  Well, being seemingly unreliable, I don't quite follow you there, but let's move on anyway."
- |
  

- What is inside a Weeble?
- "WR:  Just plastic."
- |
  

- Oh, and a single pellet of a mysterious superheavy compound from a faraway planet that fell to earth in a giant meteorite, of course.
- "SUN:  While I've got you here, you don't know what happened to my cat, do you?"
- |
  

- It was in the bedroom the last time I looked.
- "WR:  Well, the Weebles didn't eat it, that's for sure!"
- |
  

- Because they're not alive.
- |
  

- Ha ha.
- |
  

- Really.
- |
  

- Not.
- |
  

- Can't stress that enough.
- |
  

- I have to go now.
