  Of all the movies starring everyone on the American Film Institute's
  top 50 list, my favorite is the 1949 classic "Our Mister Collins." John
  Wayne (#13, actors list) is a fast-talking reporter at a big city paper who
  gets into shouting matches with his feisty editor (Mary Pickford, actress
  list #24).  Rumor has it the governer (Elizabeth Taylor, #7) got caught by
  his wife (Burt Lancaster #19) in a hotel love nest with a young clerk 
  (Humphrey Bogart, #1). To beat his prissy co-worker (Marlon Brando, #4) to
  the scoop, John Wayne meets wise-cracking cops (Grace Kelly, #13; Lillian
  Gish #17; and Sophia Loren #21) at the racetrack.  A shoeshine kid (Greta
  Garbo, #5) and a newspaper stand vendor (Gary Cooper, #11) also give him 
  the skinny on the scandal. The hotel manager (Shirley Temple, #18) hints 
  that the whole town is afraid of Big Bernstein (Ava Gardner, #25) who needs
  the governer to stay in her pocket for the election against opponent Gene
  Kelly (#15).
  Meanwhile, John Wayne has an overbearing mother (James Dean, #18) and 
  her snobby opera-society friends (Spencer Tracy #9, Mae West, #15, and Henry
  Fonda, #6)telling him to take up polo like his brother, Sidney Poitier
  (#22). Dad (Ginger Rogers, #14) just swipes martinis off the tray from the
  butler (Ingrid Bergman, #4) who ogles the maid (James Cagney, #8).
  John Wayne is engaged to a sweet, bumbling veterinarian (Edward G.
  Robinson, #24). During witty banter with the sandwich delivery boy (Orson
  Welles, #16) in the newsroom, in walks John Wayne's first wife, Laurence 
  Olivier! (#14!) Laurence has Gregory Peck (#12) wrapped around his arm,
  giggling and in a cheap hat. John Wayne gets jealous. Gregory Peck, though,
  flirts with the cigar-chomping gangster (Audrey Hepburn, #3) at the
  nightclub they all go to.
  The gangster's girl is sultry torch singer William Holden (#25) doing  "A
  Blue, Crazy Kind of Feeling (Could it Be Love? No, No)" Film buffs will spot
  cameos by Clark Gable (#7) as a bus boy, Lauren Bacall (#20) and Buster
  Keaton (#21) as drunken Shriners, and Katharine Hepburn (#1) playing a mean
  saxophone. Is the third chorus girl in the big "South of the Border" number
  Joan Crawford (#10) or Kirk Douglas (#17)? The sombrero is just too big.
  The bouncer (Fred Astaire, #5) kicks out the gang and they take a taxi
  (driven by The Marx Brothers, #20) back to the newspaper. The security guard
  (Marlene Dietrich, #9) says Brando just wrote the governer expose for
  tomorrow's edition! The cleaning lady (Bette Davis, #2, doing a wonderful
  African-American impression) mentions Bernstein called Brando earlier and
  they sounded "real chummy-like."
  Everyone dashes to the elevator, where John Wayne and Laurence Olivier
  are closely squished together. Robert Mitchum (#23) gets on with a poodle,
  then Judy Garland (#8) carrying a safe, then Vivien Leigh (#16) and Carole
  Lombard (#23) and Charlie Chaplin (#10), and finally Marilyn Monroe (#6)  in
  unattractive shoes. The doorman (Jean Harlow, #22) says to the homeless guy
  (Barbara Stanwyck, #11) when the gang rushes out, "Now how about that?"
  Getting past Big Bernstein's gun-toting goons, James Stewart (#3),
  Claudette Colbert (#12) and Rita Hayworth (#19), isn't easy, but it turns
  out they love puppy dogs, supplied by Edward G. Robinson who arrives on the
  scene and re-wins John Wayne's love. The wise-cracking cops arrest Big
  Bernstein on some vague charge. Everyone laughs. Cary Grant (#2) walks by.
  The end.
