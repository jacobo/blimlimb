- Talk about a true believer.

- I rode on an airplane with him once, and he wouldn't start eating his meal until everyone was served.
- "Sheila, Goofus's high-school classmate:"
- My memory of Goofus is that people saw what they wanted to.
- |
  

- I was drawn to him because I sensed he was hurting inside.
- |
  

- That's why he put up that wall and was "rude," but who's to say which way is right? It's just a social construct. Is there some cosmic, universal book of manners? I knew they'd find a way to make him pay, though. They always do.
- "Ronald, middle-school classmate of both:"
- It was weird; they started at our school at the exact same time.

- Eighth grade.

- I could tell he had picked up his Nietzscheism from a comic book.
- |
  

- He would talk about the "Will to Power.
- "\" But there was also some G. Gordon Liddy mixed in there."
- |
  

- He loved doing the candle trick, moving his hand through the flame and pretending he didn't mind the pain.
- |
  

- Then I did the same thing with my finger, showing him how full of shit he was.
- "Natalie, Gallant's high-school friend:"
- Gallant was one of the few mature guys in our high school.
- |
  

- Sensitive.
- |
  

- We used to talk about James Taylor during lunch.
- |
  

- I thought him the perfect gentleman, and of course my parents loved him.
- |
  

- But when someone is polite to the point of having that Moonie quality, it gets to you.
- |
  

- Finally it dawned on me that he used that politeness as a way of controlling me.
- |
  

- That was what it was all about&#8212;he followed the rules because it gave him the advantage.
- "Alex, high-school teacher of Goofus:"
- Goofus had a top-notch bullshit detector.
- |
  

- Most teenagers think they have one, but his was the real thing, and I'm one of the few teachers who can relate to it.
- |
  

- I introduced him to Kerouac, Bukowski, Burroughs.
- |
  

- He acted enthusiastic about writing a paper in which they interacted.
- |
  

- But it turned out to be seven pages of .
- |
  

- I was one of the characters in the scene, which was extremely graphic and not what we agreed on.
- "Paul, Gallant's college acquaintance:"
- Gallant just didn't get it when it came to relating to people.
- |
  

- He would say words the "proper" way that no one normal ever does&#8212;you know, "Don't act immatoor.
- "\" Always the authority."
- |
  

- One night I'm walking to dinner with him and another student, a friend from England, and we're ragging on each other&#8212;he's calling me Yank and I'm calling him Limey.
- |
  

- Gallant breaks in to inform us that "
- Limey" comes from the British navy, eating limes to avoid scurvy, blah, blah, blah.
- |
  

- Gee, thanks, Gallant.
- |
  

- Dork.
- "Brandon, junior-college classmate of Goofus:"
- Was Goofus a rebel?
- |
  

- He sure liked to think so.
- |
  

- He cultivated that tousled-hair thing.
- |
  

- He wouldn't go out unless he thought it was prominent enough.
- |
  

- I sat in his living room for 45 minutes once waiting for him to sculpt it into the perfect unkempt shape.
- |
  

- But that roughness was skin deep.
- |
  

- I knew he'd be easy pickings in a real fight.
- "Dan, Gallant's college acquaintance:"
- Gallant would walk into a party and suck all the air out of the room.
- |
  

- He would pretend not to be disapproving but he always made a point of commenting on what you were drinking, or how many you had.
- |
  

- "\"You must really like that kind of beer\""
- |
  

- "Darlene, ex-wife of Goofus:"
- I thought I could change Goofus.
- |
  

- Remember, I'm a town girl who's never gone anywhere, and I was looking for some excitement.
- |
  

- I had a lot to learn about men.
- |
  

- With that electronic ankle bracelet, he couldn't leave the house after dark, so it was always me doing the shopping and running last-minute errands.
- |
  

- And through all that he was always talking about how oppressed he was.
- |
  

- Try raising three kids when your husband won't get off his ass.
- "Steve, Gallant's college acquaintance:"
- Gallant's attempts to seem cool were just painful.
- |
  

- One time after making some incredibly lame joke he said, "I'm just breaking your balls," and the rest of us almost died laughing.
- "Shane, Goofus's army buddy:"
- Goofus loved Jack Daniels.
- |
  

- And Yukon Jack.
- |
  

- He always wanted to do snakebites even though I don't think he liked them&#8212;just the name.
- |
  

- He would do two and then switch to something else.
- "Brad, Gallant's co-worker:"
- Gallant was the total company man.
- |
  

- There's not a buzzword he didn't use to death.
- |
  

- We're at a strategy meeting one day and he actually says, "If you  fail  to  plan  you  plan  to  fail .
- "\" I had to avoid making eye contact with Tony, another co-worker, because I knew we would both lose it and get in trouble."
- "Reverend John Swafford, Gallant's minister:"
- Gallant was a wonderful addition to our church.
- |
  

- He always showed tremendous concern for the members, making inquiries and then letting me know which ones seemed to be having personal problems.
- |
  

- If he had just had a little more concern for himself, things would not have turned out the way they did.
- "Harold, charity-event organizer:"
- What happened was a disgrace.
- |
  

- I put together nice events with the right kinds of people attending.
- |
  

- I don't need this kind of publicity.
- "David, Gallant's co-worker:"
- I don't really understand what pushed Gallant over the edge.
- |
  

- Serving from the right rather than the left&#8212;who even pays attention to that stuff?
- |
  

- Especially at a fundraiser.
- |
  

- I think Gallant must have been on something.
- |
  

- There's a side of him nobody knows.
- |
  

- It's weird how everything came full circle, though.
- |
  

- It was fate Goofus got assigned to serve that table.
- "Dean, fellow waiter with Goofus:"
- Goofus told me in the kitchen he had a bad feeling about that night.
- |
  

- It was weird because he's not usually superstitious.
- |
  

- I was still in there putting garnishes on the plates when I heard the altercation&#8212;I just thought someone was getting chewed out for dropping a tray.
- "David, deputy mayor:"
- I was at the next table.
- |
  

- Everything is normal.
- |
  

- The waiters are bringing the entrees out and whisking the salads away.
- |
  

- Suddenly, this nice-looking man at their table explodes in rage.
- |
  

- He screams out, "Right is wrong!
- "\" several times at this poor server who's looking at him in shock."
- |
  

- Before anyone can move he puts one hand on top of the server's head, the other on his jaw, and just snaps his neck, Delta Force-style.
- |
  

- Then he sat back down and put his napkin in his lap.
- "Evan, Gallant's co-worker:"
- I was sitting across from Gallant.
- |
  

- Goofus was baiting him&#8212;he was looking right at me with this smirk on his face while he set the plate down.
- |
  

- Well, he got a reaction all right.
- |
  

- I hope Goofus is happy wherever he is&#8212;where exactly do scum go when they die?
- "George, Gallant's co-worker:"
- Wow&#8212;a life sentence.
- |
  

- Normally, I'd say Gallant won't last a week on the inside.
- |
  

- But I definitely can imagine him being very helpful to some inmate, if you get me.
- "Harold, cemetery custodian:"
- Goofus's tombstone is not marked well and is hard to find, but the teenage kids have started making pilgrimages to it.
- |
  

- They go there and get drunk and weepy.
- |
  

- I find their beer cans and wine bottles along with flowers and notes saying stuff like "You spoke the truth and they killed you for it.
- "\" I'm thinking: You want to make him out to be your hero, go crazy, I don't care."
- |
  

- Just don't leave your crap all over the ground for me to clean up.
- |
  

- Didn't anybody ever teach these kids manners?
