- Today's my day off.

  Guy from Channel Five: Hi, Jim? Jim Barach, from channel five.
  Guy from Channel Nine: Oh, hi, how are you?
  [Jim Teske (Ch. 9) and Jim Barach (Ch. 5) shake hands, while I stand
  between them.]
  Five: Not bad, not bad. How are things with you?
  Nine: Things are pretty quiet today. Pretty quiet. Today's my day off.
  Five: Hey, I know how that goes.
  ...
  Five: I'm heading in now. I just got a call that there was a fire at
  Unisys. Now they're having trouble downloading any new satellite images.
  I

  Five: Jim, does your dad own a clothing store?
  Nine: Yeah, uh, it's over on--
  Five: That's what I thought! I thought your dad owned a clothing store.
  I've been in there. I've seen him.
  Nine: Really? He never mentioned it to me. He knows everyone who comes
