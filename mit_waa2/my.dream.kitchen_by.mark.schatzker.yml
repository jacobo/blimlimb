  "I want my dream kitchen to be industrial." &#151;girlfriend
  My dream kitchen will be industrial. It will have bright, wide open spaces
  framed by exposed pipes and a concrete, no-nonsense floor. The counters and
  door will be made of stainless steel. A drain installed in the center of the
  floor will allow you to hose down the whole place.
  My dream kitchen will be very industrial. You will be able to walk into the
  fridge. The dishwasher, also stainless steel, will remove the toughest
  baked-on grit from oversized pans and baking sheets. Smoked-glass windows
  will stretch from the ceiling to the floor. Everything will be so large that
  a person could soak comfortably in the sink alongside the carrots and
  potatoes.
  The countertops in my dream kitchen will have sharp, fearsome corners,
  industrial enough to cause goring. A black barrel full of toxic chemicals
  will sit in the far corner, and the ventilation ducts will be caked with
  hazardous dust. When they tear down my dream kitchen, the soil beneath will
  be poisonous, having marinated for decades in leeched contaminants.
  Pregnant women living within a ten-mile radius of my dream kitchen will have
  grossly abnormal babies. People two hundred miles away will blame my dream
  kitchen for acid rain.
  My dream kitchen will be a closed shop. To cook in it you will have to
  belong to a union.
  My dream kitchen will be so industrial that it will be in constant danger of
  being moved to a border town in Mexico. On weekends children will come to
  play in my dream kitchen and wind up impaled on machinery they cannot
  comprehend. Old men will drive by with their grandsons and point and say, "I
  spent 35 years of my life in there. 35 years...."
  My dream kitchen will feature industrial-scale accidents. Whole limbs will
  be cut off, accidentally. A man will walk into the fridge and be overcome by
  fumes. Another will hear a munching, gurgling sound and feel an odd sinking
  sensation before discovering that he is standing in the garbage disposal. A
  sign boasting of so many days since our last accident will never reach
  double digits. The grandfathers who point and say, "35 years..." will all
  die of terrible, incurable diseases, but the ensuing class action suit will
  be thwarted by a crack team of industrial lawyers in the employ of my dream
