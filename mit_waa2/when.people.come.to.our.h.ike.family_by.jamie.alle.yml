- Joe!
- |
  

- Come in!
- |
  

- I'm so glad you could visit away from the office.
- |
  

- We were just sitting down for a little television.
- |
  

- Please, join us.
- |
  

- Don't sit there.
- |
  

- That's my seat.
- |
  

- No one sits in my seat unless I specifically say to sit in my seat.
- |
  

- How many times do I have to tell you this?
- |
  

- Sit on the floor.
- |
  

- What, you're too good to sit on the floor?
- |
  

- You know what, Joe, please quit talking so much.
- |
  

- We don't sit down in front of the television just so we can miss what is being said on the television.
- |
  

- That's sort of stupid, don't you think?
- |
  

- I can't hear.
- |
  

- Where's the remote?
- |
  

- Joe, get up and turn up the sound.
- |
  

- What do you mean, no?
- |
  

- No, what?
- |
  

- No, I don't want to get in trouble?
- |
  

- Too late.
- |
  

- Go to your room .
- |
  

- What's gotten into Joe?
- |
  

- Mary!
- |
  

- Come in!
- |
  

- Joanne, Mary from the school is here!
- |
  

- She's dressed like a slut!
- |
  

- We're just sitting down for dinner, Mary.
- |
  

- Wash your hands first, please.
- |
  

- It's disgusting that you even consider eating after the places your hands have been.
- |
  

- Bathroom?
- |
  

- Who am I&#8212;God?
- |
  

- I don't need to know about your bowel movements.
- |
  

- Make sure you wash your hands again when you're done .
- |
  

- Mary!
- |
  

- How long are you going to be in there?
- |
  

- Your dinner is getting cold!
- |
  

- I'm not going to microwave your dinner!
- |
  

- Don't complain that it's cold!
- |
  

- And I want you to eat every single bite!
- |
  

- What's taking you so long in there?
- |
  

- Fired?
- |
  

- Mike, I'm sorry, did you say you've been fired from your job?
- |
  

- And you want some sympathy from me, your neighbor?
- |
  

- Let me ask you something&#8212;are you ever going to grow up?
- |
  

- What did you do to get fired?
- |
  

- Did you have sex with the cashier?
- |
  

- Oh, God.
- |
  

- Joanne!
- |
  

- Come in here!
- |
  

- Mike got fired for nailing the cashier again.
- |
  

- Don't try to deny it.
- |
  

- If anyone knows when you're lying, Mike, it's me!
- |
  

- He should be in therapy, Joanne!
- |
  

- You should be in therapy, Mike!
- |
  

- Joanne thinks you should be in therapy!
- |
  

- At the very least, restriction.
- |
  

- Give us your car keys.
- |
  

- If you can't keep a job, then you certainly can't handle the responsibility of a two-ton car.
- |
  

- Sara, I hate you.
- |
  

- Yes, as my mail carrier, you bring my bills and send my letters.
- |
  

- But I've been talking with my therapist and we've determined that you are the source of all my problems.
- |
  

- It all goes back to you&#8212;the way you treated me then, the way you treat me now, the way you always seem too busy to address any extra needs I might dare to have.
- |
  

- And I hate you.
- |
  

- I hate you!
- |
  

- I hate you, I hate you!
- |
  

- I'll never forgive you!
- |
  

- Can I have some money for the movies?
- |
  

- Jim, it's good that you could visit this weekend for the reunion.
- |
  

- It's been a long time since we palled around in high school, eh?
- |
  

- Those were the days.
- |
  

- And I'm glad you're staying the night.
- |
  

- Are you comfortable in my bed?
- |
  

- Good&#8212;now give me a kiss.
- |
  

- Jim, don't do that.
- |
  

- It hurts my feelings when you turn away.
- |
  

- Are you mad at me?
- |
  

- Are you mad that I yelled at you during dinner?
- |
  

- Or is it because I embarrassed you in front of your little friends?
- |
  

- You can't be this sensitive.
- |
  

- Life is hard, Jim.
- |
  

- I do these things to help you.
- |
  

- You mean everything to me.
- |
  

- Now give me a kiss.
- |
  

- I love you.
- |
  

- Good night.
- |
  

- And first thing tomorrow morning, don't forget to iron my shirt.
