- Genghis Khan
- It was another one of those nights.
- |
  

- He got up and walked out of the yurt.
- |
  

- Genghis surveyed his army's camp in the chilly predawn air.
- |
  

- He could not concentrate.
- |
  

- His stomach felt like it was the setting of a fierce, explosive battle.
- |
  

- He resolved then and there to refrain from eating large meals so late at night.
- |
  

- It was bad this time.
- |
  

- He felt like he might vomit, but, then again, he might not.
- |
  

- There was no sense in ordering his shaman to administer treatment at this point.
- |
  

- It was going to be a long, restless night, he figured, and belched, staring past the yurts at the expansive plains of northern China.
- Napoleon
- He ripped the cushions off the chaise longue and threw them on the floor.
- |
  

- What a disaster this was.
- |
  

- A half hour ago, Napoleon had been ceremonially presented with the keys to Vienna.
- |
  

- His army had captured the old capital two days earlier and he had been in a great mood.
- |
  

- How things had changed.
- |
  

- He would look like a fool if he didn't have the keys at the afternoon reception.
- |
  

- Thus, he couldn't leave the palace until he had them, nor could he tell his aides he'd lost them, because it would be a disgrace, and so his many responsibilities were put on hold until this embarrassing inconvenience was settled.
- |
  

- He tried to retrace his steps.
- |
  

- Where had he placed them last?
- |
  

- It was no use!
- |
  

- He'd spitefully thrown them at some peacocks that had crossed his path outside, but he'd put them in his coat immediately after.
- |
  

- They had to be there somewhere .
- |
  

- "Cort\xE9s"
- Man, was it hot.
- |
  

- "As Cort\xE9s trudged through the jungle, he suddenly threw his hands up in disgust."
- |
  

- He realized that he had spilled wine on his shirt at lunch and it was going to be stained.
- |
  

- He reflected that it was just a shirt, but, still, this was one of his last remaining nice shirts.
- |
  

- The rest had been splattered with blood, ripped, or burned, and now this one was as good as ruined, too!
- |
  

- He just could not believe it.
- |
  

- He contemplated scrubbing it that night at camp.
- |
  

- "But, no, the stain was set\x97it would be futile."
- |
  

- He would have to discard the shirt that night.
- |
  

- He'd look like a fool going about in stained clothes.
- |
  

- Maybe one of his men would lend him something to wear.
- Attila the Hun
- It was starting to get late.
- |
  

- Attila ordered his general to begin preparations for setting up camp and calling it a day.
- |
  

- As he did so, he accidentally bit into the soft flesh of his inner cheek.
- |
  

- He could taste blood.
- |
  

- It stung horribly.
- |
  

- He'd been biting that cheek all day.
- |
  

- He turned away so his pain and frustration would go unperceived by his inferior.
- |
  

- He got off his horse and walked down a dirt path to analyze the terrain.
- |
  

- His thoughts drifted and he began lamenting that, with the current swelling, he would begin biting his cheek more and more.
- |
  

- Would this painful irritation never end?
