  NOTES ON OUR TRAVELS
  We got bored, me and the adult population, recently, and
  so went to look for our schoolteacher from back in school,
  who had been bald. He paid for medicine to grow hair, but
  didn't grow hair. Blood came from his head, instead, in
  strands. Which was close enough for him. We didn't find
  him. But we saw other things.
  In Carmen Miranda, California, we visited the publicly
  funded Foundation for Entropic Research, where
  government scientists allowed us to watch them as they
  worked. It reminded us in some ways of the time we had
  breakfast with a bunch of vacationing sea otters, in
  Phoenix, in 1972. It was hot like a son-of-a-bitch, real hot.
  Not for the otters. They never even blinked at it, just kept
  at the bar, sucking down Bellinis. Anyway. We learned
  things during our visit to the government facility, is what
  happened. Here is a report on the things we learned.
  The hitting-stuff-with-crowbars project was fascinating to
  view, dozens of pot-bellied little white-coats charging up
  on office chairs and fresh fruit, taking turns grunting
  furious blows to the tops bottoms and sides of things and
  rubbing their chins with clinical amazement as it all burst,
  collapsed, and exploded into forms that were different
  than the original forms. We asked one scientist what he
  had learned so far, but it was too early to tell, so he
  couldn't speculate. He did say, though, that he noticed the
  way money affected things, particularly in stores.
  The psychological interview project was very good, too.
  When we went a somber team of researchers were
  gathered around a weeping elderly gentleman, rapid-fire
  asking a stream of questions about such subjects as the
  death of his spouse, the deaths of his children, his career
  failures, and his history of childhood abuse. The tears of
  the subject seemed to support the theory of team members
  that "things just keep getting worse," but here again no
  one was saying, yet. We had to hand it to those
  government scientists. They were thorough, that's for sure.
  Later, the same man was the subject of a study in which

  referring to him.
  Dr. Behan was a quiet man, except that he talked a lot and
  also banged on the table with his fists. His fists were
  bigger than ours, which you have to respect to a degree.
  "Dr. Behan," we asked, "how is the research into entropy
  going?"
  "It's falling apart," he said, which he seemed to regard as a
  breakthrough in and of itself. Interesting how when you
  study collapse and destruction, failure seems to take on a
  new meaning. Of course, we're not a clinician.
  Afterward, we continued along the highway to Slipshod,
  California, the railroad derailment capital of the world.
  Slipshod is unusual in that the shoes of the locals are
  tarnished with the mysterious sludge that oozes from
  every natural and artificial surface within city limits. The
  locals dislike the sludge as such, but enjoy the way in
  which it sets them apart from the neighboring area, the
