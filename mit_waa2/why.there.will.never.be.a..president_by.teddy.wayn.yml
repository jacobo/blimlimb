  At the first presidential debate, Brian Williams tosses me the classic are-you-a-populist-or-not? softball, which my aides somehow didn't prepare me for: \"What's the price of a gallon of milk?\" I hedge by asking, \"Regular or soy?\" and quickly provide the correct amount for unsweetened soy at Whole Foods ($1.99 per quart), but the scornful looks in the crowd confirm that I've already been cast as an effete, unelectable Northeastern liberal. John Edwards nails the right answer and pours himself a tall, victorious glass from his pitcher of 2 percent.\n\
