- That old fashioned loom -- Hitler loved to loom -- in the corner has the teeth marks of a madman, and behind that, are some really sharp knives.

- Indeed, here in the garage one can't help but get a sense of just how creative a man Hitler really was, and, while at Berchtesgaden at least, how happy and at ease.

- Thanks once again for coming.

  Selections from the audiotape accompanying the walking tour of
  "Berchtesgaden: Hitler's Summer Retreat":
  "Welcome to Berchtesgaden, Hitler's fabulous place in the country.
  Naturally, the F&#252;hrer had his own special nickname for his beloved
  retreat, an Austrian folk expression that translates roughly to: "All
  the small birds are dead now." Yes, Hitler loved folk expressions. And
  hated birds. [Pause] Stand straight! [Pause] the F&#252;hrer would arrive
