- |
  

- She's just pretending not to notice.
- |
  

- Don't know.
- |
  

- Maybe she did it subconsciously?
- |
  

- She wants you back.
- |
  

- She feels what you feel and doesn't know how to express it either.
- |
  

- You can learn together.
- |
  

- Maybe.
- |
  

- No, she did it on purpose.
- |
  

- She's probably just teasing you.
- |
  

- Probably.
- |
  

- No, she wouldn't do that.
- |
  

- Maybe she did it to tease you but forgot how much it would hurt you and regretted it immediately.
- |
  

- Maybe.
- |
  

- Why would she do that?
- |
  

- To give herself an ego boost.
- |
  

- Always liked to see you suffer.
- |
  

- Because she can and she knows you can't do anything about it.
- |
  

- Not can't.
- |
  

- Won't.
- |
  

- Don't know.
- |
  

- Her leg is still touching yours.
- |
  

- Ooh!
- |
  

- She's evil.
- |
  

- She probably thinks it's just the table leg.
- |
  

- Don't know.
- |
  

- Now she's waggling it up and down.
- |
  

- Oh my God.
- |
  

- She's evil.
- |
  

- She definitely thinks it's just the table leg.
- |
  

- It's more of a nervous tremble than a waggle.
- |
  

- Should you move your leg away?
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- Yes, but it feels so good.
- |
  

- Maybe.
- |
  

- Just don't know.
- |
  

- She probably doesn't even notice.
- |
  

- She has to notice.
- |
  

- Move it anyway, to show that you're being considerate, even if she doesn't  notice.
- |
  

- But wouldn't moving it make her notice your legs were touching and then she  might think that you put your leg there on purpose?
- |
  

- Grah!
- |
  

- Don't know!
- |
  

- Isn't that a little weird that you want to keep your leg touching hers?
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- YES.
- |
  

- She smells amazing.
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- But is it really weird?
- |
  

- You're a human being after all.
- |
  

- Yeah, but aren't we supposed to be more civilized?
- |
  

- Tactile comfort is essential according to Harry Harlow.
- |
  

- Yes and barely.
- |
  

- Don't frickin' know.
- |
  

- Why isn't she making eye contact?
- |
  

- She notices your dumb leg.
- |
  

- Because you've been thinking about your dumb leg instead of talking to her.
- |
  

- You're ugly.
- |
  

- Honestly, at this point you need to get your life in order before worrying about small things like that.
- |
  

- She's probably thinking about someone else.
- |
  

- Definitely.
- |
  

- Someone better than you.
