- AP News Service
- WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer advocates urged the government today to immediately recall a clot-busting drug called Abbokinase because manufacturing violations mean it could be contaminated with such infections as hepatitis.
- The Food and Drug Administration already has warned of the potential infection risk.
- |
  

- Last month, the agency urged doctors to use the numerous other clot-busters sold instead, and to consider Abbokinase a last resort.
- |
  

- Although that's not an absolute guarantee, the FDA let sales resume late last month once manufacturer Abbott Inc.
- |
  

- The consumer group Public Citizen charged today that FDA ignored its own inspectors' recommendations to seize $100 million worth of Abbokinase and the raw materials used to make it -- kidney cells from dead babies imported from Colombia.
- The group called for an FDA investigation into the "extremely suspicious circumstances" in which Maryland-based BioWhittaker Inc. obtained the kidney tissue it sold to Abbott. Inspection reports say the tissue was obtained without proper screening to ensure the babies and their mothers were healthy.
- "A:  I do not know the details of this flap and I once worked for a company that was the predecessor organization to BioWhittaker, so I am not comfortable getting into this in depth."

- "Let me ask you a question: Do you think we should hold people responsible for not meeting standards that were not standards when they didn't meet them?"
- |
  

- I didn't think so.
- The business about parts from dead babies is crap.
- |
  

- They are talking about fetal tissues.
- |
  

- This argument has gone on for decades.
- |
  

- No one in this country is stealing dead babies (or live ones) from Colombia or from anywhere else.
- |
  

- This is the worst sort of rumor-mongering.
- |
  

- There are no "abortion clinics" in Latin America where U.S. personnel are stationed in waiting. The term "miscarriage" is used when God performs an abortion.
- |
  

- This happens, usually for good genetic reason (He is, after all, God, and He knows what He is doing).
- |
  

- No reason to waste tissue that could be put to good use.
- On the other hand, who knows what viruses these tissues contain?
- |
  

- Maybe the presence of a virus was the reason for the miscarriage.
- |
  

- Do the tissues contain an undetectable leukemia virus?
- |
  

- The list goes on.
- |
  

- It's an imperfect world.

- |
  

- All I have done is find things no one ever found before.
- |
  

- Anyone could do it.
- |
  

- Go into the woods behind your house and find a plant that doesn't look good; one with a streak on the leaf or a curled leaf or something else odd.
- |
  

- You will probably isolate a virus from that plant, one that has not been isolated before.
- |
  

- Go to a swamp and fish out some invertebrates; you will likely find a new virus or parasite in them.
- |
  

- These things are all over the place.

- We don't notice them until they make themselves know or until we actually look for them.
- "Q:  Will humanity ever be free of disease?"

- |
  

- I don't know anything about non-infectious diseases, except Raiders' fans.
- |
  

- In any event, I don't think so.
- |
  

- First of all, I do not think we can beat the bacteria and other disease organisms at their own game.
- |
  

- They were here before we arrived and they will be here after we are long gone.
- |
  

- "\"Infectious disease\""
- |
  

- It is really only the rare host that gets sick.
- |
  

- Most of the time we seem to get along with our parasites or to kick them out.
- |
  

- When we lose the battle it is a big time result.
- |
  

- Disease is a part of the human condition.
- |
  

- I could theorize about a time far into the future when all the survivors of all the diseases would have built themselves genetic walls and are no longer susceptible to such organisms.
- |
  

- Problem is the little beasts will only mutate and get around the walls.
- |
  

- All we can do is try to keep our heads above water on this one.

  CONSUMER GROUP CALLS FOR CLOT-BUSTER RECALL

  infection risk. Last month, the agency urged doctors to use the numerous
  other clot-busters sold instead, and to consider Abbokinase a last
  resort. Although that's not an absolute guarantee, the FDA let sales
  resume late last month once manufacturer Abbott Inc. had upgraded its
  safety methods to guard against future problems.
  The consumer group Public Citizen charged today that FDA ignored its

  not comfortable getting into this in depth. Let me ask you a question:
  Do you think we should hold people responsible for not meeting standards
  that were not standards when they didn't meet them? I didn't think so.
  The business about parts from dead babies is crap. They are talking

  nano-technology?
  A:  What does a football coach know about molecular biology?

  other disease organisms at their own game. They were here before we
  arrived and they will be here after we are long gone. "Infectious
  disease" is the end-product of an attempt by a microscopic organism to
  find a good place to live, a place where there is food and other good
  conditions. It is really only the rare host that gets sick. Most of the
  time we seem to get along with our parasites or to kick them out. When
  we lose the battle it is a big time result. Disease is a part of the
