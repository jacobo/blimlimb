- Some time ago, Peter McGrath and Jenny Traig, cousins, left their jobs to become self-declared shut-ins.
- |
  

- They quickly discovered that even the shut-in's life is full of social encounters and mysteries, and no mystery is greater than that of the human heart.
- |
  

- Here, for the edification of their readers, is a selection from their Social Life files.
- |
  

- "Read previous case files:  #1&#8211;5 ,  #6&#8211;9 , and  #10&#8211;13 ."
- |
  

- The Case of the Sabotaged Taping
- "Status: Suspended"
- With plans to catch up on several hours of Must-see TV, Peter and Jenny seated themselves in front of the television and popped a tape into the VCR.
- |
  

- Instead of canned laughter and wacky high jinks, the tape contained six hours of the Weather Channel.
- |
  

- How had that happened?
- |
  

- So started another mystery for the Shut-In detectives.
- Peter and Jenny considered several scenarios.
- |
  

- Jenny suggested a power failure.
- |
  

- Peter suspected a break-in.
- |
  

- "\"Or perhaps,\""
- |
  

- Jenny wondered, "you blacked out on the couch with the VCR remote under your backside and accidentally pressed 'record,' as you've done several times before.
- "\" Peter countered that this was unlikely, as he only passed out after eating carbs, which he had not done that day."
- "Two possibilities remained: 1) Peter was lying about the carbs; or 2) Somebody was attempting to send the detectives secret encoded messages through the television."
- |
  

- The investigation was suspended when Peter and Jenny decided they would rather watch the weather tape than solve their mystery.
- |
  

- It proved remarkably soothing and soon the detectives were fast asleep, the remote safely on the coffee table, where it belongs.
- |
  

- The Case of the Hombre Mysterioso
- "Status: Solucionado"
- One evening Peter and Jenny were practicing their synchronized dance routine when their roommate Angela interrupted.
- |
  

- "\"I just got another call for 'Humberto,'\""
- |
  

- "\"That's like the hundredth time this year."
- |
  

- Who is Humberto, and why do I keep getting his calls?
- |
  

- By the way, you two look like jerks.
- The dancing sleuths had another mystery on their hands.
- |
  

- Squeezing a reluctant Angela in the middle of their funk sandwich, they began their questioning.
- "\"Do you get these calls during the day, or at night?"
- "\"Both,\""
- |
  

- Angela answered.
- "\"Do the callers sound attractive?"
- "\"How would I know?"
- "\"Do they ever ask what you're wearing?"
- "\"No. What kind of questions are these?"
- "\"Is there anything else you can tell us?"
- "\"Yes."
- |
  

- Humberto gets more calls than I do.
- |
  

- I gave my phone number to two men last week, and the only call I got was from my alumni association.
- "\"That's it!"
- "\" Peter cried."
- |
  

- "\"My dear, you've solved your own mystery."
- |
  

- Obviously, when you're out in the bars, giving your number to anything in pants, you are so drunk that you forget your own name.
- |
  

- You must be introducing yourself as Humberto.
- |
  

- These mysterious calls are, in fact, for you.
- Angela protested that she is a teetotaler, and that the gentlemen recipients of her phone number were, in fact, co-workers, but the detectives concluded these objections were lies.
- |
  

- The cousins further concluded that Angela was lying about their routine looking stupid, because they are really, really good dancers.
- |
  

- The Case of the Ambiguous Complexion OR What Season is Peter?
- "Status: Solved"
- Recently the Shut-Ins invited a few close friends over for an evening of card games and refreshments.
- |
  

- Peter wanted to look his best.
- |
  

- "There was one question: What should he wear?"
- Jenny recommended his long-sleeved olive T-shirt, because it complements his coloring.
- |
  

- Peter disagreed.
- |
  

- "\"Olive makes me look sallow."
- |
  

- But my baby blue polo shirt will bring out my eyes.
- "\" \""
- Don't be silly," Jenny returned.
- |
  

- "\"Blue washes you out."
- |
  

- You're a classic fall.
- "\" Peter shook his head."
- |
  

- "\"I'm a summer."
- |
  

- However, my sister insists I'm a spring.
- The cousins realized they had another mystery on their hands.
- |
  

- They immediately set to work, holding fabric swatches up to Peter's face.
- |
  

- He looked equally good in the cool teal tones of the summer palette, the coral hues of spring, and the warm golds of fall.
- |
  

- When the swatching failed to narrow the field, the detectives daubed Peter's face with makeup.
- |
  

- Still, no clear season emerged.
- It was time to consult the textbook.
- |
  

- There they read that summers are calm and delicate, falls complicated and mysterious, and springs fanciful and fun-loving.
- The mystery was solved.
- |
  

- Peter was a spring.
- |
  

- But he decided to wear the fall olive shirt because it hides stains well.
- |
  

- He also wore a little makeup, because everyone likes to feel pretty.
- |
  

- The Case of the Big Night Out
- "Status: Solved"
- One recent evening the Shut-Ins were prevailed upon to join their friend Mr. G&#8212; in a rare night on the town.
- |
  

- Halfway through a screening of  Dude, Where's My Car?
- |
  

- Mr. G&#8212; disappeared.
- |
  

- Where had he gone?
- |
  

- The detectives set to work.
- "\"Could it be,\""
- |
  

- Peter asked  sotto voce , "that Mr. G&#8212; left because he could take no more of the intoxicated young lady in the fifth row, who is now conducting her fourth cell phone conversation?
- |
  

- The subject of which is, yet again, the fact that she is in a movie theater.
- Jenny thought it was more likely that Mr. G&#8212; left because he could take no more of the same young lady yelling, "Dude, where's my car?
- "\" every five minutes."
- At this point the investigation was suspended, because the movie became extremely compelling.
- |
  

- Twenty minutes later, the mystery was solved when Peter, answering nature's call, found a food-poisoned but otherwise sound Mr. G&#8212; lying on the floor of the men's room.
- |
  

- Peter stepped over his fallen comrade and returned to the theater, whereupon he and Jenny loudly offered possible solutions to the far more entertaining mystery of the titular car's location.
- |
  

- The Case of the Uninvited Visitors
- "Status: Solved"
- Peter and Jenny were awakened one weekday morning by their doorbell.
- |
  

- When Jenny looked out the front window, she saw a pair of neatly-groomed young men in dark suits.
- "\"Don't answer it,\""
- |
  

- Peter, rubbing his eyes.
- |
  

- "\"It's much too early to be defending ourselves against ruffians."
- |
  

- If we stay very quiet, they will surely depart.
- And so the detectives chose prudence over curiosity, and returned to their beds.
- |
  

- When they awoke several hours later, the detectives discussed the identity of their mysterious visitors.
- |
  

- Jenny concluded that since they were wearing black they might be entertainers, or perhaps publicists.
- |
  

- And if they were, in fact, "in the biz," might they be in a cult? But  which  cult?
- The detectives immediately ruled out Scientology and est, because the young men didn't look very self-actualized.
- |
  

- They couldn't be Satanists, because they weren't eating babies.
- |
  

- The lack of literature left on the doorstep left the detectives befuddled.
- |
  

- Who  were  these mysterious guests?
- The solution, it turned out, was obvious.
- |
  

- "\"My dear, we've overlooked the most glaring clue,\""
- |
  

- Peter announced.
- |
  

- "\"Our mysterious visitors rang the doorbell  at 8 AM ."
- |
  

- "Only one sort of person would do that: an asshole."
- |
  

- Identity discovered.
- |
  

- Mystery solved.
- |
  

- Case closed.
- "\" And with that, our intrepid sleuths retreated to their rooms for a well-deserved and much-needed nap."
