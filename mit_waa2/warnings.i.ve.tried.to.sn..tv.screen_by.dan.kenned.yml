- Fact is, he had been out of work for a while and was willing to come down a bit in his fee, which worked for us because we had to adhere to a very small, very restrictive budget to shoot and produce this advertisement.

- Hell yes, I'm going to attempt something.

- Count on it, man.

- A professional driver I am not.

  Professional stunt person. Do not attempt on your own. Always wear proper safety gear when riding any motorcycle. Getting back to the so-called professional stunt person at hand: He's good, but he's not  that  good. Fact is, he had been out of work for a while and was willing to come down a bit in his fee, which worked for us because we had to adhere to a very small, very restrictive budget to shoot and produce this advertisement. But seriously, I'm telling you, he showed up on the set smelling of Irish coffee and cigarettes and was clearly dealing with recent heartbreak. But damned if he didn't nail this on the first take. Which, I guess, if you think about it, is the definition of the consummate professional.
