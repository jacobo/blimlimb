title: A D'Agostino Supermarket Receipt Found Left Inside a Copy of Denis Johnson's "Jesus' Son" by the Previous Person to Check It Out of the Library, Presumably Used as a Bookmark, and Perhaps Shedding Some Light on the Type of Person Who Reads This Book, or Perhaps Not (With Commentary)

  The purchaser of these items (which totaled $21.13), we can postulate,
  lives
  in an apartment with a small kitchen, probably not an eat-in, hence the
  need
  for small garbage bags instead of large. This is in line with the
  theory
  
  that some unifying thread can be found among the readers of Denis
  Johnson's
  "Jesus' Son," as the author of this piece also has a tiny kitchen. You
  couldn't even call it a kitchenette, really. More of a
  kitchenette-ette.
  However, here the similarities end.
  The purchase of many items that fall into the category of "ingredients"
  (that is, things which are generally used in combination in the
  creation
  of
  more complex dishes, as opposed to "stand-alones," which usually
  involve
  the
  slitting of a plastic cover and placement into a microwave oven, or
  something even less complicated than that) suggests a consumer who
  fancies
  himself a bit of a chef. This seems to be borne out by the "EZ Loaf
  Pan"
  
  purchase, which indicates someone who envisions himself cooking not
  merely
  one but *three* loaves of some sort. This portrait of a
  typical-Denis-Johnson-reader-cum-grocery-shopper is at odds with the
  habits of the author of this piece, whose purchases come overwhelmingly
  from the "stand-alone" category, as can be seen from the following
  sample grocery receipt from the local Key Food (which uses a
  20-character column width for product descriptions rather than the
  comparatively generous 25-character
  D'Agostino standard):
  1 HAIN MINI POPCORN RI
  1 BEN&JERRY BROWNIE YO
  1 CELESTE ZESTY PIZZA
  2 CELESTE DELUXE PIZZA
  1 TROPICANA RED G
  1 RICE DREAM
  1 AMY TEXAS VEGGIE BUR
  2 DANNON YOGURT
  1 BRANOLA COUNTRY
  2 HAIN CHICKEN NOODLE
  And this isn't even one of the receipts with Pop-Tarts on it.
  Additional
  
  information can be gleaned from the subjects' methods of payment. Both
  used
  cash, but the D'Agostino shopper paid for his $21.13 purchase with two
  twenty-dollar bills, suggesting a person in a hurry, a person with
  somewhere
  to be, whereas the author of this piece meticulously produced an amount
  of
  cash that would result in a mininum of returned change (in this case, a
  twenty-dollar bill, a five-dollar bill, and eight cents for a tab of
  $24.08), indicating a slightly obsessive personality.
  Clearly, the subject of the grocery shopping habits of library patrons
  who
  check out Denis' Johnson's "Jesus' Son" requires further study.
