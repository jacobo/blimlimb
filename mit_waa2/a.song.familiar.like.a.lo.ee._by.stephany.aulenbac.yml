- I've seen that look on the faces of my friends, I've seen it on the faces of my parents, and on my brother's face, I've seen it on my husband's face, and I know that they've all seen it on mine.

- From where I stand, it's as good a place as any
- I don't know anybody there and
- Nobody knows me
- There'll be a job in Lebanon, Tennessee
- I'll work on a farm, I'll work in some factory
- And I'll buy myself a home down there
- You can get one pretty cheap
- Get off the bus on the border of town
- Head in from the East
- Walk into a bar, take a seat in the corner
- Be a man of mystery.
- So far, so good.

- You want it to happen for this guy, you believe that it can and that it will, even if it hasn't really happened the way everyone expected it to for your friends, or for your family, or for you.

- But this guy, this guy sounds like he's got a chance.
- |
  

- And then, of course, comes the catch.
- |
  

- Because there's always a catch and it's always the same one.

- "The place this guy plans to move to isn't just a different place; it's a whole different world:   Folks don't treat you mean in Lebanon, Tennessee"
- But like a human being, they'll take you in off the street
- They'll bring you in their home down there
- And give you something to eat
- I'm going down to Lebanon, Tennessee.
- And now you know why this guy sounds so sad.
- |
  

- He's going, though.
- |
  

- He's really going.
- |
  

- And you want him to.
- |
  

- And if you were from where I'm from, and if he were sitting across the kitchen table talking to you about this place with that look on his face &#8212; a look like a familiar song &#8212; you'd reach out and put your hands over his folded ones, like the two of you were keeping something safe inside there.
- |
  

- And you'd smile and you'd nod and you'd tell him that it sure sounds good.

  You know the way a person's face looks, when they talk about a place they
  plan to move to. You can see them seeing their whole new perfect life in
  that place. It's practically playing behind their eyes like a movie, like a
  Frank Capra movie. I've seen a lot of those looks &#8212; I grew up in a pretty
  poor place, a place that many people end up having to leave in order to find
  work. I've seen that look on the faces of my friends, I've seen it on the
  faces of my parents, and on my brother's face, I've seen it on my husband's
  face, and I know that they've all seen it on mine. Ron Sexsmith's wistful,
  beautiful, hopeful, hopeless song "Lebanon, Tennessee" sounds just like that
  look:
  
   I'm going down to Lebanon, Tennessee
  From where I stand, it's as good a place as any
  I don't know anybody there and
  Nobody knows me
  There'll be a job in Lebanon, Tennessee
  I'll work on a farm, I'll work in some factory
  And I'll buy myself a home down there
  You can get one pretty cheap
  Get off the bus on the border of town
  Head in from the East
  Walk into a bar, take a seat in the corner
  Be a man of mystery.
  So far, so good. It seems possible. You want it to happen for this guy, you
  believe that it can and that it will, even if it hasn't really happened the
  way everyone expected it to for your friends, or for your family, or for
  you. But this guy, this guy sounds like he's got a chance. And then, of
  course, comes the catch. Because there's always a catch and it's always the
  same one. The place this guy plans to move to isn't just a different place;
  it's a whole different world:
  
   Folks don't treat you mean in Lebanon, Tennessee
  But like a human being, they'll take you in off the street
  They'll bring you in their home down there
  And give you something to eat
  I'm going down to Lebanon, Tennessee.
  And now you know why this guy sounds so sad. He's going, though. He's really
  going. And you want him to. And if you were from where I'm from, and if he
  were sitting across the kitchen table talking to you about this place with
  that look on his face &#8212; a look like a familiar song &#8212; you'd reach out and
  put your hands over his folded ones, like the two of you were keeping
  something safe inside there. And you'd smile and you'd nod and you'd tell
  him that it sure sounds good.
