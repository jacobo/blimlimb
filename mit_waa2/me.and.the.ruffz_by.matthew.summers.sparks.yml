- I stand behind the maple tree in Mom's front yard.
- |
  

- This morning, Mom made my favorite, pancakes.
- |
  

- To me, pancakes have always tasted like victory and vice versa.
- |
  

- My bike is propped against the tree for easy go-to.
- |
  

- My bike doesn't have a kickstand.
- |
  

- Even if it did have a kickstand, kickstands never work on lawns or uneven surfaces.
- |
  

- I've learned that much in my life.
- |
  

- But I've still never ridden with the Ruffz.
- The Ruffz, all twenty-two of them, ride their bikes past Mom's yard.
- |
  

- Two look my way and woof.
- |
  

- I woof back in a way that communicates everything I feel I need to say and not a thing more.
- The Ruffz know I want to be a Ruff.
- Today I become a Ruff.
- |
  

- Today's my twenty-six-and-a-halfth birthday, I will be twenty-six-and-a-half-years-old when I first ride with the Ruffz.
- |
  

- Most of the Ruffz are nine or ten.
- |
  

- They're fourth graders.
- The Ruffz ride down my street and turn the corner.
- |
  

- I "hop to," as I like to say. For example, when I return home during one of these weekends away from my apartment, Mom says, "Matt, go clean your room," and I say, "I'll hop to it." Then I make the nine hops from the kitchen table to my room and clean what Mom and I agree needs cleaning.
- I hop onto my bike and follow the Ruffz at a distance that I consider tastefully discreet.
- This year's Ruffz bike race is no different from any other.
- |
  

- It's at Country Day high school's parking lot.
- |
  

- The winner gets to join the Ruffz.
- |
  

- The losers are pounded.
- |
  

- I won't lose.
- The winner helps pound the losers.
- |
  

- I'm not really excited about that.
- |
  

- I'll probably just give some little nine-year-old a wink and say, "Pretend I'm pounding you good, Sport.
- "\" Then I'll fake punch his stomach and he'll go OOOF until it's time to go."
- |
  

- When he stands and brushes the dead grass from his hair and bike uniform, I'll give him another wink.
- |
  

- This is a tough bike race.
- |
  

- This is my seventeenth race.
- |
  

- Sometimes at work the guys who were Ruffz when we were in school give me trouble.
- During time trials I observe and analyze the other riders' techniques from a distance.
- |
  

- I survey the course map and consider wind resistance.
- |
  

- I sketch a procedural diagram in charcoal pencil.
- |
  

- The sun sets behind me and my shadow casts a dark path over the late-afternoon race.
- This is the time that I'd need some sort of a pep talk from someone sweet.
- But that's okay.
- |
  

- I just know I'll be the winner
- One of the Ruffz blows a whistle.
- |
  

- We all take our places at the starting line.
- |
  

- I attach my racing number to the front of my shirt.
- |
  

- I'm number 26.
- |
  

- The lead Ruff, Bowzer, stands before the riders.
- |
  

- He says, "I'm glad so many of you showed up today.
- |
  

- One of you will be one of the proud, the powerful, the Ruffz.
- |
  

- The rest of you will be pounded.
- |
  

- If this is not acceptable, leave now.
- One of the boys says something that sounds like a marmoset mewling for a steamed carrot.
- |
  

- He pulls his bike out of the race then rides off the parking lot.
- |
  

- He leans it against a tree and watches.
- "\"Anyone else?"
- I look at the rest of the bikers.
- |
  

- They're all staring at me.
- No one else leaves.
- I request a moment.
- Bowzer grants it.
- I quickly consult my procedural diagram.
- |
  

- I am ready.
- |
  

- I nod to Bowzer.
- Bowzer says on your mark, get set, take off!
- And we go.
- I hop to an early lead.
- |
  

- It is obvious I am the best rider here.
- |
  

- As I glide through the rock driveway that had tripped me up so many previous years, I wonder why the others do not just give up.
- I zoom around the row of janitorial service cars, behind the baseball backstop.
- |
  

- As I speed up the steep inclined ramp to the upper parking lot, I smell the greenness of the plants and mowed grass.
- |
  

- I smell victory.
- |
  

- I inhale the day.
- I look behind me to gauge my competition.
- The kid named Rusty is close behind me.
- I turn forward.
- |
  

- The Ruffz have placed branches on the track.
- |
  

- I hop over the first set, but my pedal catches in the second, two-foot diameter bundle of branches.
- Yet again, I'm over handlebars and in the air.
- |
  

- Everything is quiet.
- |
  

- I see clouds and sense that I'm in the sky.
- |
  

- The sun is glorious.
- |
  

- The atmosphere is thin up here.
- |
  

- Where are the birds?
- |
  

- There they are.
- |
  

- I could stay here for days.
- But I notice sounds.
- |
  

- Wind whistles.
- |
  

- Bikes skid to slow stops near the obstacle.
- |
  

- Branches break under tires.
- |
  

- Bikes work their way over the branches.
- |
  

- "I hear the other riders ride, pedal, and breathe hard: I hear them race."
- As I fall, I sense that someone soft has her arms around me.
- |
  

- I smell strawberries and ambrosia.
- |
  

- But I fall on my back in the lawn, well past the branches.
- |
  

- I think my back is broken.
- |
  

- I'm off to the side of the parking lot, beside some landscaped shrubbery.
- Bowzer shouts, "Rusty is the winner.
- |
  

- Long live Rusty!
- The Ruffz cheer.
- Bowzer shouts, "Let the pounding begin!
- Nine- and ten-year-old Ruffz voices yell, whoop, and woof.
- |
  

- I am set upon by all these nine-year-olds' punches and the occasional gratuitious kick to my kidneys.
- I close my eyes.
- |
  

- I met Julie at last year's race.
- |
  

- She came to report on the Ruffz.
- |
  

- She liked my uniform (a caution-light yellow suit with a tomato-orange colander rubber-banded to my head).
- |
  

- She interviewed me, and I posed for a photo.
- |
  

- We got along well.
- |
  

- I asked her to a movie.
- |
  

- After eleven months, Julie broke up with me.
- |
  

- It wasn't her fault.
- Now I've lost my eighteenth Ruffz race and I'm here on the dirt beside a driveway of a private school I didn't even attend being beaten by a bunch of nine- and ten-year-olds.
- |
  

- I say OOF and OW.
- |
  

- My stomach clenches.
- |
  

- I open my eyes.
- |
  

- Three size-four Reeboks step on rough spots in the lawn.
- |
  

- I taste those disgusting stomach acids, and my pancakes lurch out.
- |
  

- I spit.
- |
  

- I spit at the Ruffz as they kick and wallop, but it all just comes back at me.
