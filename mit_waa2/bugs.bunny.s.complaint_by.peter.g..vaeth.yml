  Bugs Bunny was complaining to us about his eyesight. "Remember that episode," he said, "where the doctor asked me to read the eye chart and I read the fine print at the bottom of the page? That wasn't acting&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;that was  real ."
  He blamed his freakish vision on all the carrots he'd eaten over his career. Hundreds of short films, endless re-takes with Daffy, walk-on cameos, photo shoots for t-shirts and coffee mugs, modeling for stuffed animals and amusement park costumes&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;all done while sawing away at carrot after carrot with his two buck teeth, orange shards flying furiously into the air.
  The carrot was part of who he was. The carrot was who he was, Bugs was saying to us, in that distinctive Leporidaen accent of his. His image, his character, his art, his entire representation of self made manifest in a phallic vegetable. It was both his security blanket and magic sword, an Excalibur that lent perfect timing to the signature line that made him an icon. And here, just to make his point, Bugs said, "What's up, doc?" Without the usual pregnant pause as he chomped on a carrot and the snotty insouciance of talking while chewing his food, the line sounded like just another empty catchphrase.
  Sans  carrot, Bugs wasn't clever, he was just another rabbit with ADHD.
  So the whole carrot thing took on a life all its own, Bugs was saying. I was thinking: addiction perpetuated by psychosexual dilemmas. His life was his work, and his work was his life, his work was carrots and carrots were his life. And if he had an especially long day at the drawing board?
