- I started hitting things when I turned nine.

- Now I am ten, and in between, I've hit about as much as someone my age can hit without getting sent to boot camp&#151;though I've been threatened many times.
- |
  

- I hit the cat when it sat in my lap and I didn't want it to sit in my lap.
- |
  

- I hit my sister on her way up the stairs.
- |
  

- I hit my sister when she was on the floor, watching TV.
- |
  

- I also gave her a kick to the ribs.
- |
  

- Then I said I was sorry and offered her some candy, but when she reached for it, I punched her in the arm&#151;right on the bony part of her elbow so I could hear the impact.
- |
  

- Outside my house, I punched the tree until my knuckles turned red.
- |
  

- I whacked my neighbor's tetherball to prove that I am a normal kid, that I hit things that other kids hit.
- |
  

- But the tetherball deflated so I hit the metal pole because it was shiny and also because it was there.
- |
  

- In class, I hit all the kids who brought their tie-wearing dads to Career Day.
- |
  

- I hit the new kid from across the room with a box of crayons and that pissed off the teacher.
- |
  

- During recess she made me sit in the principal's office, where I scowled at the bug-eyed secretary.
- |
  

- One day I hit everything yellow that I saw.
- |
  

- The next day I hit everything that was blue, including my mom's mini-van.
- |
  

- I hit every wooden fence I passed when she made me walk home.
- |
  

- In my head, I was hitting the bastards on the bus that laughed and passed me by.
- |
  

- For weeks, I hit my mom every time she tried to give me the pills that make me stop hitting.
- |
  

- Inside, she told me, I am all folded up like a piece of origami&#151;and that's when I hit her.
- |
  

- On a day off from school, I smacked my old grandma because she never moves from her corner spot by the window.
- |
  

- She sits in the same position, just like the figurines I broke when I hit the legs of the table and they fell off.
- |
  

- I got real close and she smelled like tangerines and then I hit her.
- |
  

- She squawked.
- |
  

- She shifted in her seat and that surprised me enough to make me want to hug her.
- |
  

- Mom says everyone needs a hug sometimes, even Grandma, even me.
- |
  

- I didn't give her a hug.
- |
  

- Instead, I hit the couch cushion where my father used to sit.
- |
  

- I punched his old dresser drawers, and then ripped up the few T-shirts that were left.
- |
  

- I hit a pillow on my bed until the feathers were everywhere and my sister asked me if I killed a bird.
- |
  

- I pummeled her until she squealed and then I flipped her the bird.
- |
  

- That will teach you a lesson, I said.
- |
  

- At dinner once, I hit my spoon against my glass of milk,  tink tink tink , because it got too quiet at the kitchen table between my half-deaf old grandma and my bruised sister.
- |
  

- I hit my fork against the ketchupy edges of the meatloaf.
- |
  

- I massacred the green beans.
- |
  

- After I got sent to my room, I lay on the floor and pounded my fists onto the blue carpet.
- |
  

- I jumped up and boxed with an imaginary man, swinging my fists at the air.
- |
  

- I hit the cat again.
- |
  

- And my sister, too.
- |
  

- I'm running out of things to hit.
- |
  

- Soon, I will be eleven.
