- Every atom in this room knows that it must move and it doesn't resist or struggle with that part of its nature.

- It doesn't argue with its urge to be in motion, and because of this, things like that coffee table remain solid.

- If the atoms in that table stopped moving, that table would cease to be matter, this we know.

- Well, it's like that with people, too, really.
- |
  

- You see, inside all of us is a cellular and genetic code centuries old, designed to keep us in constant motion on a cellular level, some cells living, some cells dying, all part of the wiring designed to keep you living, to keep you moving, to keep you growing.

- But Daddy has to fight it, doesn't he?
- |
  

- Daddy has to think about it, and analyze it, doesn't he?
- |
  

- So, inside of Daddy the cells receive their usual neurological directives, and then they listen to the hemming and hawing and wondering.

- The "
- I don't want to, but I have to" song and dance.
- |
  

- The "Someday maybe, oh never mind, forget it" dance.
- |
  

- The cells lurch to and fro, unsure of what they're being told.
- |
  

- And for this, sir, you are literally the cause of your own cowardice.
- |
  

- You are literally trying to make what is you disappear, cease to be matter.
- |
  

- In that regard, you are biologically your own worst enemy, and I am your day of reckoning, the person who makes you stop fighting yourself.
- |
  

- The person who makes you finally understand how to give in to your nature and enjoy the reward and abundance of that.
- "ME: Do you want a silly juicy?"
- |
  

- Are you thirsty?
- |
  

- Thirsty juicy?
- "HIM: Will you ever see it?"
- |
  

- You are literally made of a billion tiny conflicts and it's killing you.
