- "Symptoms:  You experience nausea and violent vomiting as you wake up."
- |
  

- You feel dizzy and sluggish.
- |
  

- A well-dressed bald man stands next to your bed.
- |
  

- He waves a green rock above your head and grins maliciously.
- |
  

- His henchmen cackle.
- "Diagnosis:  You are not so much a little bit pregnant as you are a little bit Superman."
- |
  

- It was foolish to have expected the glasses to work forever.
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  You're late."
- |
  

- You do not experience irritability as much as you seem to sense it from everyone else.
- |
  

- You seem to increase in size everyday.
- |
  

- Also, you are the worst.
- "Diagnosis:  You are not so much a little bit pregnant as you are Matt Moro, and you have arrived an hour late for our fantasy draft."
- |
  

- And then you have the gall to take Beltran.
- |
  

- Don't expect to be invited back, Fatty.
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  Your breasts become tender and you experience light bleeding."
- |
  

- After a few more minutes, the bleeding stops.
- |
  

- We loved you.
- "Diagnosis:  You are not so much a little bit pregnant as a little bit of last year's Thanksgiving turkey."
- |
  

- You were delicious.
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  You experience dizziness and vomiting."
- |
  

- You increasingly feel the need to urinate.
- |
  

- You suffer from violent mood swings.
- |
  

- You slap me for no reason upon returning from the restroom.
- |
  

- I leave the bar, silent and pathetic.
- "Diagnosis:  You are not so much a little bit pregnant as you are a little bit drunker than I thought."
- |
  

- "Bonus diagnosis:  I am a little bit of a wuss."
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  You salivate excessively and look visibly constipated."
- |
  

- You disgust me.
- "Diagnosis:  Matt Moro again."
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  You are visited by an angel who tells you that you will give birth to the Messiah."
- |
  

- You can feel movement in your belly.
- |
  

- You continue to experience moderate to severe diarrhea.
- "Diagnosis:  You are not so much a little bit pregnant as you are a little bit closer to realizing that your intestinal-parasite medication doesn't work."
- |
  

- And that it causes hallucinations.
- |
  

- You are much less full of grace than full of intestinal parasites.
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  Your body temperature elevates sharply."
- |
  

- You begin to feel bubbly all over.
- |
  

- You are somewhat thicker and chunkier than Ragu.
- "Diagnosis:  You are not so much a little bit pregnant as a little bit Prego."
- |
  

- Hey, why don't you just jump right into Matt Moro's mouth and save us all some time?
- |
  

- "Symptoms:  You experience nausea and often feel faint."
- |
  

- You suffer from food cravings and aversions.
- |
  

- It is 23 years ago.
- |
  

- Your name is Janice Moro.
- "Diagnosis:  You are a lot pregnant."
- |
  

- Congratulations, Mrs. Moro!
- |
  

- It's a jerk!
