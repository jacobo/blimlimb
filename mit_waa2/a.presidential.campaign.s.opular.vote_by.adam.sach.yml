- Ladies and Gentlemen,
- Thank you very much for inviting me to your wonderful state here in the great heartland of America but also pretty near the coast.
- |
  

- It is an honor to speak from this podium, in this storied courthouse, where so many profound legal judgments were handed down that they more or less canceled each other out.
- I am a simple man with a Harvard degree and a solid understanding of tractors.
- |
  

- "When I was a young boy, my father took me on his knee and told me the principle that has guided my life ever since: \"Agree with some things, disagree with other things."
- "\" His was truly the Greatest Generation, along with a few that came before and a couple that have come since."
- Why am I running for president of the United States of America?
- |
  

- That's a good question, and perhaps there's no good way to answer it.
- |
  

- Or perhaps there is a good way to answer it.
- |
  

- Either way, it's a good question and I'm glad it was raised.
- I want to talk a little bit about our nation's children.
- |
  

- Before this speech, a young man named Stanley Exley came up to me.
- |
  

- Stanley is a mechanic, a noble profession if there ever was one.
- |
  

- Or perhaps he is a chemistry professor, also noble.
- |
  

- He was holding his small daughter, Emily, an adorable 3-year-old who was recently diagnosed with leukemia.
- |
  

- "Stanley is a straight shooter, and he came up to me and asked me a question I'll never forget: \"Do you like children?"
- "\" And I looked him straight in the eye and said, \""
- Yes, Stanley, I very much like children.
- "\" Maybe that's not a popular opinion, but it's what I believe."
- |
  

- And to those of you who would say, "
- "I don't think children are our future,\" I must reply in the strongest of terms: \"I disagree.\" Sometimes you have to take a stand for what you believe in."
- Our country is sharply divided over a war that is being waged in a distant land.
- |
  

- "My views on this war are clear: it is happening, it is happening in Iraq, and it will continue to happen until it stops."
- |
  

- Some people believe we should withdraw all the troops now.
- |
  

- Some people believe we should stay and fight until we've established a stable nation.
- |
  

- Some people believe we should gradually hand over control to the Iraqi government.
- |
  

- I feel blessed to live in a country with so many beliefs.
- "On the subject of South African apartheid: I strongly, strongly, strongly oppose it."
- |
  

- I'm glad it's gone, and I hope it never comes back.
- The state of our economy is in flux.
- |
  

- Every single day, the stock market goes up or goes down or stays the same.
- |
  

- If elected president, I will ask the Federal Reserve to take a good long look at the interest rate and decide whether or not to change it.
- |
  

- If elected president, I will create jobs where there are none, and where there are jobs, I will create internships.
- Let us take actions that will make people happy.
- Let us take actions that will make people healthy or perhaps have the private sector do it.
- Let us take actions regarding taxes.
- And let us move boldly so that our children and our children's children can look back and say, "I'm glad they moved boldly on this, this, and that.
- Thank you.

  Ladies and Gentlemen,
