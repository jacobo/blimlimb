- A hot topic is wormhole transformation.

- Which of you doesn't believe in the theory?

- Can I see a show of tentacles?
- "DEMOQ: I'm amazed we're still debating wormhole transformation in the year 12,535 After Dorzon."
- "GOPOX: Let me clarify."

- Although I  do  believe in wormhole transformation, when I gaze outside my starship with my seven eyes at the Valporian sun shining on the Paronius Galaxy, I see the Divine Creator Dorzon's residual trail of slime.
- "MODERATOR: Indeed, a beautiful image."

- Let's turn to the economy.

- Demoq, financial stratification has been a central plank of your campaign.
- "DEMOQ: I believe we now have two Upsilon Sigmas: the oxygen-rich and the oxygen-poor."
- "GOPOX: How can Demoq claim any authority on this subject when he owns an opulent 22-moon planet and spent 400 zazoos on a cranial epidermis replacement?"
- "DEMOQ: Yet you're allowed to dodge the starfleet draft and vote for the Iota-12 War?"
- |
  

- You're nothing but a chicken-clone-hawk-clone!
- "MODERATOR: Please restrain yourselves from making ad-alienus attacks."
- |
  

- Demoq, are you fully against the war?
- "DEMOQ: While I don't rule out interstellar combat in all cases, I believe we were duped into fighting this mismanaged star war for scientifically fictional reasons, and it is time to teleport our troops home."
- |
  

- It's distracting us from other priorities, such as universal health insurance.
- "GOPOX: It is not the responsibility of the Upsilon Sigma government to provide health care to the  entire  universe."
- |
  

- And if we leave Iota-12 now, then the space pirates from 942.
- |
  

- "DEMOQ: The tragic events of 942."
- |
  

- "Iota- 13  star\x97Iota-12 had nothing to do with it, and now their inhabitants and the intergalactic community regard us as oppressive colonizers."
- |
  

- "We've gotten sucked into an unwinnable black hole, and our brave starfighters\x97whom I support, by the way\x97are dying in vain for xycanthium deposits."
- |
  

- No more green circulatory fluid for xycanthium!
- "MODERATOR: What do you propose?"
- "DEMOQ: We need to curb our dependence on foreign reserves of xycanthium by doing things like not flying sport-utility motherships that get under 10 parsecs a gallon\x97to prevent wars like this  and  to stop the scourge of cosmic warming."
- |
  

- We owe it not only to ourselves but also to our larvae, and our larvae's larvae.
- "GOPOX: Great, and while we're setting our mothership industry back countless light-years, why don't we outsource all work to a rival solar system?"
- |
  

- Or would you rather just take down the planetary force fields and hire the illegal aliens?
- "DEMOQ: By \"illegal aliens,\" do you mean aliens from other solar systems who live here without citizenship, or do you mean our own alien citizens who act illegally\x97in other words, criminals?"
- "MODERATOR: We're getting lost in spacial semantics."
- |
  

- "Last topic: The High Council has been hearing sounds lately of aggression from yet another star system."

- Should we pre-emptively invade Earth?
- "DEMOQ: No\x97it's another unnecessary war."
- "GOPOX: This is one area where we agree."
- |
  

- Without our intervention, the pitiful Earthlings will soon enough destroy themselves.
- "MODERATOR: I'm glad we could end on a note of unity and optimism."

- Tune in next time when the candidates debate laser control, homeplanet security, and interspecies marriage.
