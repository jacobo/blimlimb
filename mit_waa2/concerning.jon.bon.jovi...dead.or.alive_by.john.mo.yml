- "Attention, all law enforcement in the region:"
- I realize many of you have become cynical about the all-points bulletins issued for dangerous criminals.
- |
  

- I'm sure you think they're essentially all the same and that only the names have changed.
- |
  

- But I urge you to pay close attention in your pursuit of Mr. Jon Bon Jovi.
- |
  

- He's wanted.
- |
  

- Wanted dead or live.
- Who is Bon Jovi?
- |
  

- Well, to begin with, he's a cowboy.
- |
  

- Granted, it's fairly routine for cowboys to run afoul of the law, especially in the winter, when the work and money dry up and they've got time on their hands.
- |
  

- Plenty of petty-theft and lewd-behavior calls.
- |
  

- But that's not what we're up against.
- |
  

- Bon Jovi is no regular cowboy.
- |
  

- He rides a horse made of steel.
- |
  

- A steel horse.
- |
  

- I am not shitting you.
- |
  

- And don't think this is some sort of comical clunky robot horse with whimsical hydraulic sound effects and extraneous flashing lights.
- |
  

- This thing is exactly like a Thoroughbred, only much larger and made from an incredibly resilient alloy.
- |
  

- Bullets can't even penetrate this horse, much less stop it.
- |
  

- Bon Jovi is also armed with a loaded six-string that he carries on his back.
- |
  

- Reports differ on whether he uses it as a sort of crossbow or whether it's actually a guitar that he plays with such shocking mastery as to render victims helpless.
- |
  

- Regardless, take heed.
- There is other information I need to share with you about Bon Jovi.
- |
  

- And no matter how callous you think you are to the attributes of criminals, you may want to brace yourself.
- |
  

- Bon Jovi has almost superhuman abilities.
- |
  

- Sure, sometimes he sleeps, but sometimes he can go for days without doing so.
- |
  

- Days!
- |
  

- To compensate for this interruption in his circadian rhythms, Bon Jovi has evidently crafted some sort of alcohol-based calendar, where he can actually tell the day by the bottle that he drinks.
- |
  

- Additionally, he's been known to drive all night just to get back home (his house has an adjoining cybertronic-horse barn), so we're casting a pretty wide net.
- |
  

- Also, according to intelligence we've gathered, sometimes when he's alone, all he does is think.
- |
  

- That's not a criminal act, mind you, but good to know.
- So why are we looking for Bon Jovi?
- |
  

- Why is he wanted, wanted dead or alive?
- |
  

- A spree of face rocking.
- |
  

- "Estimates vary as to how many faces have been targeted\x97some say 800,000, some say 1.2 million\x97but it is accepted as a fact that he has rocked every single face he has seen."
- |
  

- Every one of them.
- |
  

- We're not even clear on a motive for this mass face rocking, although there are reports of Bon Jovi complaining of faces that "are so cold.
- "\" Will he stop at a million faces?"
- |
  

- How many will be enough?
- |
  

- We can't afford to find out.
- Now all this being said, if you should come in contact with Bon Jovi, do  not  look into his face.
- |
  

- He will only rock it.
- |
  

- And call for backup immediately.
- |
  

- Bear in mind, the man has been everywhere, he stands tall, and he rides a steel horse.
- Good luck to you all.
- |
  

- At this point, I have to be honest, we're living on a prayer.
- Sincerely,
- Sgt.
