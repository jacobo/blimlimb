- Could it have to do with the rumors swirling about France and America?

- Although we don't want to be indiscreet about our longtime friends, Ireland must divulge to another sovereign nation what it has witnessed.

- We will not do so, however, without an explicit guarantee that this will remain a state secret.
- Senegal
- Sadly, the community of nations knows what a poor record of secrets-rights abuses our republic has exhibited in the past, so we are hesitant to make such a commitment.

- However, our mission stands by its long-held position that a nation cannot, without seriously upsetting diplomatic relations, begin to say something so juicy and not actually finish the story.
- Ireland
- Nevertheless, the Irish must have that commitment.
- Senegal
- Fine.

- State secret.

- "Then let us not be caught up in the flourishes of diplomacy: Let us just say that the trans-Atlantic relationship has been ."

- Ireland
- Perhaps we are reading too much into Senegal's latest dispatch, but we think we detect a note of jealousy.
- Senegal
- Well .
- |
  

- Republic of Senegal has been separated from France for over 45 years now, but we still hate to see them doing so well.
- |
  

- We don't know .
- |
  

- It's like maybe they've changed, you know?
- Ireland
- The Republic of Ireland has always kept in mind that both it and Senegal share a colonial past.
- |
  

- We understand, believe us, but you've got to realize, those powers never change.
- |
  

- Look at England!
- |
  

- Yes, we talk, and one could suppose we have as warm a relationship as possible for an ex-colony, but even after our per-capita GDP overtook theirs, they still don't give us the time of day.
- |
  

- No, not like they do with Canada or Australia.
- |
  

- Not to mention the Ulster thing.
- |
  

- Ireland can't even imagine why Wales and Scotland still maintain the charade of union.
- |
  

- Don't they want their own future?
- |
  

- Whoa.
- |
  

- Sorry.
- |
  

- We're rambling on a little bit.
- Senegal
- While the Senegalese appreciate the sympathy of the Irish, we have to wonder why a rich, Christian EU nation would want to rub salt in the wound, so to speak, of our colonial pains.
- Ireland
- What?
- |
  

- No! That's not what we meant at all!
- |
  

- Oh, where is our fabled wit when we most need it?
- Senegal
- Look, if Ireland doesn't mind, Senegal would just as soon break off diplomatic relations for the afternoon.
- Ireland
- The Republic of Ireland has always found Senegal very attractive for a member of the African Union.
- Senegal
- Your Excellencies have got to be kidding Our Excellencies.
- |
  

- First of all, yikes, that is just offensive.
- |
  

- Second of all .
- |
  

- Ireland
- Well, our peacekeepers are going to be spending a lot of time together in the coming months, and we were thinking .
- |
  

- Note From the French Mission to the U.N.
- The glorious Fifth Republic of France extends its warmest greetings to our friends Senegal, and would also like to inquire as to what the Irish have been in such a fit about all morning.
- Senegal
- The Republic of Senegal would very much like to extend to the "glorious" Fifth Republic of France our offer of just shutting the hell up. We know about you and America.
- France
- C'est la vie, baby.
- |
  

- France has got to do what France has got to do to keep up appearances.
- |
  

- America means nothing to us.
- |
  

- Listen, we were just coming by to see if you were interested in a little bit of trade discussion in the back room.
- Ireland
- Oh, come on already.
- |
  

- Senegal's not interested, France!
- |
  

- Don't you have a Security Council meeting somewhere?
- Senegal
- Nations!
- |
  

- This is 2007.
- |
  

- Senegal is not a prize to be fought over.
- |
  

- France, we are  not  going to become entangled in any sort of "trade discussion" with you, like some sort of Third-World hussy. And Ireland ... you're nice and all, but come on. "Very attractive for a member of the African Union"?
- |
  

- Forget it.
- |
  

- We're going to see what China is up to.
- "SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON: I look forward to working closely with you, with the African Union, and with all governments concerned as we advance toward our shared goal."
- |
  

- Thank you.
- Ireland
- Well, I think we learned a valuable lesson in international relations today.
- France
- Shut the fuck up, Ireland.
