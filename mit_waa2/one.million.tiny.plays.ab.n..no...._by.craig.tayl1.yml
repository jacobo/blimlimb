- Two men stand at a bar in the financial district of The City.
- |
  

- The NatWest building is visible out of one of the windows.
- |
  

- They've set their briefcases at their feet.
- |
  

- "Harry: It's frustrating."
- "Michael: Frustrating is one way to describe it."
- |
  

- I propose we make up a list of those who haven't attended the last four meetings and simply revoke membership.
- "Harry: That would be effective."
- "Michael: Then we send out a form to remaining members that allows us to collect all their updated details."
- "Harry: Someone would need to process the forms."
- "Michael: It's the kind of thing that could be done for a few hours each day."
- |
  

- We could bring in someone from Personnel to work on it.
- "Harry: But to deal with membership details?"
- "Michael: Yes."
- "Harry: They'd have to respect confidentiality."
- "Michael: Most of Personnel is fine."
- |
  

- There are only a few that have any sort of airs and graces.
- |
  

- It would be a question of finding someone who knows when to stop talking as much as she knows when to start.
- "Harry: Or he knows when to start."
- "Michael: I beg your pardon?"
- "Harry: You said she."
- |
  

- But in my experience I've had plenty of problems with the men in Personnel.
- "Michael: Of course, of course."
- |
  

- Yes, you're absolutely right.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Michael: Though the men don't seem to be quite as diffident, do they?"
- "Harry: Well, there's that."
- "Michael: You've seen it too?"
- "Harry: To a certain extent."
- "Michael: You've noticed?"
- |
  

- I'm glad someone else has.
- |
  

- I was beginning to feel I was on my own with that observation.
- |
  

- I don't know the right word for it.
- "Harry: No, an adjective doesn't immediately come to mind."
- "Michael: Is uppity too strong?"
- "Harry: Hard to say, isn't it?"
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Michael: You see, the other problem is our e-mails just aren't being picked up by members."
- |
  

- Half of them don't check their home accounts for messages concerning meeting times.
- "Harry: Yes, I know."
- "Michael: Even I only check my e-mail at home once a week."
- |
  

- It gets filled with such unsolicited nonsense.
- |
  

- People don't want to open up their accounts to deal with an avalanche of messages they didn't even ask for.
- "Harry: It's a huge problem these days."
- "Michael: \"Do you need help with your creditors?"
- "\" That sort of thing."
- "Harry: Yes."
- "Michael: \"How about some cheap plane tickets to Jamaica?"
- "Harry: I believe I received that one too."
- "Michael: But you know what the worst is?"
- "Harry: No, I don't."
- "Michael: The worst is the pornography."
- |
  

- It just comes from out of nowhere.
- "Harry: Yes, I agree."
- |
  

- Somehow they get your name from a list or what have you.
- |
  

- "Michael: \"Hot Lesbians\" and such."
- "Harry: Their tactic is to flood your mailbox with more and more messages even if you write back asking them not to."
- |
  

- It's awful.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Michael: You ever take a peek at it?"
- "Harry: No, I can't say that I have."
- "Michael: No, me neither."
- |
  

- I find that sort of thing has no effect on me.
- |
  

- Hot, licking lesbians.
- |
  

- Seems just ridiculous.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Michael: There was even one for fat lesbians."
- |
  

- Fat  lesbians.
- |
  

- And they were supposedly tied to each other somehow, if you can believe that.
- |
  

- Some sort of contraption of knots apparently.
- |
  

- Pause.
- |
  

- "Michael: Right."
- |
  

- Well, what do you say?
- |
  

- Shall we have another?
- "Harry: I really shouldn't really stay."
- |
  

- Train's at quarter past.
- "Michael: A half pint?"
- "Harry: Perhaps just a half."
- "Michael: Good man."
- |
  

- Good man.
