- "It's a clich\xE9, but I mean it."
- |
  

- You're a lovely person and we had a good run.
- |
  

- I just no longer feel comfortable in a relationship with a person whose smallest emotional fluctuations wreak massive havoc on the surrounding physical world.
- Honey, please, calm down.
- |
  

- No, you're not.
- |
  

- How can I tell?
- |
  

- The silverware floating 4 inches above the table was a clue.
- |
  

- I know the set was a gift from your mother.
- |
  

- I know she is a lovely, caring woman.
- |
  

- However, if she gave you a little space, maybe we could have solved this.
- I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.
- |
  

- Please put the dog down.
- |
  

- No, I don't love him more than you.
- |
  

- Well, at least one of you is happy to see me when I get home each day.
- |
  

- I do care!
- |
  

- Now, however, thanks to all the flying glass, I seem to be bleeding profusely from my brachial artery.
- |
  

- Not to mention we just had those windows weatherproofed.
- |
  

- There's another month's pay down the drain.
- That certainly was not an insinuation.
- |
  

- "I'm sure plenty of women can't see the word  SALE  without feeling compelled to buy half of Dillard's\x97then rend the store, brick from mortar, once their credit is rejected."
- |
  

- You never even wore that blue blouse.
- I'm passive-aggressive?
- |
  

- I'm not the one who smiles sweetly while silently triggering psychokinetic devastation on the majority of her boyfriend's biological processes.
- |
  

- Or is that just your cooking?
- Great.
- |
  

- Your rage-fueled psionic storm has now torn through the very fabric of existence, opening a portal to a demon dimension of unspeakable horror.
- |
  

- I always said your temper would get you in serious trouble one day.
- |
  

- Don't come running to me when whatever Joe Truckstop you shack up with next isn't as understanding when hell goblins from beyond the curtain of human perception pick at his eyeballs.
- |
  

- Marla always says I am way too accommodating.
- That's not fair.
- |
  

- Marla is a very respectable woman.
- |
  

- All I'm saying is it's nice to have an intelligent conversation once in a while.
- |
  

- I guess it doesn't matter, now that the Apocalypse is nigh, but, yes, we're sleeping together.
- |
  

- There, I said it.
- |
  

- I'm leaving you for Marla, existence as we know it is coming to an end, and I lied when I said I enjoyed  Tuesdays With Morrie .
- |
  

- I found it cloying and maudlin.
- I hope you're happy now.
