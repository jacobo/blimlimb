- Ben also went to Old Donation for the Gifted and Talented.
- |
  

- He only had one more year left and then it would be off to Norfolk Academy private school.
- |
  

- The thought of private school was tremendously aggravating for Ben, but fortunately time goes by much slower when you are younger, and anything was possible.
- |
  

- Meanwhile, there were games of bicycle tag to be played, Dungeons and Dragons pewter figures to be painted, and programs to be written on the Apple 2 plus.

- |
  

- LINE 30, "GOTO LINE TEN."
- Ways to impress friends and ways to destroy things are items on the top of most kid's list.
- |
  

- Ben was no exception.
- |
  

- When the opportunity presented itself for Mom's friend Marvin to round up large quantities of fireworks from South Carolina, he wasted no time in bidding a request.
- |
  

- Ben stared at the green screen for a second and then continued diligently typing away in Basic.
- |
  

- He entered line two hundred and thirty of his magnum opus, "IF 120 = ' yes' THEN 20.
- "\" Once the program was initiated, BENJIMOBILE would flash in all caps repeatedly, followed by a high resolution drawing of a vehicle that would inch its way across the glowing screen."
- |
  

- Mom yelled from downstairs, "
- OK guys, dinner," and Ben saved his program onto a five and a half inch floppy.
- |
  

- The disk drive gurgled and moaned as Ben hopped down the stairs.
- "\"Chicken Divan?"
- "\" Ben asked with his lip curled up on the right side."
- "\"Where's Mike?"
- Mom didn't answer as she opened the oven door with a green mitt.
- |
  

- Ben sat down and immediately picked out the mushroom bits and placed them on his napkin.
- |
  

- Mom added a quadrant of margarined acorn squash to each plate and set the remainder down on the hot tray next to the table.
- |
  

- She then took her own seat and placed a napkin on her lap.
- "\"What time's Uncle Julian getting here?"
- "\"Within the next hour is my guess,\""
- |
  

- Mom.
- |
  

- "\"Theresa MacGilveray should be here at seven."
- |
  

- You guys gonna be okay with her?
- With a mouthful of food Ben mumbled, "Sure, she's cool.
- "\"I expect you guys to spend a lot of time this evening on your homework."
- |
  

- I know you've both got some make-up work to do tonight.
- Theresa MacGilveray showed up at seven fifteen and was chewing a wad of watermelon flavored Hubba Bubba with her mouth open.
- |
  

- Mom laid out the rules for the evening as Uncle Julian stood with his arms crossed and listened.
- |
  

- She then kissed our foreheads and the two adults left for the night.
- The evening started with a round of  Space Invaders  on the Atari.
- |
  

- It was then followed by an episode of  Dallas .
- |
  

- Theresa turned off the TV when the show was over and said, "Homework time!
- With a little reluctance, we headed for our bedrooms.
- Theresa headed for the avocado green phone, which sat on the desk in the kitchen.
- |
  

- First she called Amy Riddick but Amy had gone to the Bamboo Hut for dinner with her parents.
- |
  

- Then she called Melissa Zorinski.
- |
  

- She talked to Melissa for over an hour about the hot new boys at Lynhaven Junior High School.
- |
  

- Melissa encouraged her to call David Guy.
- |
  

- David seemed like the best candidate for an evening of telephone flirtation.
- |
  

- Besides, he had passed his phone number over to her in World Geography class on Monday.
- |
  

- Nonetheless, her heart pounded and her mouth dried up while the phone rang on the other end.
- Ben sat on his bed and decided to start with math.
- |
  

- He opened his spiral bound notebook.
- |
  

- Fifteen minutes later he had completed the entire assignment.
- |
  

- He then went to his social studies assignment.
- |
  

- It was a story about a family moving into a suburb of Chicago.
- |
  

- There was a father, mother, and a boy.
- |
  

- The boy was terribly upset over the move.
- |
  

- He missed his friends in San Diego.
- |
  

- The father explained the importance of the move and the new job he had taken.
- |
  

- Ben grew bored.
- |
  

- Ben lifted his head and listened to the diluted sound of the Go-Go's echoing from down the hall.
- Ben rested the book face down on the bed.
- |
  

- He yawned and swished his tongue against his teeth, discovering an annoying piece of broccoli wedged between two molars.
- |
  

- Eventually he worked it out of his mouth and spit it toward the trashcan by the door.
- |
  

- He walked over to the box of fireworks on the floor and squatted down next to it.
- |
  

- Ben reached in and pulled out a brick of firecrackers and stared at the red waxy paper encasement.
- |
  

- The label was half peeled off the front exposing the magic that lay within.
- |
  

- Edging back the package a bit more, the colors of each individual firecracker became visible.
- |
  

- They alternated between blue with white stars and red with white stars.
- |
  

- Now removing the red waxy paper from the brick, he studied the long white string that wound around each firecracker holding the block together as one unit.
- |
  

- Why not remove the string and separate each individual firecracker?
- |
  

- This would stretch out the rations even further.
- |
  

- At least one brick might be fun to separate.
- |
  

- Why not?
- |
  

- A minute later the brick had become 40 individual red and blue explosives.
- |
  

- He held the white string in his hand and returned all the loose firecrackers to the box below him.
- The string was about six inches long and smelled like gunpowder.
- |
  

- It had similar qualities to the wicks that stuck out from each firework, but was actually a piece of string and not paper wrapped around gunpowder.
- |
  

- In fact, there was no gunpowder on this string at all.
- |
  

- The odor was simply residue from the package that it had been holding together.
- |
  

- Ben wondered if it would carry a spark like a wick.
- |
  

- Perhaps it would act like a delayed fuse.
- |
  

- Less gunpowder, more delay.
- |
  

- More delay meant a faster escape.
- |
  

- This could prove useful in the upcoming weekend adventures.
- There were plenty more of these pieces of string holding together the other bricks of firecrackers in the box.
- |
  

- Would it be such a bad thing to test this one out?
- |
  

- It was only Wednesday and although it was agreed that nothing would be lit until Friday evening, did this really fall under the category of firework?
- |
  

- Ben didn't think so.
- |
  

- This was simply a piece of string.
- |
  

- No firework attached.
- |
  

- In a similar sense, candles were just pieces of string attached to wax.
- |
  

- This didn't even have wax attached to it.
- |
  

- No need to even go outside.
- |
  

- Besides, Theresa would be less than thrilled to find Ben out of his room so soon.
- |
  

- Although homework was long since forgotten, at least he could do some experimentation with the wick in the privacy of his own bedroom.
- Ben reached down into the brown bag next to the box of fireworks.
- |
  

- Although the bag was now empty, it still contained two packs of generic black matchbooks.
- |
  

- Grabbing a pack and pulling off a match from inside, Ben held up the wick in the palm of his left hand.
- |
  

- He lit the match with his right hand and watched the sulfur ignite into a blue and then yellow flame.
- |
  

- He placed the pack of matches back on the floor, still holding on to the wick and lit the match.
- |
  

- Then, holding the string at one side, he lit the opposite end.
- |
  

- He quickly blew out the match and kept an eye on the lit wick.
- |
  

- He studied its properties as the flame grew and shrank.
- |
  

- It then turned to a spark and flickered as it hit some gunpowder.
- |
  

- Then it returned to small flame again and nearly went out.
- |
  

- Ben gave it a slight breath of air.
- |
  

- Before he knew what had happened, the flame hit another patch of gunpowder, sizzled, and a spark raced toward his left hand at a harrowing velocity.
- |
  

- Half out of fear of burning his fingers and half out of shock, Ben dropped the wick.
- |
  

- You can probably guess where it fell.
- |
  

- Ben yelled at the top of his lungs, "Mike, comere quick!
- "\" He ran to the furthest corner of the room, crouched to the ground, and covered his head and ears with his hands."
- |
  

- Ben shut his eyes and began humming to himself.
