- It is just the two of us now on my island.
- |
  

- Sooner or later thirst will overcome you.
- |
  

- You will recall the story I told years ago at a cocktail party.
- |
  

- It was New York City 1999, I sat beside you, leaned close and spoke of my island, my dogs, my castle and the little well adjacent to my castle.
- |
  

- I spoke at length about the water in my well, of its clarity, purity and coolness.
- |
  

- You thought I spoke idly, for you were idle, but I did not speak idly.
- |
  

- I waited for this day, when I would have you on my island.
- |
  

- Now you are hungry, delirious, afraid, and in need of water.
- |
  

- I on the other hand am rested, alert, calm, and waiting in my tiger cage adjacent to my well.
- |
  

- My tiger cage is really more of an elaborate bluff.
- I will get you.
- |
  

- I killed a fox with a sling and ate its body raw.
- |
  

- The fur stuck in my teeth and coated my tongue.
- |
  

- I drew on my arms with soft coal, and wove fabrics out of the brush.
- |
  

- I dyed these fabrics various hues, using dyes made of vegetables and twigs.
- The fox meat sat heavy on my stomach.
- |
  

- I fell asleep and dreamed of our commencement, yours and mine, when we stood together on the lawn in our caps and gowns.
- |
  

- I was looking at the flag on its pole, watching it flap in the wind.
- |
  

- I told you I thought the way it flapped was majestic, and you agreed.
- |
  

- I reached into my pocket and removed a pack of gum.
- |
  

- I offered you a stick.
- |
  

- You accepted the stick.
- |
  

- I put the other stick, my stick, into my mouth, and I chewed it.
- The two of us chewed our gum.
- |
  

- When the flavor of my stick wore off, I removed it from my mouth, using my fingers, and I wrapped it in its original paper.
- |
  

- Then I let it be known that I would get you.
- |
  

- Today I made my own soap out of potash and oil.
- |
  

- I bathed myself in a tub lined with rocks, with water drawn from my well.
- |
  

- You will recall the freshness of my well water.
- |
  

- I imagine you are so thirsty now you would slice off your left pinky toe for a mere sip of my dirty bath water, water which I warmed with stones heated in my fire.
- |
  

- I bathed beneath the stars.
- |
  

- I washed my body with soap.
- |
  

- I picked out the constellation Orion, for that is the only constellation I can pick out, and I gazed at it as I soaped myself.
- |
  

- Next I dried myself on a towel that I brought from home.
- Fresh from my bath, I sat before the fire with a reed in my teeth and let free my thoughts.
- |
  

- I thought for a while about the sort of haircut I would like, and then my thoughts turned to the two of us, and I imagined things.
- We took a helicopter, you and I, to a musty motel room at the top of a tall, official building.
- |
  

- Our beds were side by side, divided by a Formica chest with a lamp on it.
- |
  

- I made your bed, and then I made my bed.
- |
  

- We fell asleep, and, in the morning we awoke.
- |
  

- I told you I didn't like our new apartment and you agreed, you said you didn't like it at all.
- These thoughts I had are neither here nor there.
- |
  

- Later, sitting at the edge of the well, waiting, I wrote a joke for my amusement.
- |
  

- I believe you will enjoy it.
- A man is driving through the long stretches of the West Texas highway.
- |
  

- He sees a billboard for a place called "Grandma's Whorehouse.
- "\" He has no interest in the whorehouse, at least not initially."
- |
  

- But time passes, and he passes several more signs.
- |
  

- By the time the man sees the twelfth sign, he is overcome by curiosity and, of course, self-deception.
- |
  

- He tells himself maybe grandma has a lot of hot granddaughters.
- |
  

- He pulls over.
- |
  

- He pays his money and walks down a curving hallway.
- |
  

- The lighting is harsh.
- |
  

- There are no tapestries on the wall.
- |
  

- He is frightened.
- |
  

- He comes to the end of the hallway, to a door outside.
- |
  

- He opens the door and reads a sign.
- |
  

- I haven't figured out what the sign will say yet.
- |
  

- Need I add that I will get you in complicated ways?
- I will get you in complicated ways.
- I have schemes all planned out up here.
- |
  

- And when I say "up here" I mean up in my head, which is very complicated and very advanced, more so than your own, which moves slowly. You are dim-witted. We know this. At times, you have admitted as much, when you have felt comfortable with me, and at home.
- I will get you.
- |
  

- I will get you in ways you don't expect, by seducing you, charming you, bringing you to my side where I can hold you, and keep you, and store you away in my cupboard, which has brass handles and is adorned with delicate paintings of beautiful ladies, and is where I keep some of my enemies.
- |
  

- I chased an antelope for hours.
- |
  

- Ultimately, I was dogged by it.
- |
  

- I fell to the ground and into the deepest sleep I have ever slept.
- |
  

- I still intend to get you in all the complicated ways I have spoken of above, but I would like to take a little break and confide in you right now.
- As I fell asleep last night, I imagined you and I were together in our new apartment.
- I found a room set above our room.
- |
  

- It was small and bathed in light.
- |
  

- I climbed into it.
- |
  

- "It was a kitchen with all the accoutrements: a thick wooden table made of different planks; copper pots; wines in a rack for wines."
- |
  

- The floor was gorgeous.
- |
  

- I told you it was perfect.
- |
  

- You agreed it was perfect, but you pointed out it was not ours.
- |
  

- Then I noticed all the Latino children running around.
- I cursed at length.
- |
  

- I cursed the children, and then I cursed you.
- |
  

- I compared your snaggle teeth to a fence and your skin to the pavement.
- |
  

- I compared your mother's hands to paws, and I recited the names of all your unrequited loves - people whom you loved, people who felt only disgust for you.
- |
  

- Hearing their names made you feel weak, sad and alone.
- |
  

- I spoke ill of your ancestors.
- |
  

- What happened next is still a blur, even to myself.
- |
  

- I was speaking of your mental defects, your dim wits.
- |
  

- The children were running between our legs.
- |
  

- I began to unfold my history.
- |
  

- I did it in a way that was sympathetic, but also honest.
- |
  

- I was careful neither to lacerate nor to coddle myself.
- |
  

- I spoke the simple truth, about myself, my exploits and my errors, and you were very moved.
- I began to chuckle softly.
- You asked me why I was chuckling, and I explained that, as I was speaking the simple truth about myself, I was also, in the back of my mind, working out an ending for grandma's whorehouse.
- "\"What will the sign say?"
- "\" you said."
- I said, "The sign will say, 'You have just been screwed, by Grandma.
- |
  

- You and I laughed.
- |
  

- We laughed and laughed.
- |
  

- We laughed for so long, I'd never laughed that long.
- |
  

- I slapped you on the back, and you slapped me on the back.
- |
  

- We laughed more.
- |
  

- I wondered when the laughter would end.
- |
  

- I bent over and gripped my knees, to try to contain the laughter.
- |
  

- You did the same - you copied - I didn't mind.
- |
  

- We stood hunched over shoulder-to-shoulder, hands on knees, laughing.
- |
  

- We laughed so long we forgot ourselves, and then we remembered, and still, we continued with the laughter, until we stopped, at which point I let you know I still had every intention of getting you.
- "Let me say it a final time, friend, just so we make sure we understand one another:"
- I will get you.
