- And then to come suddenly upon the impenetrable fortress of Nad  Elyauq, to fix bayonets and charge its granite walls screaming our lungs out,  only to realize it was a mirage, a vapor steaming from our heat-crazed brains&nbsp;&#151; I ask you, were these the actions of healthy men?
- But such is life in the Legion.

- "In  fact, most of the men in my company had enlisted for the same reason: to  forget my wife."

- After a few hellish days of basic training, we had forgotten  all about forgetting her and tried instead to forget our tormentor, Sergeant  Delgado.
- Delgado was a Spaniard, with olive skin and pimento eyes and jaws like  castanets.

- Rumor had it that he was a former bullfighter who had been ejected  from the ring for goring a fellow toreador.

- In the Legion his native cruelty  was given free rein, yet he was capable of surprising tenderness and concern  for our well-being.

- Delgado assembled us outside the mess and  confronted the thief.
- "\"Which is the guilty hand?"
- "\" the Sergeant asked."
- The man held out his left hand, which trembled violently right up to the  moment Delgado lopped it off with his saber.

- "As the Sergeant wiped the blade  on his pantaloons and turned to leave, the man hissed through teeth clenched  in agony:"
- "\"Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistake is all mine."

- I'm afraid my right  hand is the real culprit.
- The whole company fell silent, waiting for Delgado's customary obscenities  and the poor thief's instantaneous decapitation.

- Instead, the Sergeant wept  inconsolably and apologized, accepting all the blame and calling himself "a  first-class knucklehead.
- "\" Then, with infinite regret, he cut off the man's  other hand."

- We were profoundly moved.
- We learned the meaning of the Legion motto, "March or die," by carrying the  heaviest military backpacks in the world. Each was a carefully designed  desert survival kit containing blankets, sheets, a down comforter,  embroidered pillows, an easily assembled four-poster brass bed and canopy,  2000 rounds of ammunition, an extra rifle and bayonet, enough bricks to build  a walled fort, two liters of water, eight liters of whiskey, a copper cooking  pot, a side of beef, a side of pork, a side of hydrolyzed vegetable protein,  two complete extra uniforms and an extra Legionnaire.
- A man could march about five feet with this monstrosity on his back&nbsp;&#151; a  distance that increased to 50 miles at the point of Delgado's bayonet.

- To his  credit, the Sergeant led us every step of the way, though due to a severe  case of corns he had to be carried on a velvet litter while we marched and  sang.
- Legionnaires love to sing, particularly their theme song, "Le Boudin"  (literally, "the blood sausage").

- During Maurice Chevalier's little-known  enlistment in the 1920s, higher-ups considered changing the theme to "You  Brought a New Kind of Love to Me." But then Chevalier was dishonorably  discharged for creating an "obscene public display" (he removed the veil from  the wife of a local sheik), and the idea was dropped.

  followed that slavering martinet Sergeant Delgado over miles of molten dunes

  saliva? And then to come suddenly upon the impenetrable fortress of Nad 
  Elyauq, to fix bayonets and charge its granite walls screaming our lungs out,

  But such is life in the Legion. One minute reclining at the Casbah beneath 
  waving palm fronds as dark-eyed concubines ply you with figs and potent 
  liqueurs; the next minute finding these same sweet maidens have parted your 
  hair with a scimitar.
  Like so many others, I first joined the Legion to forget a woman: my wife. In 
  fact, most of the men in my company had enlisted for the same reason: to 
  forget my wife. After a few hellish days of basic training, we had forgotten 
  all about forgetting her and tried instead to forget our tormentor, Sergeant 
  Delgado.
  Delgado was a Spaniard, with olive skin and pimento eyes and jaws like 
  castanets. Rumor had it that he was a former bullfighter who had been ejected 
  from the ring for goring a fellow toreador. In the Legion his native cruelty 
  was given free rein, yet he was capable of surprising tenderness and concern 
  for our well-being. Once a private on the verge of starvation stole a crust 
  of bread from the commissary (a serious offense in the Legion, where snacking 
  between meals is forbidden). Delgado assembled us outside the mess and 
  confronted the thief.
  "Which is the guilty hand?" the Sergeant asked.
  The man held out his left hand, which trembled violently right up to the 
  moment Delgado lopped it off with his saber. As the Sergeant wiped the blade 
  on his pantaloons and turned to leave, the man hissed through teeth clenched 
  in agony:
