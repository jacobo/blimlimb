lines: 
- Last night, Rome burned again.
- |
  

- Even as Limp Bizkit fiddled, or rapped, or  whatever it is those kids do, the hamlet of Rome, New York, was inflamed and in flames.
- |
  

- And all I could do this time was shake my head as I watched the violence, the mayhem, unfold before me on MTV.
- |
  

- Woodstock 99?
- |
  

- Ha.
- |
  

- Woodschlock, perhaps.
- This is not rock'n'roll.
- I write these words on a Monday morning in late July, as I gaze out the window, past my iMac and my mug of Timorese roast, to my farm, 50 miles from Rome, New York.
- |
  

- "And I am telling myself: Those times -- our peace, our community -- thou art lost and gone forever."
- Sure, I went to Woodstock.
- |
  

- The first time.
- |
  

- Sure, it was fun.
- |
  

- But before the year was over, before the 1960s were finally trampled by Nixon and Vietnam and the Partridges, I was transformed by something else entirely.
- Altamont.
- Say it with me.
- |
  

- Al-ta-mont.
- |
  

- How my heart aches!
- |
  

- The High Peak, its Pacific spray, its amber sunsets, its incense and fingerdrums and corncob pipes.
- |
  

- And how Shannon Mulligan and I drove West, from a Columbia sit-in, in a Beetle stuffed with dope and Dylan.
- |
  

- For it was at Altamont that I lost my  innocence.
- |
  

- There, Shannon took my face in her hands, with a beatific smile, and kissed me during the opening notes of "Jumpin' Jack Flash.
- "\" And whispered mots doux during the finale of \""
- Street Fighting Man.
- "\" And in between, when the Rolling Stones roared through \""
- Under My Thumb," Shannon  and I watched a boy our age, ten feet away -- a boy in a green suit, with a pistol in his hand -- Shannon and I watched a Hell's Angel stab him to death.
- |
  

- A boy we'd never know.
- This morning, my friend Jann, an editor at a magazine about music and politics, called to ask if I could cover the anniversary of another rock'n'roll show.
- |
  

- I was all set to protest before he hooked me in with an  irresistible phrase.
- |
  

- "\"Altamont '99,\""
- |
  

- Altamont '99.
- |
  

- I couldn't go back.
- |
  

- Yet I knew I must.
- "\"Dad, I can't see."
- "\" Poor Dustin was rubbing his eyes."
- |
  

- We'd only been at Altamont for a few minutes, but the sound was already deafening; I could barely hear him through my earplugs.
- |
  

- Truth be told, I couldn't see much myself.
- |
  

- Whose idea, we all asked ourselves on December 6, 1969 -- whose crazy idea was it, anyway, to stage a Rolling Stones concert at an obscure little dragstrip near Livermore, California?
- |
  

- Whose idea was it to commemorate a horrific nightmare resulting in four deaths and countless injuries and a harrowing documentary film?
- Today, I ask myself another question too.
- |
  

- Where are the Stones?
- That was my first disappointment, I must confess.
- |
  

- The notion of watching Mick Jagger, who turned 56 on July 26, when I began writing these words, strutting like a rooster 30 years later -- it was an intoxicating idea, and I told Jann I'd give him the best concert story he'd ever seen.
- |
  

- Jann was thrilled, and he said he'd fire off the plane tickets immediately.
- |
  

- "But in an email, he cautioned me: \"Not sure the Stones are gonna make it."
- |
  

- Things might be a little different this time around at Altamont.
- He wasn't kidding.
- |
  

- The Hell's Angels are still here, but today, instead of beating people up, they're handing out bottles of water and flyers on safe sex.
- |
  

- At least the fans are still undulating and unruly, restless with untapped anger and hostility over a political system that keeps them oppressed.
- |
  

- But this time, MTV's got the event locked up, handling the stabbing reenactment with Daisy Fuentes and DJ Jesse Kamp.
- |
  

- They'd been taking applications for the victim since March, apparently.
- |
  

- "And onstage, doing their techno-hiphop \"Under My Thumb '99\": Ricky Martin and Britney Spears."
- When Dustin heard I'd be going to see Ricky and Britney play, he nearly jumped out of his skin.
- |
  

- He's staying with his mom this summer, but she couldn't deny him such excitement.
- |
  

- And how could I resist turning my own son on?
- |
  

- How could I avoid bringing a new generation to Altamont?
- Oh, Altamont.
- I scooped Dustin up and plunked him on my shoulders.
- |
  

- He clapped and squealed, and all around us were amused faces, touching this old '60s salty dog, this draft-dodging, pot-smoking liberal -- and his son.
- Then my shoulder gave out.
- |
  

- I felt it pop, and so did Dustin.
- |
  

- "\"Uh, Dad?"
- "\" he said."
- |
  

- I was in such agony I couldn't even answer him.
- |
  

- "\"Dad!"
- "\" People cleared away as he jumped off."
- |
  

- He reached down and started massaging my shoulder,  and within a minute he'd popped it back into place.
- |
  

- Three teenagers, a little younger than him, smiled at us.
- "\"Dustin,\""
- |
  

- I gasped at last, "I think maybe you're getting a little too old for me to be doing that.
- "\" He smiled sadly and nodded."
- |
  

- "\"It's OK, Dad,\""
- |
  

- "\"I can hear the music at least."
- |
  

- And it sounds even better than it does in my car.
- Britney and Ricky were grooving along, singing that "Livin' La Vida Loca"  as a high-energy duet. It must've lasted ten minutes as they introduced the band -- none of the players a day over 20, I'd guess. And then that roar.
- That roar.
- |
  

- Dustin and I stood on our toes.
- |
  

- Daisy and Jesse came bopping out onto the stage.
- "\"OK, who's ready to get stabbed?"
- "\" shouted Daisy."
- |
  

- The crowd surged forward.
- |
  

- There were shaved-headed kids, tumbling over the crowd, arms outstretched, wiry as whippets.
- |
  

- Girls were squealing, waving toy pistols in the air.
- |
  

- I could hardly believe this, but a boy next to us stood languidly, a smirk on his face.
- |
  

- He was wearing a green suit.
- A green suit just like the green suit from 30 years before.
- |
  

- "\"Dad!"
- |
  

- Check out the video screens!
- I looked up at the Bank of America screens on both sides of the stage, and the face of the boy next to us filled them.
- |
  

- His digital smile was a hundred feet wide.
- |
  

- The crowd parted before him like a Biblical sea, and he stepped forward.
- |
  

- The Hell's Angels pushed the crowd back and ushered him up the steps.
- The boy in the green suit high-fived Ricky Martin.
- |
  

- He hugged Britney Spears.
- |
  

- He got a kiss from Daisy Fuentes and did an elaborate routine with Jesse Kamp including a soul-shake, a cartwheel, a headbutt, and what looked like a step from the Hustle.
- "\"You ready, dude?"
- "\" Britney and Ricky were beaming."
- |
  

- Daisy did some kind of  jumping-jack flash.
- |
  

- Jesse held the glinting knife.
- |
  

- "On screen, we could see the boy in the green suit smirking the words: \""
- Dude, let's get it on.
- I watched Dustin instead.
- |
  

- Watched his face light up the way a telephone switchboard could be said to light up like a Christmas tree.
- |
  

- Watched his eyes widen the way eyes are often said to widen like saucers.
- |
  

- Of course, I couldn't hear anything but cheers.
- |
  

- Endless, deafening cheers.
- And once again, Altamont was over.
- Altamont is over, again.
- Altamont is never, ever over.
