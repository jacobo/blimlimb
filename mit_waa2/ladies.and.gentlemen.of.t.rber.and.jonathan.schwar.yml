  Alternative Theory #2: A Strong Wind
  The litigant's injuries occurred when an object was blown into his
  rectum by
  a fierce wind. Just as tornados have been known to embed straw in the
  trunks
  of trees, or force chickens unharmed into jugs, a localized, extremely
  powerful disturbance -- what meterologists call a "microburst" -- easily
  could have launched a plunger, broomstick, or what-have-you into the
  rear-end
  of Mr. Louima. Whether this was consensual or not is a question only he
  can
  answer.
  Alternative Theory #3: Accidental
  The litigant slipped on soap in the shower. Such accidents are
  embarrassing,
  but hardly uncommon. Means: a back-scrubber. Motive: clumsiness.
  Opportunity:
  bathtime. Case closed.
  Alternative Theory #4: Voodoun
  It is well known that many Haitians practice "voodoun," a religion
  believed to have been
  brought to the Western Hemisphere from Africa. Who is to say
  that Mr. Louima's injuries are not the result of some frenzied, unholy
  ritual? Or that they did not occur when one of the litigant's many
  enemies created a doll in his likeness, the buttocks of which were then
  jabbed repeatedly with a sharp pin?
  (Please note: As unwholesome as Mr. Louima's practices may seem to us,
  let us remember that they are protected by our country's First
  Amendment.)
  Alternative Theory #5: Self-inflicted
  The litigant was using a stick to retrieve something he had inserted in
  himself earlier for safekeeping -- his car keys, for example, or a
  valuable
  family heirloom -- and lost his grip. While this may seem farfetched, we
  do well to remember that the precise circumstances which led to Mr.
  Louima's injuries are limited  only by the human imagination , while the
  prosecution would have us believe that just one truth -- THEIR truth --
  is the only truth. Perhaps it is Mr. Louima who has behaved
  irresponsibly,
  not Officer Volpe. Perhaps it is Mr. Louima, a guest in our country, who
  is
  forcing the wooden stick of false accusations up Officer Volpe's
  metaphorical
  heinie.
  Alternative Theory #6: Amadou Diallo
  Amadou Diallo caused the injuries to the litigant during overly-vigorous
  
  albeit consensual sex. An outraged Mr. Louima responded by shooting at
  him 41 times, 19 of which struck home. A crime of passion, plain and
  simple.
