- Eastern Mediterranean fare is hot and few are doing it better, or more creatively, than Santorini's.

- "At this airy new restaurant, everyday ingredients mingle with the more worldly: Meyer lemons jazz up a Tunisian carrot pur\xE9e, while goat cheese greets sumac, onions, and tzatziki."

- I'm sure these would all be great dishes if dairy, root vegetables, and citrus were not allergens to me.
- |
  

- The kitchen is both eclectic and innovative, so if you're seeking the usual suspects of hummus and spanakopita, you may be disappointed.
- |
  

- You may also be disappointed if eating "food," as most people define it, causes a violent reaction of sweating, hives, and blurry vision.
- "Judging by the satisfied looks of the other patrons, everything was delicious or \"to die for\"\x97or \"sooooo good,\" as my dining companion said over and over."
- |
  

- The group at the table next to ours delighted in encountering unusual appetizers, like arnipita, crispy dough stuffed with lamb, feta, and mint.
- |
  

- The glass of water (no ice; I'm allergic) I used to wash down a steady stream of Claritin seemed to pale in comparison.
- Santorini's pleases loyal locals and out-of-towners alike, going out of their way to accommodate special requests.
- |
  

- A pomegranate-and-lime sorbet that's not on the menu for the couple on their anniversary dinner?
- |
  

- No problem!
- |
  

- But Santorini's was less successful accommodating patrons seeking to substitute food items on the menu with nonfood items.
- "You won't break the budget\x97especially if you order nothing\x97and moderate prices leave room for a bottle of 1994 Ch\xE2teau Musar, one of several unusual wines that I'm told pair well with this cuisine."
- Because reds, unlike whites, only cause uncontrollable facial tics and my eyes to swell shut, I went for it.

- The good news is that this charming find is four blocks from St.

- Elizabeth's Hospital, where the emergency-room nurses and physicians were as charming and attentive as Stefano, Irene, and the entire wait staff at Santorini's.
