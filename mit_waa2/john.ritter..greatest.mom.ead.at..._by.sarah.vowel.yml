  "Ted" was a great episode. It was  Buffy the Vampire Slayer 's second (and best) season. When Buffy met Ted, the computer software salesman played by John Ritter, he was making out with her mother in the kitchen. Talk about horror! (The scoring music was especially funny when Buffy walked in on Mom and Ted mid-mash &#8212; violins on loan from  Psycho. )
  Buffy was about three weeks away from losing her virginity to the good vampire Angel, who, thanks to a gypsy curse that would take away his soul if he ever achieved perfect happiness (i.e., sleeping with Buffy), would lose his soul and revert to demon form. So Angel turned evil, tormenting Buffy and trying to kill her. And if that wasn't bad enough, he started smoking. Thus, in one of the show's many grand allegories, in which real life emotional traumas are accurately represented by fanciful monsters: girl has sex with nice boy, nice boy wakes up the next morning all weird and distant and mean.
  Anyway, Ted. Casting Ritter as Ted was genius &#8212; he was doughy and pleasant and wonderfully innocuous. The delight of this episode is that Ritter is so game. Clearly, the man had a dark streak. Ted has won over Buffy's mother and her best friends by plying them with homemade cookies and platitudes. Sounding squeaky clean, he puts on his best Oprah, telling Buffy, "I know you're the most important person in [your mother's] life and, well, gosh, that makes you pretty important to me too." Ritter nails that "gosh." Plus, Ted, whose cooking is drooled over by everyone but Buffy, stands at the stove making what might be the most emasculated food item since the arrival of the hideous neologism "veggie"; something called a "mini-pizza."
  Buffy, who has seen more than her share of bad guys, sees this mommy-kisser for who he is: evil, telling her friends, "So far, all I see is someone who apparently has a good job, seems nice and polite and my mother really likes him."
  "What kind of a monster is he?" cracks Xander, one of her sidekicks.
  The kind of monster, it turns out, who laces his cooking with tranquilizers and a pinch of ecstasy, drugging anyone who eats his handiwork into a shiny happy Ted-worshipping lull.
