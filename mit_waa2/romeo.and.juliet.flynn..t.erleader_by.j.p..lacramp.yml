- Verona High's evening study hall.
- "ROMEO: Her eyes in heaven"
- Would through the airy region stream so bright
- That birds would sing and think it were not night.
- See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
- O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
- That I might touch that cheek!
- "JULIET: Shut up, retard."
- |
  

- You get near my cheek and I'll rip your airy region out.
- "ROMEO: She speaks."
- O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art
- As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
- "As is a wing\xE8d messenger of heaven ."
- |
  

- "JULIET: I said  shut up , retard."
- |
  

- You smell like Doritos.
- |
  

- And do you  mind  sitting a little further away?
- |
  

- I can feel your stupid Dorito breath on my face.
- "ROMEO: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
- "JULIET: Listen, Creepoid, my older brother's a linebacker on the varsity squad\x97and he just  loves  to beat up the creepoids that bother me."
- "ROMEO: I take thee at thy word!"
- "JULIET: I know you: Hienkles, right?"
- |
  

- Your sister's a bitch.
- |
  

- Did you know that, Nacho Breath?
- |
  

- You're related to a walrus-faced ho sack.
- "ROMEO: My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself"
- Because it is an enemy to thee.
- Had I it written, I would tear the word.
- "JULIET: Whatevs."
- |
  

- Don't you play tuba in the stupid jazz band, or something even gayer, like the oboe?
- "ROMEO: Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike."
- "JULIET: You're weirding me out, Cheese 'Stache."
- |
  

- "And you better not be the sicko that's been peeking into my bedroom window\x97my dad and brothers are going to crunch the cookies out of that guy."
- "ROMEO: Thy kinsmen are no stop to me."
- "JULIET: OK."
- |
  

- "Let me just  explain  something:  My older brother benches, like, 325\x97in his sleep."
- |
  

- With the flu.
- |
  

- Plus, my dad has a collection of crazy-sharp Japanese swords that he got from the emperor or somebody.
- |
  

- Like 15 of them.
- "ROMEO: Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye"
- Than 20 of their swords.
- "JULIET: My brothers are going to shit  honey  over this."
- |
  

- You know it's tough playing the oboe with broken thumbs, don't you?
- "ROMEO: My life were better ended by their hate"
- "Than death prorogu\xE8d, wanting of thy love."
- "JULIET: Jeez, could your fingernails be any longer?"
- |
  

- You disgust me.
- |
  

- Go away.
- "ROMEO: Wert thou as far"
- As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea,
- I should adventure for such merchandise.
- "JULIET: Shut up."
- |
  

- And why is your hair so greasy?
- |
  

- God, you're grosser than a bag of bear shit.
- |
  

- Go tell Blake to come over here.
- |
  

- And  move  to where I can't smell your corn chips and hair juice.
- "ROMEO: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
- "JULIET: Seriously, what do you want to leave me alone?"
- "ROMEO: Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
- "JULIET: OK ."
- |
  

- Fine.
- I .
- |
  

- I .
- |
  

- Not .
- God, you're so stupid and gross.
- You dumb oboe player.
- "ROMEO: Wouldst thou withdraw it?"
- |
  

- For what purpose, love?
- "JULIET: Because your fingers are orange,"
- And you smell like fake cheese.
- How many bags of Doritos did you eat?
- |
  

- Like 10?
- Oh, my God!
- |
  

- Are you  crying ?
- What are you crying for, you stupid baby?
- Hey, Blake!
- |
  

- "Blake, listen:"
- Hienkles sounds just like a blubbering walrus.
- Arrf, arrf, arrf.
- Arrf, arrf, arrf.
- "OK, that's enough\x97"
- It's not really funny anymore.
- Jeez, you know, even for a stalker, you're  really  emotional.
- |
  

- "Now here: shut up and do my civics homework."
- "ROMEO: O bless\xE8d, bless\xE8d night!"
- |
  

- I am afeard,
- Being in night, all this is but a dream,
- Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
- "JULIET: I said  shut up , retard."
- Exeunt.
