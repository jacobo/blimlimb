- According to  The Terminator , in the future, time travel will be perfected, but it will only work on humans or flesh-covered appliances; fabric is out of the question.

- The bad news is, the khakis didn't.
- Signs
- If I understand things correctly, Mel Gibson is a cleric who regains his faith in God after he realizes that his wife, in her dying moments, gave him a message that was too cryptic and oblique to save the lives of millions of people during an alien attack, but was just specific enough to save his son.

- This may be the most narrow definition of a miracle, ever.
