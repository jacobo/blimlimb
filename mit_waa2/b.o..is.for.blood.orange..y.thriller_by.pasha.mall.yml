- A car chases another car on a winding mountain road, very recklessly and very fast.

- "A car chase, how exciting\x97and the movie's just begun!"
- A Paris museum is being robbed.

- A team of burglars descend on cables in the dark.

- In the morning, the spy wakes up to discover himself still lashed to the bed, but now surrounded by secret agents.

- |
  

- The spy writhes in his restraints.
- |
  

- "\"Where is it?"

- A camel and a Bedouin are moseying down the streets of Marrakech.
- |
  

- At a stall selling stolen Parisian art, the camel turns to the Bedouin and says, "I guess this is where I leave you.
- "\" Except the Bedouin isn't a Bedouin at all but a secret agent wearing towels and fake beards, and he pulls out a revolver and guns the happy camel down."
- |
  

- "The camel falls on a neighboring market stall selling oranges and the oranges tumble everywhere, through the camel's spurting blood, and\x97historical fact\x97that's how blood oranges were invented, in 1942."
- Someone put a grenade somewhere!
- |
  

- Get him!
- A femme fatale wakes up to the head of her lover on the pillow beside her!
- |
  

- But the rest of his body is there, too, under the sheets.
- |
  

- So no big deal.
- Through the desert troop a bunch of thirsty camels.
- |
  

- They come upon a Bedouin casually lounging by an oasis, eating a blood orange, surrounded by stolen art.
- |
  

- "\"Careful,\""
- |
  

- "\"I've heard about this guy."
- A Bedouin explodes!
- A femme fatale, a secret agent in camel disguise, a regular camel, and an ostrich walk into a bar in Marrakech.
- |
  

- "\"Four blood-orange martinis,\""
- |
  

- Arthur.
- |
  

- In walks Number One, in disguise as a femme fatale.
- |
  

- "\"Oh my God, we're wearing the same dress!"
- "\" screams Number One, flapping his arms as a diversionary tactic."
- |
  

- But the ostrich misinterprets the gesture as mockery and falls into a deep, inconsolable fit of sobbing.
- |
  

- "\"Next round's on the house,\""
- |
  

- Arthur.
- |
  

- And he means it.
- "\"Is that a blood orange,\""
- |
  

- "\"or are you just happy to see me?"
- "\" Blackhawk Davidson blinks and looks down at his erection."
- |
  

- "\"It's,\""
- |
  

- Back in the library, Blackhawk Davidson pulls a book off a shelf.
- |
  

- Nothing happens.
- |
  

- "But then he looks at the book:  Baby Disguises and You, Wearing Them ."
- |
  

- Out of nowhere appears Number One.
- |
  

- "\"That book might save your life someday,\""
- |
  

- Number One.
- |
  

- "Blackhawk Davidson notices the revolver pointed at his \"blood orange\"\x97which he'd rather not have \"peeled,\" as it were."
- |
  

- Number One a double agent?
- |
  

- Fancy that!
- A car chase through the narrow streets of a picturesque Mediterranean town!
- |
  

- "Wait, not a car chase\x97a funeral procession, very slow and very sad."
- Blackhawk Davidson is home safely with his family in London, feet up on a coffee table.
- |
  

- The phone rings.
- |
  

- It's the new Number One (formerly Number Three, promoted over Number Two because of affirmative action).
- |
  

- And as the new Number One congratulates Blackhawk Davidson on another job well done the camera pans over the coffee table, where a book about baby disguises sits proudly displayed, a silver bullet lodged in its cover.
