- Are your legs tired?
- |
  

- Because you've been running through my mind all day.
- |
  

- Just remember to stay plenty hydrated.
- |
  

- "We are in a bar, and drinking alcohol\x97though it may seem counterintuitive\x97can lead to dehydration."
- |
  

- After all, it's a diuretic.
- |
  

- So if you were running all day and now you're drinking martinis, you could be in danger without even realizing it.
- |
  

- Are you having headaches?
- |
  

- Is your urine dark?
- |
  

- Where are you going?
- |
  

- If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.
- |
  

- But I'd probably just give you a quick glance and then switch the alphabet back to the correct order.
- |
  

- I mean, children today have enough to worry about without us changing the alphabet on them.
- |
  

- What's that in your eye?
- |
  

- Must just be a twinkle.
- |
  

- But if it is in fact a piece of glass, we've got a problem.
- |
  

- Corneal abrasions can be painful, let me tell you.
- |
  

- Someone get me some water, we'll try to flush it out.
- |
  

- Now blink a few times.
- |
  

- That's it.
- |
  

- Work with me here, it's better just to be safe.
- |
  

- You must be a heck of a thief, because you stole my heart from across the room.
- |
  

- I'm not going to report it, though, because our state is pretty tough on theft.
- |
  

- A little too tough, if you ask me.
- |
  

- And the rate of recidivism, particularly for stealing, is chilling.
- |
  

- We need reform.
- |
  

- You must be a light switch, because every time I see you, you turn me on.
- |
  

- And I'm not so sure that's a good thing, what with global warming and all.
- |
  

- I try to leave the lights off as much as possible, and definitely if I'm not in the room at the time.
- |
  

- I even shut down my computer every night.
- |
  

- You'd be surprised how the little things can make a big difference.
- |
  

- Have you used those energy-efficient light bulbs?
- |
  

- If you were words on a page, you'd be what they call "fine print.
- "\" Now, that's not to say you are the much maligned and oft-ignored small-print disclaimer that the legal department of many companies slip in toward the bottom of their ads to stipulate the limitations of their offers."
- |
  

- I was just using a little wordplay with "
- |
  

- Do you have a Band-Aid?
- |
  

- Because I just scraped my knee falling for you.
- |
  

- Do you have any hydrogen peroxide?
- |
  

- Maybe one of those alcohol wipes?
- |
  

- I don't want my knee to turn into a festering cesspool of bacteria.
- |
  

- And I definitely don't want to get blood on that pretty dress of yours.
- |
  

- What time do you have to be back in heaven?
- |
  

- I'm not suggesting you're dead or that you look dead or even that you believe in the afterlife.
- |
  

- I was just referencing the widely accepted notion that heaven (regardless of the religion) is a utopia.
- |
  

- And since a utopia is a perfect place and everything in it is perfect, I just thought you'd be from there.
- |
  

- Do you have a map?
- |
  

- Because I keep getting lost in your eyes.
- |
  

- When I come into a little money, I swear I'm going to buy one of those GPS navigation systems.
- |
  

- I get so frazzled when I lose my bearings and then things snowball because I'm totally disoriented and I get more and more lost.
- |
  

- Hold me, I'm scared.
