- Saturday.
- |
  

- I arrived at Kitchen early, 7:25 p.m.
- |
  

- The General Manager Ken Ebner was bent over his schedule book at the end of the bar and gave me a staccato nod.
- |
  

- Arranged on the bar around him was a mobile telephone in its perforated leather holster, a hand-held computer, a red marble ashtray full of scotch mints, and a key ring, attached to a miniature vodka bottle.
- |
  

- Ken often took up the ring, which was heavy with keys, twirled it around in his hand, and set it down noisily.
- |
  

- I arrived at the same time as Mitch Manseau, another Security Assistant, who had a bruise on his cheek.
- |
  

- The bartender Mary placed two pint glasses of ice water in front of us.
- |
  

- Ken looked up from his schedule book and noticed Mitch's bruise.
- "\"He hit you first?"
- "\" he asked."
- "\"I wasn't hit!"
- "\" Mitch said."
- |
  

- "\"I fell!"
- Ken looked doubtful.
- "\"My new girlfriend takes me jogging yesterday,\""
- |
  

- Mitch said.
- |
  

- "\"She's a personal trainer."
- |
  

- A jogging freak.
- |
  

- Runs marathons and triathlons!
- |
  

- She's like, 'Okay muscleman, let's see how you jog!
- |
  

- So she takes me though the ravine.
- |
  

- Not jogging.
- |
  

- Full-out  sprinting .
- |
  

- "I told her before we left: I'm like not a jogger."
- |
  

- I don't do cardio.
- |
  

- I lift weights, I work out, but I don't do cardio.
- |
  

- So after 20 minutes of trying to keep up with her through valleys full of rocks, I slip on a rock and fall.
- |
  

- She keeps running.
- |
  

- I'm lying with my face in mud.
- |
  

- She jogs back.
- |
  

- What's wrong?
- |
  

- I'm like&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;once again&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;' I don't do cardio .
- |
  

- Then I puke!
- Midway through Mitch's story, Ken began to play with his key ring, while swiftly and repeatedly consulting his hand-held computer.
- |
  

- He punched a tiny button when the device emitted a just-audible grinding sound.
- |
  

- "\"You meet her here?"
- "\" Ken asked."
- Mitch abruptly ceased drinking his water and coughed.
- |
  

- "\"Meet who here?"
- "\"Your new girlfriend who took you jogging when you fell on your face in the ravine."
- |
  

- Did you meet her at Kitchen?
- "\"Yeah!"
- |
  

- Sure, I met her here.
- |
  

- Friends with Carlo.
- "\"You guys are on shift,\""
- |
  

- Ken.
- |
  

- Sunday.
- |
  

- When I arrived home, Jennifer was watching TV with the sound turned off.
- "\"You're up late,\""
- |
  

- I said.
- "\"I'm always up late."
- |
  

- "But still you say: 'You're up late!"
- |
  

- "\"What are you watching?"
- "\"I don't know."
- |
  

- Something stupid.
- |
  

- Monday.
- |
  

- Tonight a guy got past Mitch at the door, and did Ken ever get on Mitch's back about it.
- |
  

- You'd think that in a big club like Kitchen, patronized by thousands of dancers every weekend, mistakes might get lost in the sea of bodies, but it is not so.
- |
  

- Ken had seen everything.
- After we closed, Ken bawled Mitch out in front of everyone.
- |
  

- Even Mary ceased cashing out the bar to listen.
- "This was Ken:"
- "\"He paid no cover, Mitch, and he stayed here the  whole night ."
- |
  

- I found him at 1:36 a.m.
- |
  

- Carlo throw him out.
- |
  

- He lied about being on the guest list, got past you, talked his way into the DJ booth.
- |
  

- He also got several of his  friends  past you.
- |
  

- I saw them dancing in a circle, radiating violently toward other dancers.
- |
  

- It's known as swarming, Mitch.
- |
  

- On the Kitchen dance floor!
- |
  

- How did it happen, Mitch?
- "\"I don't know, Ken!"
- "\" Mitch looked around at the rest of us."
- |
  

- "\"They all had those plastic card things around their necks."
- Ken ignored him.
- |
  

- "\"You know what this kind of negligence leads to?"
- "\" He stood erect, his phone and hand-held computer clamped to his belt."
- |
  

- He wore baggy khakis and a silk golf shirt.
- |
  

- His arms extended fully at his sides; one hand looked about to grip an invisible gun from a holster, while the other held his key ring, with its miniature vodka bottle, delicately between thumb and forefinger.
- |
  

- Ken looked at us.
- |
  

- The keys did not rattle.
- |
  

- "\"That's right,\""
- |
  

- "\"It leads to out-of-control dance floor swarming."
- "\"Everybody familiar with a midtown club called Boiler Room?"
- |
  

- Does everybody remember Boiler Room, August 20, 1998?
- |
  

- No? Don't remember?
- |
  

- Memory a little foggy?
- |
  

- Well, I guess that means you weren't at Boiler Room, on August 20, 1998, because if you had been, you'd remember 10:10 p.m.
- |
  

- August 20, 1998, at Boiler Room.
- "\"Their night staff let known dance floor swarmers&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;a whole gang of them&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;through the doors."
- |
  

- Now, this gang wasn't that smart.
- |
  

- These gentlemen came in separately, instead of all at the same time.
- |
  

- Is that smart?
- |
  

- It's not dumb, but it's not that smart either.
- |
  

- Point is, Boiler Room Security Assistants did not keep their eyes on these gentlemen.
- |
  

- They did not realize that they were a gang of swarmers.
- "\"Anyway, that gang commences with a dance floor swarm."
- |
  

- They radiate violently.
- |
  

- At 12:50 a.m.
- |
  

- They shut the place down.
- |
  

- Ambulances arrived.
- |
  

- Six Boiler Room patrons are treated for serious dance floor injuries due to swarming.
- |
  

- City shuts Boiler Room down.
- |
  

- Victims sue management.
- We stood in silence.
- |
  

- We had forgotten about Mitch's mistake and so, it seemed, had Ken.
- |
  

- He shook his key ring at us, as if it were a handkerchief and he was sending us off with a grudging blessing and best wishes.
