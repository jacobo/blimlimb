- Wow!
- |
  

- I just got back from the Purple Door, and I'm exhausted!
- |
  

- The phrase "shit-canned" comes to mind, but I don't know if that covers it. Here's the deal. I was sitting at a table listening to an Irish band playing a wide range of music, from old sailor ditties to Irish blues, with a few Bob Dylan and Van Morrison covers. Some people were dancing but most were hanging out at tables and listening. I was drinking beer and trying not to think too much, just playing with the bandage on my finger. All of a sudden I see Rose McGowan&#151;that's right, Rose McGowan&#151;sitting across the room with a bunch of her goth friends.
- I was on my third beer, and while I wasn't ready to start doing wall push-ups, I was feeling good and loose.
- |
  

- The loud music made the brick walls expand with each beat.
- |
  

- Hot blood pulsed in my ears.
- |
  

- Given my New Year's resolution to act on impulse, I had no choice but to get up and introduce myself to the starlet.
- |
  

- No staggering, no spilling, just a straight walk to the table, a tap on the shoulder, and a quick "Excuse me, but I really enjoy your body of work.
- "\" Her goth friends stared at me with that bleary look that concentration camp victims give to a photographer through barbed wire."
- |
  

- I needed a couple more beers.
- It's taken me a long time to figure out what most guys learned in high school, distinguished reader, and here it is&#151;chicks dig confidence.
- |
  

- They like guys to be sensitive, yes, and gentle, maybe, but only after a show of strength.
- |
  

- No matter what anyone tells you, a sensitive guy who fails to show strength is at best a friend.
- |
  

- So no matter how badly I cowered inside, I knew that any expression of contempt must be countered with cocksureness.
- |
  

- No more emotional beat-downs.
- |
  

- "So that's when I said it:"
- "\"You wanna dance?"
- I half-smiled, nonchalant, as if I were asking a child come down from a tree.
- |
  

- Take it or leave it, kid&#151;this is your only chance.
- |
  

- Rose shot a big smile at one of her friends, a pasty guy with black hair and one constricted pupil.
- |
  

- As she arose from her chair, I tried not to act shocked.
- |
  

- For a brief moment, I wanted to run out of the bar, get on a bus, not go any deeper.
- |
  

- I put the beer down, hopped onto a platform, and started dancing.
- |
  

- I knew I had to put my best foot forward, as the saying goes.
- |
  

- The band was playing a upbeat ditty, so I combined a toe-tapping jig with my best belly dance moves.
- Rose McGowan's a dancer.
- |
  

- She said something to me that I couldn't hear, so I flapped the back of my ear, shrugged, and kept dancing.
- |
  

- When the song ended, she leaned close and asked my name.
- |
  

- "\"Daniel,\""
- |
  

- I shouted.
- |
  

- I have no idea why I said Daniel.
- |
  

- The band worked into a new song with a slower groove.
- |
  

- I told Rose to dance with her arms up high, like this, and when she did so I sidled up to her and grooved around her.
- |
  

- "\"Oh when the ship comes in,\""
- |
  

- "\"You'll see me lass come smilin'."
- "\" We had something going, Rose and I. It felt like everyone was watching us, even the band."
- |
  

- Getting down, hooking up.
- It didn't happen for us.
- |
  

- It turns out the guy with the constricted pupil was more than just a friend to Rose.
- |
  

- He hopped onto the platform and said something to Rose that I couldn't hear.
- |
  

- I just saw his black lips contorting in anger.
- |
  

- She seemed put off, and that's when I realized they had a history.
- |
  

- She emasculated him by calling him a woman's name and told him to go away.
- |
  

- Rose was no woman with whom to be trifled.
- |
  

- I was dancing slowly, wondering whether to jump in and tell the guy to buzz off or to let Rose sort things out herself&#151;the same old paralyzing collision between chivalry and feminism.
- The band moved into a faster song.
- |
  

- "\"There once was a bloke named McQuiver,\""
- |
  

- "\"Who took to his drink by the river."
- "\" The guy with the constricted pupil made his play."
- |
  

- He wedged himself between us and began dancing slowly with his back to me.
- |
  

- I grabbed his tiny shoulders and slowly but firmly moved him aside.
- |
  

- Crazy, detached eyes stared at me from behind a pasty face.
- "\"Old Seamus ne'er said no to a feast,\""
- |
  

- "\"And drank whiskey like a Belfast Priest."
- |
  

- Time to dance.
- |
  

- I busted a lindy circle followed by a double spin.
- |
  

- The goth paused a beat and did the same step.
- |
  

- We eyed each other, as if for the first time.
- |
  

- I worked up a trade-slide block turn in skater's position, and he followed the move effortlessly, moving into a Frankie's Roll that consisted of a tap-back foot on the second beat, followed by a roll-roll-triple on four.
- |
  

- We were now dancing side by side.
- |
  

- I duplicated the block turn, working a stomach roll into the trade slide.
- |
  

- Other dancers moved aside and cheered each completed move.
- The goth and I were drenched with sweat.
- |
  

- Each dance move was equaled and bested in turn.
- |
  

- I jumped into a toe-click-heel-tap kickout that morphed into an old-time cabbage patch.
- |
  

- He took the cue, and we threw down a cabbage patch in sync, both of us working in a quarter turn every fourth beat.
- |
  

- When the song ended, the goth and I looked at each other with respect.
- |
  

- We hugged tightly, like two gladiators after a hard-fought draw, each of us so secure in his own masculinity that the groping of buttocks and genitals meant nothing more than an assessment of manliness.
- Then it turned nasty.
- |
  

- He  was there.
- Michael Flatley had been dogging me ever since I bested him in a contest last October.
- |
  

- He quit his tour and moved to Seattle to study my moves.
- |
  

- Some people never learn that victory or defeat means nothing compared to the assertion of will, and Michael is one of those people.
- |
  

- I can only assume that this failure&#151;combined with insane jealousy and wine coolers&#151;contributed to the wild haymaker he threw at me.
- |
  

- I ducked and slammed a fist into his gut, causing Mr. Flatley to double over.
- |
  

- Instead of finishing him off, I let him gather his wind.
- |
  

- Mistake.
- |
  

- He kicked my shin, put me in a headlock, and took the liberty of rapping his knuckle, hard, against the top of my head.
- |
  

- I'll say this for Mr. Flatley&#151;he's a scrapper.
- |
  

- I would have been done for if Rose hadn't pulled the Lord of the Dance off me and whisked him outside.
- Whew!
- |
  

- I need to wrap this up and get some sleep.
- |
  

- Anyway, to make a long story short, I talked my way out of being arrested and Rose McGowan is now dating my nemesis Michael Flatley.
- |
  

- I vow that we shall meet again.
- |
