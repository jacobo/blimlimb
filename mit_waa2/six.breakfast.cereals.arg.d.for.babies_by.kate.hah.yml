- Life
- Let's get real.
- |
  

- Unless you plan on keeping your kid in an ivory highchair forever, you have to teach him about sharp edges.
- |
  

- Problems don't dissolve as soon as your saliva touches them, like those flimsy  O s do.
- |
  

- Just try drooling all over that lien on your house and see how far it gets you.
- |
  

- I'm tough, stringy, and make your gums bleed.
- |
  

- That's why they call me Life.
- |
  

- I'll show your baby that he has to chew hard on challenges, and that mashing his enemies into a fibrous pulp is worth the pain.
- |
  

- Try me yourself.
- |
  

- Without milk.
- |
  

- Right now.
- |
  

- I dare you.
- Alpha-Bits
- Excuse me if I'm being presumptuous, but I assume that you, as a parent, are aware of the declining literacy rate in this country.
- |
  

- "This can be blamed on what I call  O -verexposure: too many tots feeding on a single letter, instead of on the entire alphabet banquet."
- |
  

- I offer the glorious triple-pronged  E , the delightfully asymmetrical  Q , even the commercially co-opted  X .
- |
  

- "These are the building blocks of words, communication\x97dare I say, of civilization itself."
- |
  

- Do not let your child join the growing hordes of illiterate dullards hastening in the new Dark Ages.
- |
  

- The highchair tray is nothing less than the battlefield for the final conflict between ignorance and enlightenment.
- |
  

- Take up your sword against the tyranny of the  O .
- Special K
- I see how it is.
- |
  

- You like me, but you don't want me around your baby.
- |
  

- Sure, if you want to take a break from that safe domestic nest and fantasize about slimming down and looking hot, you're all, "Hey, K, let's hang out.
- "\" We used to spend two meals a day together before you got married."
- |
  

- Now, somehow, that's become "
- |
  

- "\" behavior that you don't want to \""
- |
  

- "\" for your kid."
- |
  

- I totally supported you in getting down to 97 pounds for your wedding, and now I guess I'm not enough of a nurturer!
- |
  

- Give me a chance.
- |
  

- It's lonely in this cupboard.
- |
  

- I'm not stale yet.
- |
  

- I have a lot to give.
- |
  

- OK, leave me out.
- |
  

- "But let me tell you something: no matter how much you secretly hang out with me, those stretch marks are not going away."
- Count Chocula
- Oh, honey, it's just that  O s are so JCPenney.
- |
  

- There's no flair, no style, no .
- |
  

- They're beige, for God's sake.
- |
  

- The color of the moment is chocolate brown, like me.
- |
  

- I just had my entire castle repainted in a custom-made paint shade that exactly matches my complexion.
- |
  

- It's chic and serene.
- |
  

- "And\x97hush, hush\x97they mixed it at Home Depot."
- |
  

- But all my friends think it's Jonathan Adler.
- |
  

- He doesn't even have a paint line, but give him time.
- |
  

- Oh, wait.
- |
  

- I get it.
- |
  

- You're afraid your baby is going to turn into a "vampire" if you give him even a hint of style. Puh-lease. It doesn't work that way, puff-phobe.
- Lucky Charms
- Top of the morning!
- |
  

- Is it morning already?
- |
  

- I've been out all night searching the sky for shooting stars.
- |
  

- Oh, sorry.
- |
  

- This is Maggie and Claire.
- |
  

- We met at the pub last night.
- |
  

- Talk about a wish come true!
- |
  

- The bean counter at the end of the bar who grew up eating rows of  O s went home alone.
- |
  

- Why?
- |
  

- Never learned to spot a four-leaf clover, never learned to trust his luck, never gets lucky!
- |
  

- If you want grandchildren, let your wee tyke get his hands on shamrocks and rainbows sooner than later.
- |
  

- If I had my way, rabbits' feet would be in the mix, too, but General Mills says it would scare the kiddies.
- |
  

- Maggie's got a job interview later, so we're heading to the track to see if any of the ponies threw a shoe she can take along.
- |
  

- Spare a splash of Jameson?
- Bulk-Bin Granola
- "In an era where greed is out of control, you are training your child to want more and more  O s. As in zeros\x97at the end of his paycheck."
- |
  

- Let's just rename the cereal Zeerios.
- |
  

- Or Greedios.
- |
  

- Or CEO-eeios.
- |
  

- Hey, Mommy's little Ken Lay.
- |
  

- "One million isn't enough\x97add a zero."
- |
  

- Or two.
- |
  

- Make it a hundred million.
- |
  

- With me he can learn that happiness is derived from simple things, like seeing a raisin coexist peacefully with a coconut flake.
- |
  

- Joy comes from sharing, and sticking together.
- |
  

- "Sometimes we literally stick together, in large clumps\x97just like people do when they commute to work in subway cars and vanpools."
- |
  

- Better teach him about that now.
- |
  

- Because those CEO jobs with personal drivers are hard to come by.
