- You're going to love riding.
- |
  

- Because when I was a little girl I loved it, and you don't know anything about it, that's why.
- |
  

- You can't decide you don't want to ride anymore.
- |
  

- I bought you those $500 boots, so you're going to ride until they fall off your feet, you understand?
- |
  

- You must get back on the horse after you fall off, even if we have to strap your dead body into the saddle.
- |
  

- When INS comes around, don't tell them Eduardo's hiding in a stall.
- |
  

- Yes, you should lie, or do you want to shovel shit yourself?
- |
  

- "I never called him a \"wetback\"\x97at least not to his face\x97so don't say I did."
- Intermediate Training
- |
  

- I'm not giving anything to your horse; it's just a vitamin shot, don't be so paranoid.
- |
  

- Look, he won't get hurt when Twigs throws the fence pole at his legs; he'll just stop being lazy and pick up his feet more over the taller fences.
- |
  

- No, that didn't hurt him .
- |
  

- Just keep walking him, he'll walk it off.
- |
  

- "You are so paranoid\x97this shot is just going to make his leg feel better ."
- |
  

- He can't feel this, it's just a pinprick .
- |
  

- Well, maybe it tickles a little .
- |
  

- Stay still, you goddamn fucker!
- |
  

- "Jesus Christ, he's bolting\x97grab him!"
- Advanced Training
- |
  

- Dedicated riders always want to jump higher fences; they aren't cowards (like you).
- |
  

- Look, I got you this horse instead of getting myself a fur coat and a Mercedes-Benz.
- |
  

- So you are going to listen to your trainer and jump that fence, or I am selling the son of a bitch for dog food right now!
- |
  

- If you don't stop being lazy and get your ankles down, you're going to do a Chris Reeve the first time the horse refuses a fence.
- |
  

- And if you think I'm going to take care of you when you're a quadriplegic, think again.

- "That little girl with the gray horse\x97Eileen?"
- |
  

- She couldn't get her heels down in the stirrups, either, and she begged her parents, and they got her this operation where they broke her ankles and reset them.
- |
  

- So now she gets her heels down and she wins all the time.
- |
  

- Cigarette-smoke sigh.
- |
  

- She's just dedicated, I guess.
- |
  

- "You know, if you begged me really hard for an operation like\x97OK, OK!"
- |
  

- God, I can't believe I'm bleeding this much money and you're such a brat about every little suggestion.

- |
  

- Phft.
- |
  

- You know what Eileen's sister Amy does?
- |
  

- She throws anything lower than second place in the garbage can.
- |
  

- Kiddo, if I had been able to afford to buy Eileen's $35,000 horse, instead of old Alpo here, I would have.
- |
  

- "Eileen fell off when she was riding that last course\x97horse didn't even notice for the next three fences."
