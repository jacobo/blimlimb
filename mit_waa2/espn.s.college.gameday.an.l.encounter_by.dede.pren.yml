- "RECE DAVIS: Welcome back to Spirit Week!"
- |
  

- What a night for this young man out of the Midwest.
- |
  

- Hubert, your thoughts on his offensive game plan?
- "HUBERT DAVIS: Well, I thought the inside-out approach worked well."
- |
  

- Patience isn't his best virtue, but he relaxed down the stretch and worked the clock like a champion.
- |
  

- He had crisp passes, and his soft hands worked the ball around well.
- |
  

- He did get into trouble during the later stages when he wasn't communicating enough, but he managed to stave off the rust and put in a real solid effort against a sizeable opponent.
- "DIGGER PHELPS: What I really like about this kid is his tenacious attack on the offensive end."
- |
  

- "It reminds me of my time at Notre Dame\x97always upset-minded!"
- |
  

- He really hits the hole like a man on a mission.
- |
  

- I haven't been really impressed with his recent performances.
- |
  

- He's struggled offensively, and has been shut out from scoring altogether several times in the past couple of months.
- |
  

- He finally seems to be off the  schneid with this latest conquest, although his opponent wasn't of the quality we like to see this close to March.
- |
  

- However, she was big, and guarded the lane like a pack of wild dogs!
- "JAY BILAS: Dede Preno is a crafty veteran not gifted with great length or tremendous size down low."
- |
  

- At times, he becomes frustrated, and his quickness can become a real liability.
- |
  

- He has been reckless in the past and it has gotten him into lots of trouble.
- |
  

- However, it's his effort that really captivates.
- |
  

- He penetrates well, and if he can stay consistent with the upbeat tempo, I believe he'll have a successful March.
