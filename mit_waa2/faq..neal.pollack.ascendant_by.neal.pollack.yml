- "Q: Hello, Neal."
- |
  

- Great to see you again.
- "A: Great to see you, too."
- |
  

- Thanks for having me.
- "Q: Certainly."
- |
  

- Well,  The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature  has returned.
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- In paperback.
- |
  

- And my six-week two-country tour begins tomorrow.
- "Q: I know."
- |
  

- That's cool and all, but the tour just doesn't have that anarchic feel like it did last time.
- |
  

- Does that mean you don't love me anymore?
- "A: Babe, you know I love you more than anything."
- |
  

- Just because I'm not having meet-the-author lunches and am not holding readings in public bathrooms doesn't mean I've changed.
- |
  

- It just means that my new corporate masters have booked me on Morning Zoos around the country and I get to talk to loud men with wacky nicknames who are going to ask me questions about posing naked with a cat.
- |
  

- It's a 7 a.m.
- |
  

- I must make, and I make it for you.
- "Q: Yeah."
- |
  

- Must be hard to be a famous author.
- "A: Harder than you know."
- |
  

- The Pope weeps for me every day.
- "Q: You suck, Pollack."
- "A: I know."
- "Q: So tell me about your paperback."
- |
  

- Is it really longer than the hardback?
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- It includes ten new pieces, some of which have appeared on this website, some of which have not, as well as new footnotes, a family tree, a study guide, and other effluvia.
- "Q: How is it different than the hardback, though?"
- "A: Well, the hardback, while beautiful and impressive, was almost a wholly improvised project."
- |
  

- Dave Eggers and I conceived of it and threw it together very quickly.
- |
  

- If you read it carefully, the central conceit doesn't hold up very well, but that's part of the fun.
- |
  

- The paperback is a little more tailored and chiseled, a little more thematically consistent.
- |
  

- I made a trade-off.
- |
  

- The hardback had a punk do-it-yourself feel, while the paperback doesn't, because, well, HarperCollins doesn't operate in DIY mode.
- |
  

- In many ways, the paperback is a different book, with a different but equally great cover anchored by one of the world's finest paintings.
- |
  

- I think you'll like it.
- |
  

- A must for any true lover of literature, just like the hardback.
- "Q: The new edition of your book contains some material about the War on Terrorism."
- |
  

- Is it true that your publisher attempted to squelch its release because your ideas were deemed too "controversial"?
- "A: No. You're thinking of Michael Moore."
- "Q: So his book wasn't published?"
- "A: No. It was."
- |
  

- According to him, HarperCollins did the "right thing" by publishing his book.
- "Q: Even though it, yet again, has a photograph of him on the cover?"
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- Isn't that insufferable?
- "Q: Yes."
- |
  

- Will you ever publish a book with your photograph on the cover?
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- It is the inevitable fate of all humorists to become lame.
- |
  

- Be glad you were with me when I was still young and we all lived in Paris and we were very happy.
- "Q: So wait a second."
- |
  

- You've got a record, too?
- |
  

- What's the deal with that?
- "A: I somehow managed to persuade Bloodshot Records, my favorite independent record label in Chicago, to release the Anthology as a spoken-word album."
- "Q: With Jon Langford, of the Mekons?"
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- He is my hero, and he produced the album.
- "Q: What does it sound like?"
- "A: According to Greil Marcus, \"unbearable,\" but what does he know? Langford and other musicians laid down tracks that parody Harry Smith's legendary and beloved  Anthology of American Folk Music , making it sound as though my album had somehow been recorded in the 1930s. I am very proud of the album, and Bloodshot has treated me with all the respect that someone with no musical talent deserves."
- "Q: But that's not all."
- |
  

- There's more.
- "A: Correct."
- |
  

- HarperCollins is also releasing the record as part of a three-CD spoken-word "boxed set" that includes another disk of new pieces from the  Anthology  plus a twenty-five-minute interview with me conducted by John Hodgman that is dark and mysteriously hilarious. Then there is the hour of poetry record live in Brooklyn, on the third CD.
- "Q: And that will be released separately from the Bloodshot album?"
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- Bloodshot will only sell the single CD, and Harper will only sell the three CD set.
- "Q: Who is going to buy these albums?"
- "A: You will."
- "Q: Speaking of poetry, what's up with Poetry and Other Poems?"
- "A: It has been written and is in production, but is not going to be ready by the time my tour starts."
- |
  

- But there will be a poetry book, I promise, from McSweeney's, possibly on a new imprint.
- "Q: Is it true that  www."
- |
  

- "A: Yes, thanks to the hard work of Alexander Budnitz, my new webmaster."
- |
  

- Even if you are still among the employed, I know you don't have much to do these days, now that Suck is gone, Plastic is diminished and Salon charges, so you should visit the site.
- |
  

- See the clip from Dawson's Creek.
- |
  

- Look at photos of my dog.
- |
  

- Luxuriate in a warm bath of self-aggrandizement.
- "Q: And is it also true that you are holding a fan fiction contest?"
- "A: Yes."
- |
  

- You can find details on the "WRITE" section of my website, but if you don't feel like going there, let me just say that I am now accepting fan fiction, which you can send to this email  address . I have already received two excellent fan fictions, one a James-Bond-themed thingy set in Switzerland, and one a dirty little piece about having sex with a monkey, to go with the dozen or so stories I received during the original publication of my book. Please send me fan fiction in any style. It will allow me to be close to you.
- "Q: Is it true you are instructing your subordinates to conduct a \"black\" public relations campaign that involves issuing false press releases and sending false emails to reporters in order to further the aims of your career?"
- "A: I have no knowledge that would indicate what you just said is true."
- "Q: Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?"
- "A: Not unless you want to hear my opinions about the Axis of Evil."
- "Q: No. You probably rip them off The Daily Show like everyone else I know."
- "A: True enough."
- "Q: Do you like my hat?"
- "A: No, I do not like your hat."
- "Q: Goodbye, then."
- "A: Goodbye."
