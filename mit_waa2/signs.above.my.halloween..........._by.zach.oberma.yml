- "Bon app\xE9tit!"
- |
  

- Here is the candy, per your demands.
- |
  

- Please return Cerberus.
- |
  

- It's been a year and we miss him.
- |
  

- Very funny, making my dog a full-fledged meth addict before sending him home.
- |
  

- I get the irony.
- |
  

- Have as much candy as you can eat.
- |
  

- You'd be amazed at how cheap razorblades are these days.
- |
  

- Here we are again.
- |
  

- You're right; I was bluffing last year with the razorblades.
- |
  

- Take the candy.
- |
  

- I can't stop you.
- |
  

- In fact, I hope you enjoy it, I really do.
- |
  

- Because it will be  the last sweet sensation in your sorry excuse for a life .
- |
  

- You've soiled my doorstep, corrupted my dog, ruined four perfectly good tires, and stolen a central piece of my tableware.
- |
  

- I've spent the last three months watching  Apocalypse Now , and as far as you're concerned I'm Colonel fucking Kurtz.
- |
  

- Can you hear that?
- |
  

- In the trees?
- |
  

- That's me.
- |
  

- Turn around and say hi, but make it good, because they'll be your last fucking words, cocksucker.
- |
  

- Howdy!
- |
  

- I want to say that moving to a new neighborhood can be really scary, but everybody has been so terrific, especially in looking past all the ugly rumors that seem to have followed me here.
- |
  

- You know how these "lawyers" can get ...) Anyway, here's a little treat to say thanks! Happy Halloween! (Please take one.)
