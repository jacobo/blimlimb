- My friends and I keep up the routine when I call them on my cell.

- You know, "Carmen, where in the world are you?

- My privacy is simply too important, plus the Chief is still on my ass and seeking extradition rights.
- Let's see, what clues can I give you .

- I was overheard asking about the exchange rate for the euro, and was searching for cheap flights via EasyJet and RyanAir.

- Come on!
- |
  

- You think I'd make it that easy for you?
- Of course, I miss my family in Southern California, but I knew this was part of the life when I got into it.

- And I have my own family now.

- I'm married to Ricardo, one of my henchmen from V.I.
- L.

- |
  

- We understand each other.

- He's OK with my fleeing in the middle of the night without warning for an undisclosed location on the other side of the globe, and I've come to terms with his leaving the toilet seat up.

- Marriage is compromise.
- I'd like to have kids someday, sure.
- |
  

- But I promised myself years ago that, if and when I do pop a little Carmen Tijuana out of the oven, I'd go clean first.
- |
  

- Also, I'd like to do some more traveling.

- You think I'm joking, but when you're sleeping with one eye open for the next hotshot Super Sleuth on your tail, you can't  really  enjoy, say, the Jardins du Luxembourg or the Louvre.

- Not that I'm in Paris.
- |
  

- Or anywhere in Europe.

- This interview is over.
- Waldo
- Got tired of playing the game, simple as that.

- Where's Waldo now?
- "\" Then that crap I did in Hollywood."

- "I felt like I was hiding my whole life\x97from the fans, from my family, from  myself ."
- The thing was, it was a weird kind of celebrity, because I was also wearing this cloak of anonymity, if that makes sense.

- One minute I'd be milling around, unspotted, in a throng of circus performers and football players at a train station, and the next thing I knew, I'd be fingered and made the center of attention.
