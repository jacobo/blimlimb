- John Laslo is a manager at the Hard Times Restaurant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, home of the seventy-ounce steak challenge.
- |
  

- Read  Part One  of the interview with Laslo.
- |
  

- "Q: Has anyone taken the challenge more than once?"
- "Laslo: The only person I'm aware of who has taken the challenge more than once was a big guy from Pennsylvania who was about thirty years old."
- |
  

- This guy came in one day when I was off and he just tore through the challenge.
- |
  

- When he left, he told my boss that he was coming back the next day to do it again.
- |
  

- So my boss called me at home and said, "This guy's coming in to take the challenge.
- |
  

- Just watch him.
- |
  

- You'll be amazed at how quickly he goes through it.
- "\" So the next day, the guy came in and ordered it."
- |
  

- After about twenty minutes, he was struggling.
- |
  

- Then he stopped.
- |
  

- He didn't get through half of it.
- "Q: What happened?"
- "Laslo: I don't know."
- |
  

- Maybe the first one caused so much wear and tear on him that his body just couldn't take another one so quickly.
- "Q: Well, when you're serving someone, are you rooting for them?"
- "Laslo: I think so."
- |
  

- For the most part.
- |
  

- That'd be fair to say because as we've realized over the six years or so that we've offered the challenge, only a small percentage of people are going to succeed, so it doesn't hurt us.
- |
  

- A lot of it has to do with the individual, too.
- |
  

- You get someone who's loud and obnoxious, and you're not as excited for them.
- |
  

- You get someone who's civil and nice, sure, you root for them.
- |
  

- I try to give people bits of advice.
- |
  

- I tell them about pacing themselves.
- |
  

- We don't want to have something that's totally unattainable.
- "Q: When you're serving someone the steak, do you ever think, \"This guy here has got a chance\"?"
- "Laslo: I'm sure I have."
- |
  

- The staff and I discuss it amongst ourselves.
- |
  

- We'll say, "That guy's got a shot.
- "\" But you really don't know until someone starts eating whether they've got a chance."
- |
  

- I've seen huge guys just crumble.
- "Q: What do you mean by crumble?"
- "Laslo: Just not make it."
- |
  

- I mean, there have been some disturbing incidents.
- |
  

- One guy wound up in the bathroom for an hour after trying the challenge.
- "Q: Was he okay?"
- "Laslo: He was fine."
- |
  

- It was just too much food for him.
- "Q: What was it like when he came out after spending an hour in the bathroom?"
- "Laslo: Well, the only way I knew he'd been in there an hour was I saw him go in and he didn't come out until an hour later."
- |
  

- On his way out, he just kind of wheeled by me, and I just thought, "Whoa, he's been in there a  long  time.
- "\" He just scooted out of the door."
- |
  

- No comment, all the way around.
- "Q: What did he look like?"
- "Laslo: He was one of the little guys who tried the challenge, kind of average height, average weight, with glasses."
- |
  

- Clearly, he'd just tried his hardest and got himself into some distress.
- "Q: Is that the most extreme response anyone has had to the challenge?"
- "Laslo: Yes, by lots."
- |
  

- I can't remember anyone else responding like that.
- "Q: When most people have to stop eating, how do they take it?"
- "Laslo: Most people are pretty good-natured about it."
- |
  

- They get into the spirit of the challenge &#151; you against a steak.
- |
  

- Sometimes they're disappointed or surprised because they thought they could do it.
- |
  

- And for some guys, it's a matter of ego.
- |
  

- Some guys, they're bound and determined to finish the whole thing.
- |
  

- They'll hear about the challenge on one trip and return to Niagara Falls just to take the challenge, and they get frustrated when they don't finish it.
- |
  

- But it's mostly good-spirited.
- "Q: What about family or friends?"
- |
  

- How do they react when someone is taking the challenge?
- "Laslo: They're usually more vocal than the eater."
- |
  

- I remember this one family.
- |
  

- A mother ordered the challenge for her son.
- |
  

- He was a big kid, about thirteen-years-old.
- "Q: How big?"
- "Laslo: He was about my height, but he weighed a good two-hundred-plus pounds."
- |
  

- And he tried his best to finish the steak, and his mother was helping him out.
- |
  

- Every now and then, she'd lean over and pinch some food from his plate, like we weren't looking.
- "Q: Did he, or they, finish?"
- "Laslo: No, but it's probably for the best."
- |
  

- You probably shouldn't encourage your thirteen-year-old son to eat a seventy-ounce steak anyway.
- "Q: Well, what's the lure of the seventy-ounce steak challenge?"
- "Laslo: In most cases, I'd say testosterone."
- |
  

- It's the male ego,  Yeah, I could knock that off, no problem .
- |
  

- Lots of times, the challenge is an event.
- |
  

- People will have a party of six or eight together and they're going to watch one or two of their amigos have a go.
- |
  

- It's an entertainment thing all in itself.
- "Q: What's it like in the restaurant when someone orders the steak?"
- "Laslo: There's a discernible hum across the dining room."
- |
  

- People will stop eating and pass the news along, sort of like, "He's doing it!
- |
  

- He's taking the challenge!
- "Q: It's March right now &#151; when was the last time someone took the challenge?"
- "Laslo: It's been a while, actually."
- |
  

- Not since October, November.
- |
  

- Wait, it was earlier than that.
- |
  

- You know, I can't imagine there's any correlation between the two events, but I don't think anyone has actually taken the challenge since everything happened in New York on September eleventh.
- |
  

- That's pretty bizarre.
- "Q: That is."
- "Laslo: Yes."
- "Q: How do I follow that?"
- "Laslo: You've got me."
- "Q: There are many stories about people who have constructed barrels then attempted to survive a ride over the Falls."
- |
  

- In some ways, those people consider the Falls to be a challenge.
- "Laslo: That's true."
- "Q: Do you think the Falls have a similar effect on people who come to your restaurant?"
- |
  

- Are people more willing to take the seventy-ounce steak challenge because they've seen the Falls and are inspired to greatness, or at least incredible physical feats?
- "Laslo: I don't think the Falls specifically do that, but coming to the city of Niagara Falls and everything that means &#151; not just the water over the rock &#151; has an impact."
- "Q: Can you explain that?"
- "Laslo: I don't mean this to sound critical &#151; don't get me wrong &#151; but the city of Niagara Falls is almost a low-rent, carnival-like kind of place, with the wax museums and the lights and the haunted houses."
- |
  

- It's a la-la land.
- |
  

- It's not "real" like your hometown in, say, northern Pennsylvania is "real.
- "\" Niagara's a getaway place, an oasis away from reality."
- |
  

- It's easy to get here because it's so close to a lot of East Coast cities.
- |
  

- And when you're here in Niagara Falls, you can blow off for a couple of days.
- |
  

- And it's not really a high-class place, where you feel like you have to dress up or you have to be on your best behavior or anything like that.
- |
  

- It's just a relaxed, easy, simple place to go.
- |
  

- In that kind of place, people do things they wouldn't normally do.
- |
  

- I think that's it.
- |
  

- I hope I didn't blow a theme for you there.
- "Q: No, that's fine."
- "Laslo: I see where you were going with the challenges."
- |
  

- I didn't mean to shoot it down, but this is just a crazy little place where people do crazy things.
