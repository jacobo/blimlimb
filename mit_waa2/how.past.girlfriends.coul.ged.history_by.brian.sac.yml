- Adolf Hitler
- Tammy wouldn't like Hitler's sense of humor and would give him a frowny face every time he told a joke.
- |
  

- He would invite her to his parades and she'd tell him the goose-stepping looked "gay" and that she "didn't get" the swastika.
- |
  

- This would undermine his confidence and make it harder for him to retain an iron grip on power.

- "\"I don't know what you see in that Goebbels,\""
- |
  

- "\"He seems like kind of a loser."
- "\" Her constant criticisms would result in Hitler and Goebbels not hanging out as much."
- |
  

- As a result, Nazi propaganda would suffer.
- |
  

- Tammy would also insist that they forgo his favorite watering holes and instead go to places she likes.
- |
  

- The putsch would then happen at a tacky folk-music bar with her ex-boyfriend playing guitar.
- |
  

- Most of Hitler's friends wouldn't have shown up, because they couldn't stand the constant arguing.
- |
  

- In the middle of their relationship, Tammy would tell Hitler she was going on a trip with some guy she worked with.
- |
  

- With Hitler's self-esteem in the gutter, he'd lack the support and influence necessary to invade Poland and start World War II.
- |
  

- Eventually, he'd break up with Tammy and call Himmler, whom he'd blown off for two years.
- The Titanic
- Sharon would go into the captain's quarters and refuse to leave.

- |
  

- "\"I just want to talk."
- "\" He'd beg her to leave, but she would just keep telling the captain she loved him and wanted to talk."

- "\"I don't want to talk,\""
- |
  

- "\"I don't want anything to do with you."
- "\" Sharon would tell him that's not true and that she knew he loved her."
- |
  

- She'd say she wouldn't let him break up with her anyway.
- |
  

- The captain would threaten to call the police.
- |
  

- "\"Go ahead,\""
- |
  

- "\"I'm not leaving."
- "\" Frustrated and desperate to get away from her, he'd flee his quarters and run on deck, where he'd spot the giant iceberg."
- |
  

- "\"Goodness!"
- |
  

- Go a few degrees port-ish,"
- |
  

- Sharon would be unaware that she saved so many lives, as she would be busy trying to feed the captain's cat a tomato&#8212;because she thinks cats can eat them.
- |
  

- After finally exiting the captain's quarters for good, she'd leave a long message on his voice mail telling him he was an ugly loser and everyone hated him.
- |
  

- Then she'd make out with his first mate.
- September 11
- In the middle of planning a surprise attack on civilians, Osama bin Laden would be invited to meet Anna's family in rural Pennsylvania over Christmas break.
- |
  

- Osama would get along fine with the overbearing mom and timid dad until the mom went through his bags and found Anna's marijuana and birth control pills.
- |
  

- Having triggered the mother's dormant psychosis, Anna would then be dragged upstairs for six hours of being called a whore.
- |
  

- This would be discomforting to Osama, who would sit in the living room freaking out.
- |
  

- When Mohammed Atta called to check in, Osama would be totally frazzled.
- |
  

- "\"Hold off on the martyrdom ops, dude."
- |
  

- I'm up to my ears in shit,"
- |
  

- Anna and Osama would decide to cut the trip short and leave the next day.
- |
  

- The following morning, Osama would sit in the freezing car for another three hours while the mom wrapped up calling her daughter a whore and drug addict.
- |
  

- While her dad remained in the house peering from behind the curtains, Anna's mom would come out to curse at Osama for ruining their daughter's "white wedding.
- "\" Osama would be forced to spend the next year dealing with Anna's being disowned."
- |
  

- While tending to her subsequent nervous breakdown, he'd neglect his evil endeavor, which would give a vigilant INS the chance to notice that several pilots-in-training had no interest in flaps or landing gear.
- Cuban Missile Crisis
- Maggie would regularly call Castro "Mr. Poops," which he'd find endearing but, at the same time, childish. Though she's an extremely beautiful and sweet girl, Castro would have a hard time finding her sexy, because of the childlike demeanor. Every time he said, "So .
- |
  

- "\" she'd finish with \""
- |
  

- "\" Again, something he'd find cute but weird."
- |
  

- Castro would find it very hard to stay threatening on the phone with Kennedy, because she would make puckered-up fish faces as he talked.
- |
  

- She would only communicate with him in babyspeak, which he would accidentally carry over into his conversations with the Soviets.
- |
  

- After hearing Castro say, "
- Toodles, my noodle," Khrushchev would call a little powwow at the Kremlin.
- |
  

- The Politburo would decide that Mr. Poops wasn't the best person to mind their nuclear weapons.
- |
  

- There would be no missile crisis.
- |
  

- A few weeks later, Castro would call the relationship quits when he hears Maggie pee.

- Southern twang.

- "\"C'mon, baby doll."
- "\" He would be very concerned about the FBI/ATF forces amassed outside his compound, but she would only talk about sex."
- |
  

- She'd tell him to try some ecstasy because the sex would be great when on ecstasy.
- |
  

- About 12 minutes later he'd realize he was chemically impotent, but that would be OK with him.
- |
  

- He'd just smile.
- |
  

- "\"What's the matter, baby doll,\""
- |
  

- "\"You gay, baby doll?"
- "\" He'd take deep breaths and sink into the bed as his pupils dilated to maximum."
- |
  

- Having discovered the remarkable texture of Kelly's fake breasts, he'd start rubbing them lovingly and telling her how fantastic they were.
- |
  

- The warmth of her skin would resonate as awesome ATF agents beautifully entered his wonderful bedroom and fired two gorgeous rounds into his eye.
