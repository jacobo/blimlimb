- Honey?

- I'm home.
- Yeah, it is rather a lot of blood, but don't worry about it.
- I fought piranhas.
- Oh, yeah, I did have a meeting.

- I took the new client, Mr. Muldoon, to the zoo.

- It seems he really enjoys taunting the elephants.

- Says it reminds him of his childhood, when he used to mock the big-nosed, big-eared poor people his father kept in cages, which makes sense, I guess.

- The elephants didn't look like they had very much money.
- After watching the elephants for a good three hours, Mr. Muldoon and I took a walk through the aquarium.

- He seemed a bit bored for a while, but when we got to the piranhas he started to smile, and said, "Man oh man!

- I used to know a poor guy who looked just like one of these fishy doodads!

- My friends and I used to beat the fuck out of him!
- "\" At that moment, it struck me that ."

- I'd never fought a fish.
- It may not be such a big deal for you, but having fought a fish is very important for men.
- |
  

- No one can really even call himself a man unless he's eaten two steaks in one meal, made love to a woman after having eaten a steak, and fought a goddamned fish.
- No, I didn't end up doing too well.

- It turns out that piranhas are very difficult to fight.
- |
  

- You go left, they start chewing on your leg.
- |
  

- You go right, they continue chewing on your leg.
- |
  

- I did punch one of them in the face, but it just started chewing on my hand, and then went back to chewing on my leg.
- |
  

- It was pretty painful, but, as a dozen of the buggers swam up my pant leg, I realized I didn't have to fight these fish.
- |
  

- There I was, up to my eyes in water, getting bits I didn't even know I had torn off me, splashing my own blood over tourists and nontourists alike, and it occurred to me that I shouldn't live my life based on silly things like how many fish I've injured or how many steaks I've eaten before or after sex.
- |
  

- "It was odd: even though I was pretty much being eaten alive, I didn't really mind."
- |
  

- I suppose it's the same sort of feeling Jesus had while on the cross, or how Buddha felt when Mechabuddha beat him up in downtown Tokyo.
- Anyway, I've decided to make some serious changes in my life.
- |
  

- I quit my job, and the zoo hired me to fight the piranhas five times a day.
- Is it legal?
- |
  

- That's for the lawyers to decide.
- |
  

- All I know is that I've got an exciting new career, and a week off to get some prosthetic ears.
- Oh, that reminds me.
- |
  

- The piranhas ate my ears.

  I fought piranhas.
  Oh, yeah, I did have a meeting. I took the new client, Mr. Muldoon, to the zoo. It seems he really enjoys taunting the elephants.

  After watching the elephants for a good three hours, Mr. Muldoon and I took a walk through the aquarium. He seemed a bit bored for a while, but when we got to the piranhas he started to smile, and said, "Man oh man! I used to know a poor guy who looked just like one of these fishy doodads! My friends and I used to beat the fuck out of him!" At that moment, it struck me that ... that ... well, that I'd never fought a fish.
  It may not be such a big deal for you, but having fought a fish is very important for men. No one can really even call himself a man unless he's eaten two steaks in one meal, made love to a woman after having eaten a steak, and fought a goddamned fish.
