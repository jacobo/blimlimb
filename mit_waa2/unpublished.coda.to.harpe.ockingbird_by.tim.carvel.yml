  Atticus shot the monkey when it refused to dance. Technically, it had not so
  much refused to dance as refused to continue dancing &#8212; it had been doing the
  soft-shoe for four hours, and it was getting tired. It only needed a few
  minutes to rest. But Atticus was having one of his moods.
  Atticus had long maintained that it was a sin to kill any animal whose sole purpose was to provide delight &#8212; his favorite example being the mockingbird. The rest, of course, were fair game. In the six months since he had retired from the practice of law and taken the job of zookeeper, Atticus was putting that principle into action. He had killed eight pheasants, a giraffe, two
  chimpanzees, six porcupines, all the reptiles, and more blue jays than you
  could shake a stick at. The smarter of the animals had begun to make
  themselves useful: the hippos had taken up scrimshaw; the ducks were
  practicing their madrigals; and the remaining three giraffes busied
  themselves with digging graves for what Atticus liked to call "my
  disappointments." Nobody wanted to replicate the pandas' mistake. They had a
  good run for a while with their comical tumbling, but didn't realize that
  Atticus had grown tired of their routine until it was too late &#8212; far, far too
  late.
  Now, in a desperate effort to keep Atticus amused, the animals worked on
  expanding their repertoires. The prairie dogs had a new precision-dance
  routine every Saturday night, and the rumor was that they were beginning to
  look into some sort of synchronized-swimming thing, but the seals and sea
  lions were unwilling to help. The polar bears and grizzly bears had their
  soccer matches, and the penguins &#8212; well, the penguins were just so fucking
