  Who is Caesar Rodney? Who is this man I find on my newly minted quarter?
  He is from, or in some way related to, Delaware. This is all I know. It
  was a large, elfin man who first posed this question to me. This man was
  carrying a sousaphone. I could offer no satisfactory answer.
  In his book about alchemy, "Alchemy," Titus Burckhardt wrote, "Gold and
  silver were already sacred metals, even before they became the measure
  of all commercial transactions. They are earthly reflections of sun and
  moon&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For men of pre-rationalistic times the relationship between the
  noble metals and the two great luminaries was obvious, and a whole world
  of mechanistic notions and prejudices was necessary to obscure the
  self-evident reality of this relationship and make it look like a mere
  aesthetic accident."
  My question is this: Are mechanistic notions and prejudices to blame? Or
  was it Caesar Rodney? Was he a boxer? Those are three questions.
  In my wallet is a torn 1,000-lira note, a souvenir from travels in
  Italy. I also keep in my possession a digital Godzilla watch from the
  same trip. The watch, not Godzilla, is digital. The Great Lizard goes by
  the name Il Mostro in Italy. On the Italian bill is a picture of M.
  Montessori b/w a teacher looking lovingly upon her student. Perhaps her
  student is learning about Caesar Rodney. This is unlikely.
  In an article questioning the current worth of gold in Newsweek's 
  July&nbsp;19 issue, writer Jeffrey Bartholet informs us that "No country uses the
  gold standard anymore. So, in some eyes, those giant hoards [of gold]
  are on par with Aunt Sadie stashing her savings under a mattress."
  Presumably the house of Bartholet's Aunt Sadie is a good one from which
  to steal.
  I have sat through many history classes. I have learned many things
  about
  America. I do not know who Caesar Rodney was. It is a great land,
  America. Rendered as he is, strikingly, on the new Delaware quarter,
  Caesar Rodney appears to be a great man. Surely he was. By Godzilla's
  side, however, he would have been a better man. One I would have known.
