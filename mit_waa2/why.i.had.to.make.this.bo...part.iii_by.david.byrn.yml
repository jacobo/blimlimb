- "PART III: An Ominous Lack Of Information"
- During this time Danielle and I repeatedly requested more information from Valencia.
- |
  

- What was their budget for this?
- |
  

- Who was their shipper and how long would it take to get there?
- |
  

- Had they contacted hotels about placing books in the drawers during the Biennial?
- There were no answers to any of the above.
- |
  

- We sent more messages in desperate tones, but were told the decision-makers were not in at the moment.
- |
  

- It was sort of maddening.
- Despite this ominous lack of information, I decided to continue to work on the book.
- |
  

- It was starting to take shape.
- |
  

- It also began to get longer.
- |
  

- So I edited the text severely, then I asked friends and family to suggest cuts as well, as a longer book would drive it way over the budget estimate we had just sent to Valencia (failing receipt of a budget from them we decided we would just tell them how much it would cost).
- |
  

- Kara and Adelle, my wife, both made valuable suggestions of places to cut, so I edited it down once more.
- I cut the text down to a length that would only raise the budget slightly.
- |
  

- Then the M.R.
- |
  

- Oh shit.
- |
  

- They looked beautiful.
- |
  

- Perfect.
- |
  

- But the lovely little frames he added around the pages and other design elements made the book even longer.
- |
  

- And of course he had nice suggestions, such as including a foldout page and a dedication page, both of which further added to the length.
- I was worried about the cost of the book, given that Valencia had hinted at a fairly frugal overall budget for my project.
- |
  

- I had also thought that this book would be printed in Spain, assuming that this would save money for the Biennial.
- Luckily, McSweeney's was now publishing books!
- |
  

- We talked at this point about distributing the book in the United States, in addition to the motel rooms of greater Valencia.
- |
  

- It seemed to be a good fit, this book and McSweeney's, and we decided to print a bunch of copies for readers in America.
- And at this point, having heard only silence from Valencia regarding printing the book, I was informed Oddi, the Icelandic printer of McSweeney's, also printed Bibles, and thus would know all the techniques.
- |
  

- "So it was agreed: the New Sins, an updated version of elements of the New Testament, to be published in a half-English, half-Spanish edition, would be printed in Iceland."
- Better yet, I had given an early sample of pages to Walter Donohue at Faber and Faber, in London Towne, while we both went to see an exhibit of Botticelli drawings for Dante's inferno.
- |
  

- I was obviously still doing research*.
- |
  

- Now Faber and Faber, publishers of T.S.
- |
  

- Eliot, and McSweeney's, publishers of, well, some writers whose work hasn't yet been the source of popular Broadway musicals, were joined in disseminating this important work.
- We continued to email and call Valencia, in hopes of receiving some information regarding placement in hotel rooms.
- |
  

- We were told to speak to a woman named Sally Jo, who was English, but with what seemed like a Texas name.
- |
  

- She told us she was in charge of the placement of the books in hotels.
- |
  

- Now we were getting somewhere.
- |
  

- I figured, what with the Biennial run by both Spaniards and Italians, they decided they needed some good Anglo-Saxon organizational skills to pull things together, hotel-wise.
- But somehow, that elusive information we sought from Valencia was always just one step, one meeting, away.
- |
  

- The book was already at the publisher in Reykjavik and Danielle was there supervising the color corrections with the printer.
- |
  

- I advised her to check out Sigur Ros and meet up with Einar, ex-Sugarcube and head of Bad Taste records.
- |
  

- Reykjavik, and Iceland in general, is a fun and extraordinary place, and Danielle can tell you all about it if you ask her.
- |
  

- Not all of which was I able to use.
- |
  

- I discovered, for instance, that the Devil, Saint Lucifer, resides in the exact center of the Earth, sort of stuck, half frozen, in ice!
- |
  

- Not fire) and that he has 3 heads&nbsp;&#151; a mockery of the Holy Trinity, so we were informed.
- |
  

- As Dante and Virgil came upon this huge (at least 4 stories tall he is) beast, they fear not&nbsp;&#151; they leap right onto him, grasping his fur (!) The 2 explorers then clamber down his hairy bod, until they reach the waist of the beast.

- Earth.
- |
  

- At that point, having gone down as far as down goes, they sort of squirm and shimmy around and seem to stand on their heads.

  PART III: An Ominous Lack Of Information

At that point, having gone down as far as down goes, they sort of squirm and shimmy around and seem to stand on their heads...as they descend past the devil's waist they are, of course, actually going up!
