- A DISPATCH BY CHERYL WAGNER

- WARM SPRINGS, GEORGIA&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;I went to put my feet in the tiny puddle of Warm Springs, see what was left of FDR's Honeycomb Hideout there.
- |
  

- They said they had to drain the pools because someone had sucked out the minerals from beneath the concrete.
- |
  

- They said they were diverting what was left of the healing waters to a private hospital, that FDR's polio Lourdes hadn't worked anyway, had near about caved in.
- I walked down the old gurney ramp into the empty chamber.
- |
  

- The pool walls reflected sun and what wasn't there.
- |
  

- It was the tunnel from when you die and come back, blinding hot and bright white.
- |
  

- Ghosts of rigid kids bobbed and splashed in the air around me.
- |
  

- A small bubbling fountain slicked the only wet spot.
- |
  

- I took my sandals off and slipped my toes in.
- |
  

- I expected healing hot springs, not tepid trickle.
- |
  

- No wonder debate still raged about what really happened there.
- These are the facts.
- |
  

- An abandoned metal gurney pushed behind a row of swimsuit changing rooms.
- |
  

- Middle-class mothers walking door to door collecting shiny dimes.
- |
  

- Crippled water basketball kids slam-dunking their way back to life.
- |
  

- Heavy Georgia heat.
- |
  

- Poolside war dispatches and grim-suited cabinet members sleeping in wooden cabins.
- |
  

- A photograph of a stricken President nicknamed Rosie smiling and swimming and crutchless and free.
- In the Little White House, dozens of canes hung on the wall.
- |
  

- People had carved them for their favorite President with their own pocketknives.
- |
  

- Some had smiling bear heads.
- |
  

- People didn't know their President would crumble like matchsticks if he leaned on them.
- |
  

- It was "a splendid deception," some dim scribe scribed, that FDR's fancy convertible was hand-controlled. That the only thing between the four-term Harvard President and a sidewalk belly flop was a secret wheelchair shrouded in dark blanket. FDR wanted people to love and elect him. Knew they wouldn't if they remembered legs rot.
- I saw FDR's shame.
- |
  

- An elevated box-top toilet and bathtub handrails.
- |
  

- I stared.
- |
  

- The country's first Americans with Disabilities Act was as secret as what Oppenheimer was up to.
- |
  

- But someone outed FDR the day he died, leaked how crippled he was.
- |
  

- Maybe to freeze him shrunken and withered once and for all, but maybe the just-as-bad opposite.
- |
  

- Maybe to enshrine him, to prove that useless legs made him a saint.
- |
  

- Staffers preserved the last roll of toilet paper he ever used.
- |
  

- I saw its tissue browned in a glass box on the wall, ridiculous and eerie&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;lonely testament to the failed Presidential body.
- In the iron lung museum at Warm Springs, I met a woman who at four-years-old had attended FDR's broken kid Thanksgiving feast.
- |
  

- She worked for the State Park Service and was a secret living exhibit there.
- |
  

- At four, she had been club-footed and scared.
- |
  

- When her parents dressed her up for the holiday, she thought she might be on the President's menu&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;that he might be one of the doctors who poured paraffin-like gravy to warm her bone china in a mold.
- |
  

- And no wonder.
- |
  

- Who knew who it was who said this won't hurt much!
- |
  

- "\"No. Not at that time."
- |
  

- I don't recall many retarded kids there,"
- |
  

- "\"Maybe some Cerebral Palsy."
- |
  

- But then maybe only the ones who could talk or were Polio-connected.
- |
  

- They were strapped.
- |
  

- Needed all they had for the normal ones.
- They don't work right now&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;her ankles.
- |
  

- She lifted her pants leg to show me her black orthopod burden and tough leg braces because I would look.
- |
  

- She admitted that she tries to go without the clumsy pods, that the turkey was good that day, that without the hard shoes, standing alone, her ankles break.
