- Jonson Miller, a graduate student at Virginia Tech university and committed peace activist, spent fifty-seven days at the Beckley Federal Correctional Institute in West Virginia this summer for a trespassing conviction he received after protesting the continuing operation of The Western Hemispheric Institute for Security Cooperation [WHISC].
- |
  

- WHISC, formerly known as the School of the Americas [SOA], operates as a sort of military training ground for South Americans looking for United States aid in ridding their countries of rebels and anti-government groups.
- |
  

- The interview took place over several sessions, including through regular old mail while he was still "down.
- "\"*   *Down = when you're doing time, it's called being down."
- |
  

- Read  part one .
- |
  

- "Q: So, can I ask the question we all wonder about?"
- |
  

- About personal hygiene practices and the dangers therein?
- "Miller: Most people are very clean here."
- |
  

- The only danger is if you shower without shower shoes.
- |
  

- You'll get unbelievable foot fungi and other such things.
- "Q: Oh hell, I was trying to avoid saying it right out."
- |
  

- The soap and shower ordeal.
- |
  

- If you drop it,  can  you pick it up?
- |
  

- Are there repercussions?
- |
  

- How's the "he's my bitch" social dimension in a prison of activists and drug dealers?
- "Miller: Yes, you can pick it up!"
- |
  

- I haven't heard of any rape here.
- |
  

- However, there is much consensual sex.
- |
  

- We have showers with stalls here.
- |
  

- From what I hear, rape isn't nearly as prevalent in even the high security penitentiaries as people believe.
- |
  

- But I haven't been there.
- "Q: Okay, thanks for letting me ask that."
- |
  

- Shifting back now, we were talking about reading or lack thereof, in the hole.
- |
  

- Out of the hole, what did you read?
- "Miller: I read four books in the  Dune  series."
- |
  

- I got a lot out of those.
- |
  

- Seriously, I really liked them.
- |
  

- I read the autobiography of Nelson Mandela.
- |
  

- And  Why We Can't Wait,  by Martin Luther King, Jr.
- |
  

- Birmingham protests.
- "Q: Do you get to listen to the radio?"
- |
  

- I'm assuming no TV.
- |
  

- No TV right?
- "Miller: We do have TVs, but you have to buy a radio to listen to either the radio or TV."
- |
  

- But I didn't buy one, because I don't want to give them the money.
- "Q: Did others watch it a lot?"
- |
  

- Like, is there a big room where they all hang out and watch  The Practice  or Court TV?
- "Miller: There was definitely much TV viewing."
- |
  

- There were three small TV rooms in our housing unit.
- |
  

- Either CNN or Fox News was pretty much always on.
- |
  

- There was always a TV preacher on in the morning before "work call.
- "\" Soap operas in the afternoon."
- |
  

- These are actually great for people in prison, because they have very long and continuous stories that you have to keep up with.
- |
  

- I imagine it really helps to pass the time.
- |
  

- There are also movies each weekend.
- |
  

- Sports were another big draw.
- |
  

- And just like soap operas, they really help to pass the time.
- "Q: You're better off without it."
- |
  

- A few weeks ago I was grading tests while watching television, and I ended up watching about 2/3 of a really bad made-for-TV movie about Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys.
- |
  

- I couldn't tell if it was a dull and tired story because that's how all bands were, or if it was because this was a made-for-TV movie, you know?
- "Miller: No, but my heart aches for your suffering."
- |
  

- Poor me, I'm only in prison.
- "Q: We sort of touched on this, but then glided past, so let me go here again."
- |
  

- What's the political atmosphere there?
- |
  

- Different views?
- "Miller: As I said, few people have love for the government, but most people seem fairly conservative."
- |
  

- There are many libertarians.
- |
  

- I get along better with them than I do conservatives.
- |
  

- There are also a few Black Nationalists.
- |
  

- They're cool too.
- "Q: What are they like?"
- |
  

- Like in the movies?
- |
  

- Loud and angry?
- |
  

- I didn't know they were still around.
- "Miller: The Nation of Islam and other groups are still around."
- |
  

- One of my best friends here is in the Nation of Islam.
- |
  

- He doesn't care that I'm white.
- |
  

- And we're both angry at the government and racism.
- |
  

- But he is very pleasant and full of laughter.
- "Q: Tell me this: how do all these people get to the camp in the first place?"
- "Miller: As opposed to the higher security places?"
- |
  

- Basically, you either get convicted of some misdemeanor or a non-violent crime (like me) and they send you here.
- |
  

- Or you work your way down.
- |
  

- This place, the work camp, is a satellite area separate from the main correctional facility, which is known as "behind the fence.
- "Q: Do they keep close tabs on you?"
- |
  

- Are the guards bastards?
- "Miller: You mean Cops."
- |
  

- You have to see, well, it's like this.
- |
  

- First off, they are Federal employees.
- |
  

- Keep that in mind.
- |
  

- And besides that, they are prison employees.
- |
  

- So, it's the laziest of the lazy.
- |
  

- You know, they have snitches inside.
- |
  

- These guys, these snitches, think they're scoring points with the Cops, but the Cops hate them.
- |
  

- It's just more work for them.
- |
  

- Cops = anyone on prison staff and any inmate collaborator.
- "Q: What do they snitch about?"
- "Miller: Things like having contraband."
- |
  

- Or sneaking to the woods to get stuff smuggled in.
- |
  

- Stuff like that.
- "Q: How do you go to the woods and get things smuggled?"
- |
  

- You can just walk out?
- "Miller: I don't know."
- |
  

- I didn't see anything.
- |
  

- I didn't hear anything.
- |
  

- I don't know anything.
- "Q: Don't they keep track of the prisoners at all?"
- "Miller: They have different ways, yeah."
- |
  

- There's Count Time,* when they make you go to your cell or cubicle.
- |
  

- There's Recall** too.
- |
  

- That's when you have to just go back to your housing unit.
- |
  

- It's a lower level Count Time.
- |
  

- Count Time = happens at four and at nine.
- |
  

- At four you have to stand outside and be counted.
- |
  

- At nine you can be in your bed or someplace similar, and be counted there, so long as everyone is in their place.
- |
  

- Recall = When you have to go back to your housing unit.
- |
  

- So, for Jonson, if he was out playing the banjo with his band of Fundamentalists and Black Nationalists, they'd have to all get back to their cells.
- "Q: What happens if someone's gone?"
- "Miller: It depends which kind of count we're talking about."
- |
  

- It's funny.
- |
  

- They have Census* too.
- |
  

- The thing with Census is that the Cops go around and count people.
- |
  

- But they only have to be within ten of the correct number.
- |
  

- Census = when the Cops go around and count all the people they can find.
- |
  

- Different than Recall, since the prisoners aren't called in, and Count Time (same reason).
- "Q: You're serious?"
- |
  

- That's wild.
- |
  

- Do you think that's like a negotiated number in the Cops' contract?
- |
  

- Maybe they used to have to be within six, but during the last contract talks they bartered up to ten?
- "Miller: They are federal employees."
- "Q: How many people are we talking, in the prison?"
- |
  

- And how long are these guys there?
- "Miller: The main area?"
- |
  

- There are 4,000 prisoners total, I think.
- |
  

- But only 400 in the work camp.
- |
  

- The thing is, people can be in the main prison for decades.
- |
  

- In the work camp, I think three years is probably the longest.
- |
  

- There's this one guy, he was a Weatherman from the sixties.
- |
  

- He's been in jail for, I think, twenty-seven years.
- "Q: What did he do?"
- "Miller: He broke into a National Guard armory and stole stuff."
- |
  

- And they tried to blow up some communications towers.
- |
  

- Stuff like that.
- |
  

- But, he's worked down to the camp here.
- |
  

- And now he's on this last six months.
- "Q: Do you workout a lot?"
- |
  

- As far as I know, prison is all about working out and clanging metal cups against bars.
- "Miller: We don't have bars here &#8212; just concrete cubicles &#8212; so there's no clanging."
- |
  

- But there is lots of working out.
- |
  

- Not that I do any of it.
- "Q: You know what I wonder about?"
- |
  

- Do people barter a lot?
- |
  

- I can picture guys lifting weights and hanging out in an open space, but making deals on the side.
- |
  

- Like working out is a front.
- |
  

- What's the economy like in there?
- "Miller: I don't know about it being a front, but as for bartering, the black market currency is cans of mackerel."
- |
  

- They cost about $1 in the commissary &#8212; like a giant silver dollar.
- |
  

- You can pay someone some cans to buff the floor of your cell or do your laundry.
- "Q: Is it worth it?"
- |
  

- I can't picture buffed floors being a priority.
- |
  

- Laundry, maybe.
- |
  

- But floors?
- "Miller: Actually, having a buffed floor is required."
- |
  

- The Cops can harass you if your cell isn't clean.
- |
  

- They don't usually do anything, but one time a Cop cut off the TVs because he thought our housing unit wasn't clean enough.
- |
  

- But prisoners do barter for other things.
- "Q: Such as?"
- "Miller: Food, ingredients."
- |
  

- Some people did some cooking with food bought from the commissary and the microwave in our housing unit.
- |
  

- It's like Taco Bell.
- |
  

- "You only have four ingredients: refried beans, rice, summer sausage, and Goya seasoning."
- |
  

- But, somehow, folks managed to come up with a dozen different recipes.
- "Q: So maybe they were watching the Food Network."
- "Miller: We don't have that many channels &#8212; at least I don't think we do."
- |
  

- Hell, I don't actually know; I never watch it.
- |
  

- You have to understand, though, that bartering is basically necessary.
- |
  

- We're not provided with our basic necessities.
- |
  

- It's small stuff, but, for example, you have to buy your own nail clippers from the commissary.
- |
  

- You have to have them, but they won't give them to you.
- |
  

- Phone calls cost $3 for fifteen minutes.
- |
  

- Stamps are thirty-seven cents each.
- |
  

- How are you supposed to get this stuff if you are making 10 cents/hour working for the prison?
- "Q: What would happen if the prisoners just didn't do the work?"
- "Miller: The prisoners often don't have anything else, so they take the jobs."
- |
  

- But the cops would flip if we all suddenly refused to buy anything from the commissary or to take their slave jobs.
- |
  

- What would be the point of this place if we refused?
- |
  

- They might as well send us all home at that point.
- "Q: Okay, I'll leave it there for now."
- |
  

- I'll see you soon, huh?
- "Miller: Yeah, thanks for the questions."
- |
  

- See you on the outside.
