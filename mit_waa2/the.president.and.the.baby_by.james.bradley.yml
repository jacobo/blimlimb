  The President and the baby were born on the same day, but under different
  signs. When you ask them how this can be, the President launches into a
  lengthy explanation with references to Copernican theory and congressional
  gridlock and the baby merely stares at you and spits up on its chin. Both
  are merely speculating. They are mystified and confused, but don't want to
  say so.
  The President and the baby decide to work together to eliminate world
  hunger. They hold conferences for several weeks in major U.S. cities,
  inviting mayors, governors, pop singers, and major basketball stars. Many
  ideas are discussed, but most of the participants become discouraged and
  despair of any good coming from the sessions because of the clannish way
  the President and the baby side with each other, ganging up on the others
  and creating an unmistakable us-vs.-them dynamic that undermines the
  group's stated purpose. Eventually they abandon the suggestions of others
  in favor of their own plan, devised by the baby: develop one very large
  breast from which the entire population of the earth can suckle. The
  President moves to make emergency funding available immediately. The baby
  avers that perhaps two breasts will be needed, given the size of the
  world's population. A special executive committee forms, jointly chaired
  by the President and the baby.
  The President and the baby are rarely apart. Theirs is a curious
  relationship. The President's wife and children are alarmed by the
  apparent mutual dependence; the baby's parents and siblings--though at
  first thrilled by the President's interest in their kin--are starting to
  worry that their own bonds are deteriorating. It is just not right for a
  grown man and a baby to spend all their time together. Apart from the way
  it's distracting both from more useful exercises of their time, political
  opponents of both the President and the baby are starting to make nasty
  insinuations that could hurt them both in the end.
  When these very practical considerations are so much as mentioned to them,
  
  the President and the baby take offense. The President begins a protracted
  discourse on McCarthyism and its relation to Dr. Spock's theories of the
  developing psyche in infants aged 0-2 years. The baby cites Kierkegaard's
  theory of subjective truth and his defense of the rational self as being
  forged in relation to (and sometimes in opposition of) external as well as
  internal forces. Their defenses are virtually unassailable and baffling to
  the lay person.
  Despite their closeness, the President and the baby don't really like each
  other. They each suspect that the other is envious. They are both right.
  This causes endless fights, some of them physical. Once, the baby gripped
  the President's right forefinger as tightly as it could and wouldn't let
  go for several seconds. The President, being right-handed, claimed his
  ability to veto legislation and play golf with important men was hampered
  for two weeks. Another time, the President yelled at the baby with such
  severity that it cried for an hour and then contacted certain well-known
  attorneys who brought a civil suit against the President. The suit was
  ultimately settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum of money.
  Despite their animosities, the President and the baby seem inseparably
  connected by forces beyond their control. What will happen when the
  President leaves office? What will happen when the baby grows up? No less
  than the future is at stake. The future of the President, the future of
  the baby, and the future of the world. Political opponents are closing in.
  They are desperately trying to dig up dirt on the baby. The baby is
  rumored to have poor credit and even poorer approval ratings among his
  play group. The President is said to be cheating on his children. The
  President and the baby vow to take on all comers. They keep their upper
  lips stiff. They decide to stand together. If they must they will consult
  with public relations professionals and meet with radio talk show hosts.
  Where necessary they will confer accolades. They will fully assess that
  which needs assessment. No less than the future is at stake. The future of
  the President, the future of the baby, the future of the world.
