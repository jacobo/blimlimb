- Very doubtful.
- |
  

- But you brought that on yourself.
- |
  

- As I see it, yes.
- |
  

- But when was the last time you cared what I thought?
- |
  

- My sources say yes.
- |
  

- And they have no reason to lie about seeing you at the mall in the middle of a school day.
- |
  

- It is decidedly so.
- |
  

- I just know.
- |
  

- Outlook good.
- |
  

- Let's see how long that lasts.
- |
  

- Outlook not so good.
- |
  

- See?
- |
  

- Better not tell you now.
- |
  

- You seem upset and I'm afraid you might do something irrational.
- |
  

- At least that's what  Time  magazine says about teenagers.
- |
  

- Signs point to yes.
- |
  

- The incense, for one.
- |
  

- How stupid do you think I am?
- |
  

- Don't count on it.
- |
  

- Or on much else if you keep going the way you're going.
- |
  

- "Yes\x97definitely."
- |
  

- Oh wait, I thought that was your sister holding the ball.
- |
  

- For you, no.
- |
  

- Reply hazy.
- |
  

- Try again when I'm off the phone with my boyfriend.
- |
  

- Concentrate and ask again.
- |
  

- I can't abide poor grammar.
- |
  

- My reply is no.
- |
  

- Crying won't change things.
- |
  

- Ask again later.
- |
  

- Maybe in 20 years, when you'll understand what you put me through.
- |
  

- You may rely on it.
- |
  

- Let's just hope "it" can rely on you, too. Poor "it.
- |
  

- Yes.
- |
  

- As long as an adult is present and your grades are good.
- |
  

- So I guess it's actually no.
- |
  

- Most likely.
- |
  

- Especially if your friends are already doing it.
- |
  

- Cannot predict now.
- |
  

- But, if your past behavior is any indication, the results will include my picking you up at the police station at 4 a.m.
- |
  

- It is certain.
- |
  

- Everyone blames the mother.
