- What if a man, seeing his reflection in the still water of an autumn lake, took it for another man?
- |
  

- What if he waved to that man, and seeing the man wave back, got a little excited, as we all do when our social forays are repaid in kind, instead of ending in embarrassment and shame as they usually do?
- |
  

- And what if that man, the first man, that is, the one looking in the pool, not the reflection, now, took a step into the lake so he could shake that man's hand, the hand of a fellow human being?
- |
  

- Would we not call that man an optimist?
- |
  

- No, we would not.
- |
  

- We would call him something else.
- |
  

- But I'll be polite and not repeat it here.
- |
  

- A fox wants to get some grapes.
- |
  

- But the grapes are very high up on the side of the Empire State Building and he cannot reach them.
- |
  

- So, he decides that maybe he doesn't want any grapes after all.
- |
  

- Maybe he'd rather have a burger or something.
- |
  

- He is kidding himself, of course.
- |
  

- He would spit on his mother for those grapes.
- |
  

- Too bad that foxes don't know how to use elevators.
- |
  

- A hare challenges a tortoise to a race.
- |
  

- The tortoise accepts.
- |
  

- The hare chuckles to himself, knowing that all the bookmakers will have read that fable about the tortoise and the hare and give him long odds.
- |
  

- What the hare does not realize is that the tortoise drives a Testarossa.
- |
  

- A man is locked in his attic.
- |
  

- At first, he is frightened, and a bit claustrophobic.
- |
  

- Before long, however, he discovers there are many aspects to his attic that he had previously overlooked.
- |
  

- He explores old trunks, spilling over with tchachkes, gimcracks and other proverbial objects implying quaint clutter.
- |
  

- He breathes in what, at first, seemed to him to be the musty smell of dead things, but which he now realizes is the rich aroma of history.
- |
  

- Eventually, he dies of starvation.
- |
  

- "Lesson: Do not get locked in an attic."
- |
  

- Two young girls take turns skipping rope.
- |
  

- After a while, the second girl gets tired of always having to wait for the first girl to finish and she devises a crafty plan.
- |
  

- The next time it is her turn to skip rope, she will simply never stop skipping!
- |
  

- Then her turn arrives.
- |
  

- Soon, the first girl begins getting agitated.
- |
  

- She asks when the other girl is planning on stopping.
- |
  

- Tears well up in her eyes.
- |
  

- She goes to get her mother, but her mother is not home, her mother is off having a liaison with the new gas station attendant.
- |
  

- She comes back, hoping to find that the other girl has gotten tired and quit, but she has not.
- |
  

- The first girl tries many, many things, humiliating things, self-abasing things, things that you would hesitate to tell a drunken bum in a gutter to get the rope back, all for naught.
- |
  

- Forty years later, the second girl is still skipping that rope.
- |
  

- Her life has probably been fairly unfulfilling, but she is in terrific shape.
- |
  

- Imagine that you are five years older.
- |
  

- Imagine that, over the course of those five years, you got a tattoo.
- |
  

- What would it say?
- |
  

- Would you be embarrassed by it?
- |
  

- Then why did you get it in the first place, for crying out loud?
- |
  

- I don't see why you'd waste good money getting something you wouldn't want to show people.
- |
  

- You're just a rotten spendthrift!
- |
  

- Get your life together, already!
- |
  

- Wow, that was cathartic.
- |
  

- Okay, now imagine that you're  ten  years older.
- |
  

- Three giraffes see a wallet lying in the street.
- |
  

- I know giraffes don't need money, but let's pretend they do, for the sake of the fable, okay?
- |
  

- They all try to pick it up, but they can't get their heads close enough to the ground.
- |
  

- Then the fox runs up and grabs the wallet, using the money to go  buy  some grapes!
- |
  

- I guess the fox wins after all!
- |
  

- Good for you, Mr. Fox!
