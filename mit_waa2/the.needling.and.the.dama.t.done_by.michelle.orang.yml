  It is regrettably easy being Orange.
  Considered across the years, the unrelenting lack of wit displayed
  by my
  grammar-school colleagues still rankles. I am storyless. Without
  exposition. "Orange Peel"? "Michelle Purple?" These are not the stuff
  that psychic scars are made of. If only I had gone to a private boys'
  school out of a Robertson Davies novel or the
  youth of Prince Charles, I could have, for one thing, worn short
  pants. For another, I could have been monikered definitively,
  resourcefully.
  The prank calls were even more remedial. "Is Mr. Banana there?" made
  quick work of we Oranges on many a dishwasher-loading evening. Now,
  while leaning lamely at parties or lodged dumbly in tavern booths, I
  nurture revisionist dreams of kumquat rinds coiled about my ears,
  pith-stuffed lunch boxes and orange zest wafting from freshly opened
  textbooks. Oh, my faraway gaze while describing the merciless
  cloakroom raids!  Slicked in sugary goo from jamming my hands into
  creamsicle-stuffed pockets, I am suddenly surrounded by gimlet-eyed
  pointers and jeerers, trilling a song of sticky little Orange girls they
  have composed just for me.
  No, none of this. No character-building. No chest-hair-inducing.
  Just "Is
  Mr. Banana there?" No, my Wildean prankster, you've got the wrong
  fruit.
  Where have you gone, Mark West, Brent Dwyn&#151;even you, Anita Veel?
  Where
  were you in the first place?
  When asked by well-meaning and often fetching strangers if I was
  teased as a child, I am forced to demur. "It could have been worse,"
  I say, not a little wistfully.
  It's not like I didn't do my part: braces, bad hair, top marks. Easy
  to find, too&#151;when I wasn't babysitting the junior k's I was covering
