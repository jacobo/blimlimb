- "\"Well, duhhhh&#8230; let's see."

- What's unique  about the place where I work?
- |
  

- Duhhh&#8230; it's a prison.
- "Q: I know, I just mean&#8230; like, what's the&#8230; strangest part of your  job, I guess?"
- "Keller: Okay, well&#8230; that's the strangest part."
- "Q: Right."
- |
  

- The strangest part is the cemetery part?
- "Keller: Well, it's not the landscaping."
- |
  

- A lot of people mow lawns.
- "Q: Yeah."
- "Keller:"
- "Q: Okay, well&#8230;"
- "Keller: I guess I'm just not sure what you want to know."
- "Q: No, I know."
- |
  

- I guess&#8230; just.
- |
  

- Well, actually this is fine.
- |
  

- Maybe I'll  call you later if I think of something else.
- |
  

- But, yeah.
- |
  

- Okay.
- |
  

- Thanks.
