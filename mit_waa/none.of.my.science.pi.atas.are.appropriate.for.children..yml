  1.\n\
  Hydrochloric-Acid-Filled Pi\xF1atas\n\
  Good: Have the sturdy construction required to ensure no unintended \n\
  leakage of contents.\n\
  Bad: Possible severe burning. Brings the party down.\n\
  2.\n\
  Endangered-Animal Pi\xF1atas\n\
  Good: Kids love animals. High potential for very cute-looking pi\xF1atas, \n\
  like baby seals, for instance.\n\
  Bad: Beating with a stick sort of sends the wrong message.\n\
  3.\n\
  Particle-Accelerator Pi\xF1atas\n\
  Good: Built full-scale and often several miles in dimension. Therefore, young children find them easy to hit.\n\
  Bad: Each one worth several billion dollars. Parents generally not keen on damaging them.\n\
  4.\n\
  Smallpox ( Variola major ) Pi\xF1atas\n\
  Good: Cool virus shape.\n\
  Bad: Highly contagious and high mortality rate. Would also bring party down\x97as well as everyone else within a 100-mile radius.\n\
  5.\n\
  Infinity-Symbol Pi\xF1atas\n\
  Good: Possibly a way to address the often reported decline of mathematics education.\n\
  Bad: Thinking about infinity makes my head hurt. Now imagine having to explain it to a child over and over again.\n\
  6.\n\
  Pi\xF1atas in the Shape of the USA and Filled With the Greenhouse Gas Carbon Dioxide\n\
  Good: Sort of work as a metaphor for the United States' role in the global-warming crisis.\n\
  Bad: Unfortunately, the irony would be totally wasted on a 5-year-old.\n\
