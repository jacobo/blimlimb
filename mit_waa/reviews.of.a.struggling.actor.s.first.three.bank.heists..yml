  First National Bank  \n ROCHESTER, NEW YORK \n\
  APRIL 2, 2008\n\
  \"What a performance! Even though he had a gun and told us to lie down and stare at the floor and not look at him\x97or else!\x97it was impossible to not follow his every move and give two thumbs up!\" \n\
  \x97Customer\n\
  \"We've been robbed I can't tell you how many times, but this thief's inspired performance really made this one special.\" \n\
  \x97Teller\n\
  \"He was a one-man  Bonnie and Clyde , wielding Warren Beatty's panache\n\
  and style, and a touch of Faye Dunaway's glamour to keep you intrigued. This heist was very, very entertaining and very, very real: he took us for $24,812!\" \n\
  \x97Branch manager\n\
  \"A robbery of the highest order. This one is for the ages. Bravo!\" \n\
  \x97 Rochester Democrat and Chronicle  editorial board\n\
  \"We're happy that no one was shot or killed.\" \n\
  \x97Police sergeant\n\
  Commerce Bank  \n ROCHESTER, NEW YORK \n\
  APRIL 5, 2008\n\
  \"Brilliant and unexpected, like using a change-counting machine at the opera, or hearing a loan officer soliloquize about why my home-refinancing loan will be approved.\" \n\
  \x97Customer\n\
  \"The overall effect was impressive, although this actor's mania led\n\
  him to take every cent from the institution, including a bag of change\n\
  from a 6-year-old.\" \n\
  \x97Customer\n\
  \"I carried a lucky quarter for 28 years, determined to use it only in\n\
  an emergency. When I saw this deft, charismatic actor in action, I\n\
  knew who would receive my quarter. It was fate. And I am happy he did\n\
  not maim or kill me. Good show!\" \n\
  \x97Account representative\n\
  \"I feel lucky to be alive\x97this was a very life-affirming armed robbery.\" \n\
  \x97Customer\n\
  \"Most times, robbers steal our cash. Rarely do they also steal our\n\
  hearts. Our bank team really fell big for this guy. We welcome the\n\
  return of the robber we've taken to calling Rob!\" \n\
  \x97Branch manager\n\
  Wachovia Bank  \n ROCHESTER, NEW YORK \n\
  APRIL 7, 2008\n\
  \"In terms of acting, it was  Ocean's Eleven  meets  Ocean's Twelve \n\
  meets  Ocean's Thirteen \x97and then fork over all your cash.\" \n\
  \x97Teller\n\
  \"As surely as he stole our daily deposits and our savings, he has also swiped our hearts. Huzzah!\" \n\
  \x97Customer\n\
  \"As I lay on the floor with my hands above my head, I kept thinking, 'I love my wife. I love my daughter. I want to see them again.' The robbery really reminded me of what's important in life.\" \n\
  \x97Customer\n\
  \"His conservative charcoal suit and elementary pistol were more awkward than I'd expected. But he made it work\x97he got away with $15,300.\" \n\
  \x97Teller\n\
  \"Sheer, disorienting brilliance that left the mind reeling and the vaults empty.\" \n\
  \x97Branch manager\n\
