  ( Utah, 1885.  ALBERT , a Mormon, is sitting on his porch, drinking lemonade. In the distance, his wife is picking flowers. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  There goes my fair Edwina. \n\
  She's a perfect mate and mother. \n\
  I love my wife so much \n\
  I think I'll take another.\n\
  (ALBERT 's friend  GEORGE  appears, also holding a glass of lemonade. )\n\
  GEORGE\n\
  Marriage is a sacred bond, \n\
  Of which perhaps you are too fond. \n\
  And are you not oversupplied \n\
  When you acquire a second bride?\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  Two heads are better than one, \n\
  Just like two cows and two desserts. \n\
  And four legs are better than two, \n\
  Sheathed in matching ankle skirts.\n\
  ( A young boy named  WARREN  is hiding in the bushes. )\n\
  WARREN\n\
  Fight, fight, \n\
  Blood and bone! \n\
  I hope somebody \n\
  Throws a stone.\n\
  (ALBERT  and  GEORGE  do not throw a stone. They sip their lemonade. )\n\
  GEORGE\n\
  I disagree \n\
  Respectfully.\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  I understand. Go live your life. \n\
  Go be a husband to one wife.\n\
  (ALBERT  and  GEORGE  sip their lemonade again. )\n\
  WARREN\n\
  Oh, come on! \n\
  What the eff? \n\
  A peaceful resolution? \n\
  Am I deaf? \n\
  I don't hear violence, \n\
  Rage, or retribution!\n\
  (ALBERT  and  GEORGE  embrace and part ways.  WARRREN  grumbles. Fade out. Fade in. In present-day Utah,  ALBERT , a direct descendant of the earlier  ALBERT , is still practicing polygamy. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  Nothing in this world \n\
  Beats holy matrimony, \n\
  But if I said one was enough \n\
  I'd be full of baloney.\n\
  Oh, \n\
  When you want your laundry done, \n\
  Call Wife One. \n\
  (Just call Wife One.) \n\
  Hungry for a bowl of stew? \n\
  Call Wife Two. \n\
  (Just call Wife Two.) \n\
  Wife Three might be at the store. \n\
  If you need to talk, just call Wife Four. \n\
  And if Wife Five just got her kicks \n\
  And feels tired, call Wife Six.\n\
  WIFE SIX\n\
  Would my husband desire \n\
  To presently retire \n\
  To our lovely marriage bed? \n\
  I reward the man I've wed.\n\
  WIFE THREE\n\
  I am back from the store, \n\
  Where I bought some new clothes. \n\
  My skirt might be too short: \n\
  An inch of my calf shows.\n\
  ( Life moves along nicely. One day,  ALBERT  encounters  WARREN JEFFS , a direct descendant of the original  WARREN  and another member of the polygamous community. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  Hey, Warren\x97 \n\
  How's it hanging?\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  This is my chance \n\
  For some haranguing.\n\
  (WARREN JEFFS  tries to convince  ALBERT  that his brand of polygamy is misguided. )\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  I read our good book, \n\
  And, on more than one page, \n\
  It said in plain language \n\
  Wives should be underage. \n\
  I met your fourth wife and I started to gag. \n\
  What is she\x9719? That's foul! That old hag! \n\
  A wife who's over 18 is gross. \n\
  A wife should be 14 at most.\n\
  (ALBERT  defends his fourth wife's honor and objects to  WARREN JEFFS 's general philosophy. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  I have read of an ancient \n\
  Rift in our sect, \n\
  Where two beliefs \n\
  Did disconnect. \n\
  You have your ways \n\
  And I have mine. \n\
  We both can live \n\
  In the divine.\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  Listen to me: \n\
  I'm a big shot, you see, \n\
  In this place of multiple marriage. \n\
  I'm not just a resident\x97 \n\
  I'm prophet and president. \n\
  So don't you dare disparage \n\
  My views \n\
  If I choose \n\
  To marry them tender, \n\
  Wide-eyed, and slender.\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  I prefer to plural-marry adults. \n\
  I'm more comfortable with the results.\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  I am a direct descendant \n\
  Of both Smith (Joseph) and Christ (Jesus). \n\
  Young girls are resplendent. \n\
  They were put on earth to please us.\n\
  Twelve or thirteen's not too early. \n\
  Go and ask the Lord above. \n\
  He made them able to conceive \n\
  And to receive every inch of my love.\n\
  I won't rest until the day comes when \n\
  Nubile girls hook up with older men. \n\
  Like Dick Cheney and his third wife, Miley Cyrus, \n\
  We'll soon overcome this monogamous virus!\n\
  ( Angry that  ALBERT  will not listen,  WARREN JEFFS  consolidates power in the community and then sends  ALBERT  and his family into exile. )\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  I'll give you the week \n\
  To clear out of this town. \n\
  I think that's awfully big of me.\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  I'm going to seek \n\
  A place to bunk down \n\
  And practice my polygamy.\n\
  (ALBERT  takes his extended family down to Eldorado, Texas.  GEORGE , a Texan who happens to be a direct descendant of the original  GEORGE , is sitting on his porch drinking lemonade. )\n\
  GEORGE\n\
  We don't have much news round here. \n\
  It's been a very quiet year. \n\
  Killer bees stung an old man. He died. \n\
  A guy in town bought some wood and tried \n\
  To build himself a private sauna. \n\
  He didn't finish, and I don't think he's gonna.\n\
  (GEORGE  sees the trucks coming. He puts down his glass of lemonade. )\n\
  GEORGE\n\
  What in the blazes? \n\
  This dust cloud amazes \n\
  Me and fills me with fear. \n\
  We don't have much news round here, \n\
  But now there's a giant human tornado \n\
  Headed right toward Eldorado.\n\
  ( The trucks pull up.  ALBERT  steps out.  GEORGE  steps forward. )\n\
  GEORGE\n\
  From the cut of your clothes \n\
  And the boxes you're carrying, \n\
  You look like those freaks \n\
  Who just can't stop marrying.\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  We're not stupid. \n\
  We're not dense. \n\
  We understand our \n\
  Sect's offense.\n\
  But don't judge us harshly \n\
  Without giving us a chance. \n\
  After that, we'll accept \n\
  Why you've taken your stance.\n\
  (ALBERT  takes  GEORGE  to the compound. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  The setting is rural. \n\
  The marriage is plural. \n\
  Think of us as an \n\
  Independent nation. \n\
  There are nuclear families \n\
  And nuclear proliferation.\n\
  WIVES 1\x9610\n\
  We do precisely what we're told. \n\
  The golden rule is compliance. \n\
  How is it any different from \n\
  The Uniats or Christian Science?\n\
  WIVES 11\x9620\n\
  We love our kids, and others', too. \n\
  Family means everything to us. \n\
  And yet we're treated like felons. \n\
  Frankly, we don't understand the fuss.\n\
  WIVES 21\x9630\n\
  Our smiles are broad, our hearts are cheered, \n\
  Our consciences have long since cleared, \n\
  And nothing ever goes astray, \n\
  Except, of course, on Mother's Day.\n\
  (GEORGE  and  ALBERT  retire to  ALBERT 's porch, each with a glass of lemonade. They talk. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  I go about my business. \n\
  I keep a level head. \n\
  I say my prayers each night \n\
  Before I go to bed. \n\
  And then I kiss my wives, \n\
  Each and every one. \n\
  It takes about an hour \n\
  Before I'm finally done. \n\
  I'm not bragging. I'm just saying: \n\
  My life is full of loving and praying \n\
  And working and playing and laughing and breeding, \n\
  Here in this little West Texas Eden.\n\
  GEORGE\n\
  Well, golly gee, \n\
  I've come to see \n\
  That life is not so one-dimensional. \n\
  For my part, \n\
  I think I'll start \n\
  By embracing the unconventional.\n\
  (GEORGE  returns to Eldorado. For a little while, everyone is happy. Birds land in flower boxes. The sun shines brightly. Back in Utah,  WARREN JEFFS , who has been convicted of sexual conduct with a minor and jailed, remains furious at  ALBERT . )\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  I was born to rule, \n\
  I was made to lead, \n\
  But that jackass Albert \n\
  Didn't heed \n\
  My word when I spoke. \n\
  He thought me a joke. \n\
  Now he'll learn \n\
  How it feels to burn.\n\
  (WARREN JEFFS  calls the police in Texas and reports that there are underage girls being kept captive and sexually abused at  ALBERT 's compound. )\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  Hello, hello\x97my voice is high. \n\
  Come rescue me, please, and come quick. \n\
  I'm being forced to have sex and stuff. \n\
  The guy in charge is really sick. \n\
  His name is Albert. He's so mean. \n\
  Did I mention that I'm just 16?\n\
  ( Police are dispatched to the compound. )\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  Officer, what can I help you with? \n\
  Would you like to learn more about Joseph Smith?\n\
  ( One of  ALBERT 's wives walks by and smiles at the  OFFICER . )\n\
  OFFICER\n\
  She looks like Laura Ingalls Wilder. \n\
  Now let's find out who defiled her.\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  I'm sorry. I'm confused. \n\
  No one here has been abused, \n\
  Or harmed, in fact, in any way. \n\
  This whole thing fills me with dismay. \n\
  It's just me and the missis and the missis, \n\
  Living here in wedded blisses.\n\
  OFFICER\n\
  People in this community \n\
  Do not possess immunity \n\
  From the nation's laws. They exist \n\
  Even for polygamists, \n\
  And so, although you may protest, \n\
  It's time now to make an arrest.\n\
  (ALBERT  is arrested. Four hundred and sixteen children from the compound are seized. The girl who made the call is never located.  ALBERT  lingers in prison as the compound's tangled custody case is resolved. He is pardoned by President Romney and released from jail. He returns to find his community shattered and dispersed.  WARREN JEFFS , who has also been pardoned by President Romney, is sitting in a chair in the middle of the compound. There is an empty glass of lemonade beside him. )\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  You should have listened \n\
  When I talked that day. \n\
  You shouldn't have just walked away. \n\
  You could have avoided \n\
  The strain, the stress, \n\
  The holy hell, \n\
  The unholy mess.\n\
  ALBERT\n\
  Go ahead. \n\
  You broke me. \n\
  I'm all ears.\n\
  WARREN JEFFS\n\
  Not now\x97 \n\
  I'm dreaming of \n\
  Jamie-Lynn Spears.\n\
  (ALBERT  picks up a stone and hits  WARREN JEFFS  on the head. )\n\
