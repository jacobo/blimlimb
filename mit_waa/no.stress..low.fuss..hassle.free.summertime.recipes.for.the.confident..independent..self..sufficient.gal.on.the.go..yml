  Lemon Chicken\n\
  This simple recipe is the perfect answer to the age-old question \"What's for dinner?\" Unfortunately, what you really need is an answer to the question \"Why does every man eventually leave you?\" But let's deal with dinner first! For best results, use fresh-picked-earlier-that-day-by-workers-not-being-exploited lemons from Venezuela. If this is impossible, then skip the lemon part altogether. If feeling guilty about wasting animals again, simply use the  entire  chicken, and not just the fashionable \"breast\" portion. Summer lemon neck never tasted so good! Chicken is also best if organic and fresh that day, from Venezuela. If this is impossible, better just to ask your boyfrie\x97 Better just to order Chinese and enjoy a quiet night hiding under the comforter. Easy!\n\
  Spicy Veggie Stir-Fry\n\
  If you're a vegetarian, then this is the dish for you. If you're not a vegetarian, then maybe you should consider becoming one. Could you be scaring away men with the amount of meat you eat? Veggie stir-fry is a fuss-free way to make sure you're getting your 5 to 17 recommended servings of vegetables a day. (Sound overwhelming? Eating lots of vegetables is much easier when working as a team. Try creating a sensible meal plan with your husban\x97 Try liquefying your vegetables and pouring them in the humidifier. Presto!) Don't have a wok? Just eat three big bags of baby carrots and a can of okra. Recent studies have shown that okra is likely to reduce the chances of breast cancer, HPV, and pregnancy.* So eat up!\n\
  * Not having a male companion will also reduce the chance of pregnancy.\n\
  Veal Cutlet\n\
  Sure to please any crowd, or\x97in the event that you have no crowd to please\x97you. Breaded veal is a delicious, timeless, mouthwatering entr\xE9e. Of course, it is really unhealthy to have breaded anything! In order not to feel horrible about yourself for the remainder of the evening, grill, steam, or simply don't eat the veal. Now, certain eaters can always be relied upon to argue that the concept of veal is cruel and that no baby cow should be subjected to such inhumane treatment (even though we are talking about  cows  here, folks). These people should calm down and live a little. Cows are hilarious, and veal is delicious! Bon app\xE9tit!\n\
  Fried Beef Ravioli, Cajun French Fries, and Four-Cheese Lasagna\n\
  Wouldn't that be delicious? Too bad God had to go and invent upper-thigh fat.\n\
  Caribbean Pork and Couscous Salad\n\
  This spirited summer meal will add that extra spring to your step. First, put the pork cubes and the Caribbean rub inside a plastic bag and shake well. Next, skewer the pork and grill over a medium-hot fire for eight minutes.  Do not overcook. Overcooking  the pork cubes will cause irreversible damage, destroying the meal beyond repair. Why can't you do anything right?  Not overcooking  the pork cannot be emphasized enough. If you  overcook  the pork, you will dry out all of the juices and the cellulite on your stomach will automatically become more pronounced. If you think you are on the verge of  overcooking  the pork cubes,  remove the pork from the fire immediately and take a minute to re-evaluate . Does your life have an actual purpose? Better to err on the side of not-cooked-enough** rather than  overcooked .\n\
  ** In order to avoid any number of life-threatening bacterial diseases that will cause you to die alone, be sure to cook meat thoroughly.\n\
  Linguine With Shrimp Scampi\n\
  A nice, light, healthful summer treat. If done correctly, this yummy dish can be prepared in minutes! If done incorrectly, this dish can single-handedly ruin your entire evening by creating sickening levels of frustration, inescapable feelings of incompetence/helplessness/loneliness, and burnt scampi. Great with a side of field greens!\n\
  Chicken Soup\n\
  Often considered a cure for the winter blahs, this meal works for the summer blahs as well. Haven't experienced the summer blahs yet? Oh. Who are you taking to Donovan and Shelly's wedding next month? Who did you dance with at Stuart and Brooke's last weekend? What exactly is the point of moving from your studio apartment into a one-bedroom? There we go. Chicken soup!\n\
  Four Large Bottles of Evian Water\n\
  Actually, this is probably all you really need tonight.\n\
