  ( Time: The past. A teenage  MARK McGWIRE  is playing baseball. He hits a home run, rounds the bases, slaps the hands of his friends in celebration, then jogs \n\
  home, where he immediately bursts into tears. )\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  I'm skinny. \n\
  I'm scrawny.  \n\
  I'd rather be brawny.  \n\
  But bulking up is such hard labor.  \n\
  I won't do It without \n\
  An easier route.  \n\
  Maybe I'll go ask my neighbor.\n\
  (McGWIRE  trots next door, where he finds his friend,  JOSE CANSECO . )\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  Say, Jose,  \n\
  Do you figure \n\
  There's a way \n\
  I can get bigger?\n\
  (CANSECO  explains the benefits of steroids. )\n\
  JOSE CANSECO\n\
  They say, \"God-given talent.\" \n\
  I don't believe in God. \n\
  It's left to me to maximize \n\
  A bicep or a quad.\n\
  They say, \"Use what God gave you.\" \n\
  I don't think that's so wise.  \n\
  You want to have two tree trunks \n\
  Instead of human thighs.\n\
  So come on, Mark,  \n\
  Do just what I say.  \n\
  It'll only be a problem \n\
  'Til you see what you weigh.\n\
  ( Curtain falls. )\n\
  ( Curtain rises. )\n\
  ( Time: The present. Congress has convened special hearings on the use of \n\
  steroids in baseball. )\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  Do steroids make you cry?  \n\
  I find that I am tearing \n\
  Up and don't know why.  \n\
  I move to end this hearing.\n\
  CONGRESSMAN\n\
  We are here today \n\
  And vested with authority \n\
  To investigate this issue. \n\
  It's our number-one priority.  \n\
  It has come to our attention \n\
  That baseball players sometimes can grow giant. \n\
  The league has banned the substances \n\
  That cause this rapid growth. Are you compliant?\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  Man, I'm really bawling.  \n\
  This awkward situation \n\
  Is totally appalling.  \n\
  Have I mentioned my foundation?\n\
  CONGRESSMAN\n\
  It is my suggestion \n\
  That you answer the question\n\
  (McGWIRE  cannot answer. He is crying. Other baseball players do answer, one \n\
  by one. They swing bats as they testify. )\n\
  JASON GIAMBI\n\
  I apologize, I apologize. \n\
  I'll tell it to you straight: \n\
  My dream in life is hitting \n\
  More than .208.\n\
  SAMMY SOSA\n\
  I never did it in Chicago.  \n\
  It's something I abhor.  \n\
  I packed my bags and happily  \n\
  Moved off to Baltimore.\n\
  RAFAEL PALMIERO\n\
  I never did it as an Oriole. \n\
  It's something I abhor \n\
  I packed my bags and happily \n\
  Departed Baltimore. \n\
  (I left in '98 and came back in 2004.)\n\
  JOSE CANSECO\n\
  Do I use? Of course!  \n\
  I'm as big as a freaking horse. \n\
  But not all muscles \n\
  Are created equal. \n\
  I would be remiss \n\
  If I didn't mention this:  \n\
  My testicles (and the resticles)   \n\
  have experienced some shrinkage. \n\
  To illustrate their horrendous fate \n\
  You'd have to have an average man stand next to Peter Dinklage.\n\
  JASON GIAMBI\n\
  I apologize, I apologize. \n\
  I just can't say what for.  \n\
  Mark: You can stop crying.  \n\
  You're not talking anymore.\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  I'm sobbing like a baby. \n\
  My shirt and tie are soaked.  \n\
  I haven't wept this much \n\
  Since the '88 A's choked.  \n\
  Hershisher just shut us down like we were a joke.\n\
  ( As the players talk,  BARRY BONDS  rises from his underground crypt in San Francisco to read from a prepared statement. )\n\
  BARRY BONDS\n\
  Once upon a time there was a man named Aaron. \n\
  Once upon a time before there was a man named Ruth. \n\
  The first one makes some sense\x97there are lots of men named Aaron. \n\
  The second one, I am assured, is strange but still the truth.\n\
  I raise the issue of these men for one specific reason. \n\
  Both of them are very great but not as great as me. \n\
  One hit seven fourteen, the other seven fifty-five.  \n\
  I'll end up with eight hundred. You just wait and see.\n\
  Oh ...  \n\
  Some still doubt \n\
  I can hit them out \n\
  Without the help of drugs. \n\
  Have you seen me swing?  \n\
  I am everything.  \n\
  Those pinhead racist thugs.  \n\
  I insist \n\
  When I top the list \n\
  Of the best to play this game, \n\
  The clear that I took \n\
  Shouldn't keep me from the record book. \n\
  Children far and wide should know my name.\n\
  ( Back at the hearings. )\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  That song was just so touching. \n\
  Sportswriters sure are jerks.  \n\
  They follow you, they hound you ... \n\
  Here come the waterworks.\n\
  CONGRESSMAN\n\
  We have done our part  \n\
  In preserving baseball's purity.  \n\
  But let's wrap this up right now \n\
  And fix Social Security.\n\
  ( Most of the players decline to make final statements. )\n\
  JOSE CANSECO\n\
  From the dead-ball era to the small-ball era, \n\
  Baseball's been resilient.  \n\
  (I know that seems like a big word \n\
  But I'm really rather brilliant.)  \n\
  I even wrote a slogan that sums up what I think:  \n\
  \"Performance enhancement  \n\
  Is professional advancement.\"  \n\
  Doesn't matter if we're talking needle, cream, or drink.  \n\
  Drugs are drugs: they have no place in the game. \n\
  We can't permit cocaine and marijuana, \n\
  But keep out steroids and you will ruin the magic!  \n\
  Did I mention that I once dated Madonna?\n\
  ( Time: The past. A teenage  MARK McGWIRE  is still crying. )\n\
  MARK McGWIRE\n\
  I'm skinny.  \n\
  I'm scrawny.  \n\
  I'd rather be brawny.  \n\
  But bulking up takes so much work and time.  \n\
  If only I could \n\
  Cut corners, I would.  \n\
  There's dignity in a victimless crime.  \n\
  Oh,  \n\
  There's dignity in a victimless crime.\n\
