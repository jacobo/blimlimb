  I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it.\n\
  He gets put out if you walk by the color red, too. Doesn't necessarily have to be in a field. Could be anywhere.\n\
  If you walk by orange? Like, at HoJo's? He gets irked. No, wait\x97more like nettled. He'll be peevish, I guarantee that.\n\
  Yellow, you better be like, \"Oh, wow, yellow,\" or He'll get all cranky with you.\n\
  Don't go ignoring green, whatever you do.  Man , does He get hot under the collar if you ignore green.\n\
  Blue? Choleric, I swear.\n\
  Overlook indigo and He goes right through the roof. I mean it, He'll rip the top of your head right off.\n\
  If you walk by the color violet, He goes fucking ballistic.\n\
