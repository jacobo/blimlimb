  INT. TALKING HEAD\x97DAY\n\
  STANLEY: The office smells vaguely of shit. It gets so you don't mind. That's the worst of it. You know how long I've been here? Too long. When you die you're going to regret the things you didn't do. You think you're a pervert? I'm going to tell you something. We're all perverts. You're a thief. So be it. Befuddled by corporate morality? Shut it out. You think you're going to hell? Too late. Hell exists on earth. Here. At Dunder-Mifflin.\n\

  MICHAEL: I can't do it. Money's tight. You know how much those leads cost.\n\
  DWIGHT: I need my balls back. My girlfriend, she's ... I can get hot. You know that.\n\
  MICHAEL: You blew the last ...\n\
  DWIGHT: Come on. Jim's throwing the Abington leads away. All I'm asking for ...\n\
