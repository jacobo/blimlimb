  1.
  HILLARY CLINTON
  Pro:  Known commodity; strong fundraiser.
  Con:  Polarizing; unlikely to woo those already opposed to her.
  2.
  BARACK OBAMA
  Pro:  Articulate; resembles foxy actor Blair Underwood.
  Con:   L.A. Law  was kind of overrated now that you think about it.
  3.
  JOHN EDWARDS
  Pro:  Has strong appeal to working-class voters.
  Con:  As a resident of two Americas, he must raise twice as much money and spend twice as much time campaigning.
  4.
  BILL RICHARDSON
  Pro:  Appeals to all Latino voters with the last name "Richardson."
  Con:  New Mexico is legally part of Mexico; therefore, he's constitutionally ineligible.
  5.
  JOE BIDEN
  Pro:  Technically still running for president.
  Con:  Dude. Come on.
  6.
  DICK CHENEY  
  IN AN ELABORATE LATEX DISGUISE  
  THAT TAKES FIVE HOURS TO APPLY
  Pro:  Trojan horse, my friend. Trojan fucking horse.
  Con:  Ruse would be so exciting that he would surely drop dead of a massive stroke about a month before Iowa.
  7.
  OPTIMUS PRIME
  Pro:  Size; power; ability to emit short-range optic blasts.
  Con:  Potential attack ad: "Sometimes Optimus Prime is a robot, other times a truck. Which is it, Mr. Prime? America deserves a leader that doesn't transform whenever it's convenient."

  Con:  None.
  9.
  DENNIS KUCINICH
  Pro:  Solid anti-war stance; adorable; strong to the finich.
  Con:  Election laws limit magical pixies to only one term in office.
  10.
  JIMMY CARTER

  Con:  Judging by photos, approximately 415 years old.
  11.
  ALLEN IVERSON
  Pro:  Instant offense.
  Con:  Selfish with the ball; may have lost a step.
  12.
  IRA GLASS
  Pro:  Thoughtful; self-effacing; like many Americans, enjoys cable television.
  Con:  At present, no budget line item exists for moody introspective music to underscore every statement president makes in order to make it sound more poignant.
  13.
  BONO
  Pro:  Knowledgeable about global health issues; everyone seems to like him;  Joshua Tree  album.
  Con:  Too busy hugging everyone to actually execute the duties of office; no one likes the sound of "Vice President the Edge" or "Secretary of Health and Human Services Larry Mullen Jr."; the whole "Zoo TV" thing.
  14.
  AL GORE
  Pro:  Knows how to get to the White House, where to park, location of restrooms.
  Con:  Wants to accomplish something meaningful.

  Con:  None.
  16.
  JESUS CHRIST
  Pro:  Could draw some initial interest from the Christian right until they research his actual positions in a deeper way; likable; strong leadership qualities.
  Con:  Unkempt; pretty far left; messianic complex.
  17.
  THAT ONE GUY WHO SEEMED REALLY COOL
  Pro:  Remember? He was a senator or congressman or something? It was a while ago. He seemed super-smart but also normal. I saw him this one time.
  Con:  Crap, what was his name? Or was it a lady? Do you know who I'm talking about? Crap.
  18.
  ZOMBIE LYNDON JOHNSON
  Pro:  Could sway red-state voters as well as  Fangoria  crowd; '60s-era campus unrest has died down.
  Con:  Tendency to groan instead of talk could hurt chances in live debates; constant need to feed on fresh brains could limit campaigning.
  19.
  OPRAH WINFREY
  Pro:  Popular; influential; could rally the silent masses already violently opposed to Jonathan Franzen.
  Con:  May only exacerbate nationwide Maya Angelou plague that has decimated much of the nation.
  20.
  YOU
  Pro:  Gained valuable exposure as  Time  magazine's Person of the Year; seems to be Internet-savvy.
