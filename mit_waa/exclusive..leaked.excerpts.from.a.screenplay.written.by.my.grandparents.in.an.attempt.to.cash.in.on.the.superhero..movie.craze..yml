  INT. CONDO OF JUSTICE\x97DAY\n\
  (GENIUS MAN  and  CLASSY LADY  are receiving top-secret e-mails from the  PRESIDENT , when disaster strikes. A strange noise, then the screen turns black. )\n\
  GENIUS MAN: It's Mr. Internet. He's locked us out of American Online's Internets ... again!\n\
  CLASSY LADY: Blast! If we don't stop him, he'll soon gain control of the world's children, while they're surfing the World Wide Web!\n\
  GENIUS MAN: Off to Mr. Internet's lair, on Microsoft Computer Island! To the GeniusMobile!\n\
  CLASSY LADY: The GeniusMobile has been sounding funny. Did you get it checked like I asked?\n\
  GENIUS MAN: I was doing our taxes. I'll get to it this week. ( Grabs keys. )\n\
  CLASSY LADY: Remember your glasses this time. You almost ran over Sadie Zuckerman last Friday.\n\
  GENIUS MAN: That was because it was about to rain and you were talking to me. ( Pats his shirt. ) Where are those glasses?\n\
  CLASSY LADY: Where did you leave them?\n\
  GENIUS MAN: If I knew, I wouldn't be looking for them. Do we have time for a sandwich?\n\

  INT. CRIME-FIGHTING CAVE\x97DAY\n\
  (GOOD GIRL  and  SENSITIVE BOY  pace anxiously.  SENSITIVE BOY  looks like he's lost a little weight. )\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: I'm so worried about Classy Lady and Genius Man.\n\
  GOOD GIRL: How many times have you called?\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: ( Sheepishly. ) Today? Only five times.\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Only five times? But it's almost noon!\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: I know, but I thought ...\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Well, \"you thought\" ... and now Classy Lady and Genius Man are probably lying in a ditch somewhere, dead.\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: We should get a new crime-fighting cave, one close to the Condo of Justice. Maybe in that fancy new community where Cookie Lipshitz's son just got himself a very nice crime-fighting cave.\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Of course we should. What\x97we can't base our superhero business in Florida? Like New Jersey's so great?\n\
  (SENSITIVE BOY 's cellular telephone rings with one of those BlackBerry messages. )\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: It's one of those BlackBerry messages, from Genius Man.\n\
  GOOD GIRL: What's it say?\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: It says, \"Does your Microsoft computer have an Internet, mister?\" It's some kind of code! Jeez, Good Girl, you gotta help me! I'm only a superhero. Genius Man was an accountant!\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Eureka! He's telling us they're being held by Mr. Internet, on Microsoft Computer Island! I hope he's feeding them; Classy Lady has low blood sugar!\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: ( Inconsolable. ) It's all my fault. I should have called more.\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Maybe you'll call tomorrow ... if there is a tomorrow.\n\

  INT. MR. INTERNET'S STUFFY LAIR\x97DAY\n\
  (CLASSY LADY  and  GENIUS MAN  are tied up in ropes. No one has provided lunch.  GOOD GIRL  and  SENSITIVE BOY  burst in. )\n\
  MR. INTERNET: So ... you've found my lair on Microsoft Computer Island!\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Of course. We went to good colleges. Not Ivy League, but maybe if we had applied ourselves ... We certainly had the brains.\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: Now let Classy Lady and Genius Man go!\n\
  MR. INTERNET: How dare you speak in an outdoor voice at me! Now I will discombobulate you ... forever! Wait\x97why are you crying?\n\
  (CUT TO: SENSITIVE BOY  looking at his wallet photos. )\n\
  SENSITIVE BOY: ( Crying. ) These photos ... they remind me how beautiful it is when the whole family gets together. God forbid it should be more than once a year.\n\
  MR. INTERNET: ( Looking at photos, dropping to his knees. ) Gorgeous ... family ... Breaking me down ... My emotions ... Must resist ...\n\
  GOOD GIRL: Mr. Internet, did you know the average rainfall in Spain is 25 inches per year?\n\
  MR. INTERNET: How could you know that without using the World Almanac? Your intellect is causing my circuits to malfunction.\n\
  (CUT TO: CLASSY LADY  and  GENIUS MAN  grabbing  MR. INTERNET 's arms. )\n\
  MR. INTERNET: How did you two get free?\n\
  GENIUS MAN: Using superhuman math skills from all my years of being an accountant, I was able to figure out how to untie us.\n\
  CLASSY LADY: We're bringing you to justice, Mr. Internet. Or should I call you ... ( Removes  MR. INTERNET 's mask. ) ... Saddam Hitler?\n\
  MR. INTERNET: Blast! You have defeated me! Can I have my one telephone call?\n\
  CLASSY LADY: Is it long-distance?\n\
  GENIUS MAN: Don't worry, we can write it off. Who do you want to call, Saddam?\n\
  MR. INTERNET: Two people I should have called a long time ago. My grandparents, Ben and Estelle Hitler.\n\
  FADE OUT\x97THE END\n\
