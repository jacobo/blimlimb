  ME: For some reason, I can't get this report orb to beam.\n\
  HOTSHOT: Well, go ahead and materialize the topaz orb first. That should launch your facefield preferences.\n\
  ME: OK, here goes ... Wait, remind me, how do I get to the topaz orb? Sorry, I knew how to do this just a second ago\x97I imagine a shape, right?\n\
  HOTSHOT: Kind of. Defocus your eyes and visualize a beam of light illuminating a rhombus. That will materialize the topaz orb.\n\
  ME: Hmm ... It's still not working.\n\
  HOTSHOT: OK, let's back up a step. Which wormhole did you do your push-up in?\n\
  ME: I'm pretty sure it was Wormhole Gamma. But I did a sit-up. Does a sit-up not work?\n\
  HOTSHOT: Oh, you did a sit-up? ( Smirk. ) Yeah. That's  probably  why it's not working. Try it again.\n\
  ( I lie down and do a push-up. Immediately, a lifelike 3-D porno hologram materializes in my cubicle with the volume turned way up. Co-workers begin to gather. The hologram depicts me naked on the plank of a pirate spaceship with our company's robot intern, Suzanne. The scenario is dirty in a way not yet fully describable in our present age. )\n\
  ME: Turn it off!!\n\
  HOTSHOT: I can't. You have to double-imagine the red orb to quit out of iPerv.\n\
  ( I try desperately to materialize the red orb, but instead accidentally launch a hologram chat with my late grandfather from beyond the grave. )\n\
  GRANDFATHER HOLOGRAM: Where am I? Who's moved my reading chair?\n\
  ME: Granddad, I can explain. Hold on a sec ...\n\
  ( Swatting at my temples like a fevered gibbon, I accidentally materialize a mastodon diorama, Dabney Coleman, the color green, and John Coltrane's  Giant Steps  album. )\n\
