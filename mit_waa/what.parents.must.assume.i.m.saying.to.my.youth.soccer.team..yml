  Lucky break, Tigers\x97I talked to the ref and, for the next five minutes, we get a point every time we blow all the seeds off a dandelion in a single try. Go, Jenny, go!\n\

  James, I don't care if your father played soccer at Duke. It's my job to make sure you're a huge disappointment to him. Now pretend you're a magic airplane or else.\n\

  Nelson, watch out! The ball is now a horrible, child-eating monster and the only way to defeat it is by running away and crying.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Ralph! Hear me raise my voice slightly? Your parents need to come over and explain my shortcomings as a coach and a person.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Timmy! Nice aggression. I support your decision to give that kid a bloody nose, and you should resolve conflicts similarly at school and at home.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Nice half, guys! Remember, a true soccer player saves his energy for the sprint to the sideline\x97especially since I only have enough juice boxes for half of you.\n\

  Now, Christian, we're all about to make assumptions about your future sexuality, so make sure to run that way we practiced.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Tigers! I'm sure you'd never notice on your own, so I'll point out the apple-juice stain on Tim's crotch that looks suspiciously like urine. Stop what you're doing right now and laugh till he cries.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Nelson, don't panic, but that monster's back. Put your hands in your pants and pretend not to see it and you may survive.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Good game, guys. Remember: It doesn't matter whether you win or lose. What matters is that you all played worse than the Joneses' kid.\n\
