  A concerned father drops three boys (Peter, Dom, and Bj\xF6rn), three girls (Henrietta, Elaine, and Meghan), and his daughter (Lorelei) off at the local mall's theater. He wants to know which one of the boys will be making out with his daughter during the movie. He knows that each of the eighth-graders will make out at least once but not more than twice before the movie ends. He also knows that the following conditions must apply:\n\
  Elaine will not make out with Bj\xF6rn until she's made out with Peter (because she and Bj\xF6rn are in an open relationship and she's testing the waters).\n\
  Henrietta will not make out with Peter or Dom (because she only dates older guys).\n\
  If Lorelei makes out with both Henrietta and Elaine, then Peter and Bj\xF6rn will make out. (They made a bet.)\n\
  Meghan will always make out last (because she's ugly).\n\
  Dom will always be paired with Meghan (because he's desperate).\n\
