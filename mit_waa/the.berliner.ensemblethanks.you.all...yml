  Five years ago, McSweeney's published Marcel Dzama's  The Berlin Years ,\n\
  bringing Dzama's elegant, enigmatic bears, bats, and sexy ladies to a\n\
  slumbering nation. The first edition of that book was snapped up in a matter\n\
  of minutes, and the same thing happened with a second edition a couple of years later. We were thinking about a third printing, but then we thought: instead, why not do it\n\
  all new and all better?\n\
  So that's what we've done. The format is similar to the original: an\n\
  envelope with 28 loose-leaf prints good enough to frame, including\n\
  a hard-to-describe four-way four-parter (four drawings that fit together to\n\
  make one really large one, wherein any of the four connects to any of the\n\
  others, and in any configuration: four square, a vertical stack, all\n\
  horizontal, an L, etc.\x97any Tetris shape); plus a scrapbook; plus an insert\n\
  card; plus an oversized foldout poster. The artwork is entirely new, the\n\
  scrapbook is new, the envelope has been redesigned\x97it's a whole new thing,\n\
  in a beloved familiar shape. Get one for yourself, one for a friend, and\n\
  three for your helpless unborn grandchildren\x97they'll thank you someday.\n\
  Also: Five original Dzama drawings, on hotel stationery, have been sprinkled\n\
  in randomly. Sort of like Willy Wonka's golden tickets, except, instead of\n\
  winning a tour of a dangerous, racist chocolate factory, you get a hot\n\
  Marcel Dzama original. Today could be your lucky day.\n\
