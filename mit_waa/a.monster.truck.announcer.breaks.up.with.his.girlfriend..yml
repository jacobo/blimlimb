  K-K-K-  K-K-K ARENN NNNN  NNN,
  This SUNDAY  SUNDAY   SUNDAY , I'd like you to have all your stuff moved  OUT OUT OUT  of  MY MY MY APARTMENT APARTMENT APARTMENT , because I'm b-b-b-b-b-breaking up with YOU  YOU   YOU!!!  I don't know what to say, really. I feel b-b-b-b-bad about all this, but it's like we're just not c-c- c-c-  c-c-communicating  like we used to.
  Let's just be m-m-m-m- mature  about this and try to remain friends. We should get coffee sometime, in case one of us needs some  CLOSURE CLOSURE CLOSURE . I know no one  PLANS PLANS PLANS  for things to turn out this  WAY WAY WAY .
  Call me if you think this is a  MISTAKE  MISTAKE  MISTAKE   MISTAKE .
  Sorry, 
  Keith
