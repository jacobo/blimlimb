  To His Imperial Majesty, Aslan, the Great Lion, he who rises from uncomfortable and broken stone tables, son of the Emperor-Over-Sea, with extreme respect:\n\
  In the course of talking-animal events, it may become necessary for one animal\x97or human\x97or divine being\x97to come and rescue Narnia from its deepest, darkest hours. We're cool with that. We're just saying ...\n\
  Why does it have to be kids?\n\
  No offense to your wisdom and such, but, frankly, things don't go so well when they show up. Consider the results so far:\n\
  Visit 1\n\
  1. The illegal immigration of a dangerous terrorist responsible for annihilating the entire population of her previous world, thanks to the direct assistance of these kids.\n\
  2. Criminal disruption of a process critical to national security\x97namely, you, quietly and then gloriously, singing our magical world into existence, and us, quietly and a lot less gloriously, rising up from the mud, which we consider kind of important, if leading to very puzzling questions about our later biology and ecology.\n\
  3. And\x97oh, yeah\x97the first entrance of evil into Narnia, which transformed it from a place filled with merry singing to a sometimes dark and scary place filled with kidnappings, sacrifice, and war. (However, some of the signers of this letter wish to note that with evil often comes excellent beer, and they like the beer part, so: not entirely a bad thing.)\n\
  Visit 2\n\
  1. The sudden and terrible arrests of multiple Narnia residents, stemming entirely from the unauthorized visits of a small child to the forest area.\n\
  2. The sudden release of multiple dangerous creatures, who, until then, had been safely imprisoned as stone animals.\n\
  3. Your own bloody and demoralizing assassination.\n\
  4. The destruction of a valuable ancient stone table.\n\
  5. A major battle resulting in the injury and death of several Narnian citizens.\n\
  6. Restoration of a nonparticipatory monarchy, headed up by four children with limited education and absolutely no civil governing experience.\n\
  Visit 3\n\
  1. Eruption of war within days.\n\
  2. Major destruction of infrastructure, including a valuable bridge.\n\
  3. Multiple incidents of public drunkenness.\n\
  Visit 4\n\
  1. One kid turned into a dragon. Enough said.\n\
  Visit 5\n\
  1. Complete destruction of a vast and valuable underground city and mining complex.\n\
  Seeing the pattern here?\n\
  Frankly, we'd be less concerned were it not for our understanding that your true intentions are less to help us and more to help these children understand their own religion, which, we admit, sounds pretty confusing. End result: the kids get a deeply transforming religious experience, and we get left with shit. Excuse our language, but we're basically animals here.\n\
  (As a side note, did your foresight ever suggest recording that creation song? Because, from what we've heard from these kids, you could have made enough money from that recording to completely compensate us for the damages, at least financially. We're just saying.)\n\
  So, anyway, here's what we're getting at: Send us a hero. Send us a grownup. Send us someone capable of understanding the complex economic structure underlying Narnia, of understanding why destroying our mines is not exactly a major plus. Just stop sending us kids. And consider this message urgent. We understand that something called a last battle might be coming up soon, and we're a bit afraid that if you send us any more helpful kids they'll end up destroying our entire world. Sure, we could end up in some perfect magical mirror of it, but what are the chances of that?\n\
