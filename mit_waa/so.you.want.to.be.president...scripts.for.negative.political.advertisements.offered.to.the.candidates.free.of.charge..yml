  As the author of the definitive guide to running for the Oval Office,  So You Want to Be President?  (on sale now), I know at least as much about political campaigning as anyone else, which is to say, you should trust my opinion because it's mine. I have a few hard and fast rules about politics, the hardest and fastest of which is that, put simply, negative political advertising works. As anyone who has stood in front of a high-speed fan while someone dumped a bucket of manure into the blades can tell you, shit sticks.\n\
  In observing the 2008 campaign, I've noticed there's a certain staleness to the current crop of negative advertisements. Hillary Clinton recently recycled Walter Mondale's 1984 \"Red Phone\" ad in order to imply that Barack Obama's a heavy sleeper who might let a crisis call go to voicemail. So, as a public, nonpartisan service, I'll be creating a series of ready-to-produce scripts for negative political advertising that seek to freshen up the genre.\n\
  For illustration purposes, I'll be using a hypothetical opponent with a nondescript name, Herman Q. Asscrack. He's a United States senator.\n\

  INT. BANK\x97DAY\n\
  ( A group of  GUNMEN \x97who are wearing rubber masks bearing your opponent's likeness and wielding automatic weapons\x97bursts into a bank, yelling at the customers to \"get on their bleeping knees.\" The customers yell hysterically as the gunmen spray bullets into the ceiling and manhandle people to the ground. Cut to:   CUSTOMER 1 , lying on his stomach on the floor, looks up at  MAIN GUNMAN . )\n\
  CUSTOMER 1: ( Terrified. ) Please, Senator Asscrack. Haven't you grabbed enough of my money with your tax-and-spend votes in Congress already?\n\
  (GUNMAN 1  presses the muzzle of his weapon into  CUSTOMER 1 's cheek. )\n\
  GUNMAN 1: ( Cackling fiendishly. ) Enough? There's never enough!\n\
  ( Cut to:  CUSTOMER 2  climbing to her knees, then being pistol-whipped back to the ground by  GUNMAN 2 .  CUSTOMER 2  clutches at her bleeding head wound. )\n\
  CUSTOMER 2: ( Wailing. ) At least use our hard-earned money to pay off the national debt or strengthen our military readiness!\n\
  (GUNMAN 2  delivers a second blow to  CUSTOMER 2 , knocking her completely unconscious.  GUNMAN 3  joins  GUNMAN 2  to lift  CUSTOMER 2  off the ground. Together, they hold her upside down and shake coins out of her pockets. Cut to:  GUNMAN 1  jumping up on the counter and unleashing another hail of bullets into the ceiling. )\n\
  GUNMAN 1: ( Cackling even more fiendishly. ) Ha! I'll use it for whatever I want to! I may just build giant golden statues of myself and adorn them with precious rubies and diamonds.\n\
  ( Freeze-frame:  CANDIDATE  walks into scene. The entire background remains frozen. )\n\
  CANDIDATE: ( Oozing gravitas. ) Unlike my opponent, I've pledged not to use your tax dollars to build giant golden statues of myself.\n\
  (CANDIDATE  walks over to still-frozen  GUNMAN 1  standing on the counter and jumps 12 feet in the air, delivering a spinning roundhouse kick\x97 Matrix -style\x97to  GUNMAN 1 's head, shattering it into a million pieces.  CANDIDATE  turns to address the camera. )\n\
  CANDIDATE: My name is [ insert your name here ], and I definitely approved this message.\n\
