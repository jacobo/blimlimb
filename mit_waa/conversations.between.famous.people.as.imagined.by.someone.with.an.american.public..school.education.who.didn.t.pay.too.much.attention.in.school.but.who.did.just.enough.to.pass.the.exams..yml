  Richard Nixon and Winston Churchill\n\
  NIXON: Hello, I see you're smoking a cigar and wearing a large hat.\n\
  CHURCHILL: So I am, young chap. Could I interest you in a cigar?\n\
  NIXON: Sure, I think I smoke cigars ... maybe ... I don't know.\n\
  (CHURCHILL  hands a cigar to  NIXON , who bites off the tip and lights it. )\n\
  NIXON: We were probably alive at the same time.\n\
  CHURCHILL: Indeed, my boy, indeed. I had something to do with World War II and I think maybe you fought  in it .\n\
  NIXON: I'm not sure if I did.\n\
  CHURCHILL: There's not that much more about me that everyone knows.\n\
  NIXON: I once held up my hands and formed two peace signs. I was either about to get onto a plane or get off of one.\n\
  CHURCHILL: I have seen the photo, because I think there were cameras when I was\n\
  alive.\n\
  NIXON: And what about Watergate? I did that.\n\
  CHURCHILL: Margaret Thatcher is someone else from England. She was leader after me.\n\
  NIXON: People can buy masks of my face.\n\
  J.D. Salinger and Christopher Columbus\n\
  COLUMBUS: I discovered America.\n\
  SALINGER: You're a phony, everything's phony.\n\
  COLUMBUS: I sailed on three ships called the  Ni\xF1a , the  Pinta , and the  Santa Maria . I don't think I had anything to do with the  Mayflower . That was before me.\n\
  SALINGER: Everything is phony.\n\
  COLUMBUS: It was 1492 when I found America. That year is definitely correct.\n\
  SALINGER: Were there Indians here when you got here?\n\
  COLUMBUS: Yes. I discovered them, too. I don't think I had Thanksgiving with them, though. Those were Pilgrims. Maybe I was a Pilgrim, but probably not.\n\
  SALINGER: I wrote one book and nobody ever saw me again.\n\
  COLUMBUS: There were no books when I was alive.\n\
  Abraham Lincoln and Hitler\n\
  HITLER: Kill the Jews.\n\
  ABE: Free the slaves.\n\
  HITLER: Kill everyone, especially the Jews. Nazis are the best.\n\
  ABE: Emancipation Proclamation.\n\
  HITLER:  Mein Kampf .\n\
  ABE: Four score and seven years ago.\n\
  HITLER: Kill all Jews!\n\
  ABE: I was shot in the head at a play, because the Civil War made people from the South angry.\n\
  HITLER: I created Nazis.\n\
