  Continuity:  While getting it on with Jon in his convertible, Jill's "Lil Devil" tattoo switches from her left buttock to her right buttock and back again several times.
  Revealing mistake:  Although the movie is about the sexual exploits of a small Northeastern university's football team and its eager-to-please cheerleaders, all the cars have California plates and the campus looks uncannily like Burbank Community College.
  Crew or equipment visible:  When the camera pans around during the orgy scene, you can see a fluffer doing Sudoku in the background.
  Factual error:  When Misty seduces Randy in the locker room, a play can be seen sketched out on the chalkboard behind them. But the play has too many men on the field at once, which would be an automatic 5-yard penalty.
  Continuity:  During the bubble-bath scene, Jenna and Misty work each other over with a dildo. In the long shots it's a 12-inch Throbzilla, but in the close-ups it's an 18-inch Throbzilla Ultra.
  Revealing mistake:  Not long after Jenna goes down on Randy at the beach house, through the window behind them you can see a police car pull into the driveway. The police are there to arrest the director of photography for mail fraud.
  Crew or equipment visible:  During the scene in the park, there's a brief glimpse of the wranglers whose job it is to keep Ron Jeremy from disrobing for any reason.
  Factual error:  When Jill shows up at Tom's dorm in a jersey and helmet, she claims to be "a very tight end." But the number on her jersey is 55, and football traditionally reserves numbers 50 through 59 for centers and linebackers. Either she's wearing the wrong jersey or she's not such a tight end after all.
  Continuity:  While being double-teamed by Jon and Tom in the planetarium, Amber loses a shoe. But when they flip her over, the missing shoe magically reappears on her foot.
  Revealing mistake:  Despite being an 18-year-old freshman straight from the farm, Randy wears a wedding ring in every scene  except  the panty-raid scene. That scene was a pickup done several months after principal photography wrapped, by which time the actor and his wife had separated.
  Crew or equipment visible:  When the girls are being chased through the haunted house by the disembodied penis, you can totally see the wires.
  Factual error:  During Randy and Amber's coupling under the bleachers, she screams, "Oh, baby, split the uprights!" But Randy is a quarterback, who would never be responsible for kicking. There are specialized players for that.
