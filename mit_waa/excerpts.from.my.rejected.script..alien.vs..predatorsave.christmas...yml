  INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP\n\
  (SANTA  oversees elves working hard to make toys. Nothing could possibly ruin this scene of Christmas magic. )\n\
  SANTA: Good work, everyone! Nothing could possibly ruin this scene of \n\
  Christmas magic.\n\
  ( Suddenly, the lights dim and everything shakes as a meteor streaks overhead! )\n\
  EXT. NIGHT THE NORTH POLE\x97LATER\n\
  ( Two  ELVES  approach a smoking crater.  RUFUS , a street-smart elf with \"urban\" flair, follows reluctantly. )\n\
  RUFUS: Yo, let's bounce. This ain't right.\n\
  ELF 1: But what if it's filled with candy?\n\
  ELF 2: Do you think it's weird we don't have names?\n\
  ( Suddenly, two  FACE-HUGGERS  leap out of the crater! )\n\
  ELVES 1 AND 2: Ahhh!\n\
  RUFUS: Aw, hell naw!\n\

  EXT. NIGHT THE CANDY CANE FOREST\n\
  ( A red glow shines in the near distance.  SANTA  approaches it. )\n\
  SANTA: Rudolph? Is that you?\n\
  (PREDATOR  decloaks, revealing the glow to be his targeting laser! )\n\
  SANTA: Gulp.\n\
  (PREDATOR  fires, hitting an  ALIEN  right behind  SANTA ! )\n\
  SANTA: Maybe I can put you on the \"Nice\" list after all.\n\
  PREDATOR: Thanks, Santa. Also, I talk now.\n\
  (SANTA  and  PREDATOR  shake hands. )\n\
  PREDATOR: Let's give these aliens what for.\n\
  (RUFUS  pops out from behind a candy cane. )\n\
  RUFUS: Damn, son! This shit just got real!\n\

  INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP\n\
  ( The workshop is now an alien nest.  SANTA ,  MRS. CLAUS , and  RUFUS  are cocooned to the wall. Alien eggs sit in front of them. Nearby,  PREDATOR  wrestles with the  ALIEN QUEEN ! )\n\
  SANTA: Hurry, Predator! There's not much time!\n\
  ( The  QUEEN 's got  PREDATOR  on the ropes, when\x97 BLAM !\x97the  ALIEN  explodes in a cloud of goo. A  SILHOUETTED FIGURE  enters the room holding a smoking plasma rifle. )\n\
  PREDATOR: Jesus! Took you long enough.\n\
  JESUS: Sorry. Traffic was a bitch.\n\
  (JESUS  throws a rifle to  PREDATOR . )\n\
  JESUS: You ready to party like it's my birthday?\n\
  PREDATOR: Is Christmas considered a deadweight loss under modern microeconomic theory?\n\
  ( The pair coolly cock their rifles. )\n\
  RUFUS: Now that's what I'm talking about!\n\
