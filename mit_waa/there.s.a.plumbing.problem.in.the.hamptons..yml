  Hi, this is Hilary Martin. My number's on file. Last month, I ordered a platinum custom-built shower unit, but you guys made a mistake the other day when you installed it. I went over all the specifications with you. I wanted all the fixtures made of highly polished platinum and the walls made of treated platinum. In a semicircular pattern along the bottom and top perimeters, I wanted alternating couplets of emeralds and rubies. My order wasn't that hard\x97just a basic platinum shower. But you guys messed up the installation. You gave me a golden shower. Please call me back so we can get this fixed.\n\

  Hi, this is Hilary Martin. I called yesterday about the golden shower you guys gave me. My number's on file. Look, I understand that this is a busy season for plumbers in the Hamptons: more 10-person hot tubs are installed this month than at any other time during the year. Believe me, I know. But I'd really like to get this golden shower fixed. Not only is it not what I ordered; it's not even working right. This morning, it started dripping warm water on my rug, changing its color, which matched my curtains perfectly. I expect you to reimburse me for dyeing my rug in addition to installing the correct and functioning shower. Please call me.\n\

  Hi, this is Hilary Martin. I called and left a couple of messages last week about the golden shower you guys gave me. I know I probably sounded kinda pissy both times, but I'm feeling a little better now. I'm warming up to the golden shower. I have to admit, I wanted the platinum shower because it screamed filthy rich, but having a golden shower as part of my morning routine is wonderful. It's warm, and the way it gets me wet is much more satisfying than any other shower I've had before. But it's still dripping all over my carpet. Please call me so we can fix this. My number's on file.\n\

  Hi, this is Hilary Martin. I just wanted to call and thank you again for the best golden shower in the world! I can't even describe how much I love it! I'm thinking about giving them as gifts\x97do you think you could help me? I want to get one for my sister's birthday, and maybe give one to my mother, because I've been telling her so much about it. You know what you should do? Offer them to all your clients! If you need a customer testimonial, I'd be happy to give one. How about \"Getting a golden shower is the cleanest thing I've done in years, and I want to share the experience with as many people as possible\"? Give me a call, let's talk.\n\
