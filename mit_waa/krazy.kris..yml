  January 1\n\
  ME: Listen, can't we talk about this some other time?\n\
  JEN: Some other time when? Our finances are a disaster! If we don't take care of this situation now, we're going to have to take out a second mortgage. So when do you plan\x97\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Did someone say mortgage? That reminds me of a joke. What did the man say to the\x97\n\
  JEN: Who in the hell is this?\n\
  ME: That's Krazy Kris! I hired him to provide comic relief! You know, for our relationship! For our lives!\n\
  JEN: Where did he come from?\n\
  ME: A special agency. For couples who are a little down. Anyway, look! He's taking off his shirt! He's popping his ample stomach in and out! Isn't this fantastic? Honey? Yes?\n\
  JEN: How is he supporting himself? What exactly are you paying him?\n\
  ME: Our 401(k). Relax, it's worth it.\n\
  JEN: Now he's performing somersaults on our living-room floor.\n\
  ME: This guy can do anything. Isn't he amazing?\n\
  March 3\n\
  JEN: I really don't know what to do about my mother. We should talk about assisted care versus independent care\x97\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Look at me, everybody! I'm making balloon animals!\n\
  JEN: For the love of ... He has to make an appearance every time we have a fight? How does he even know when to come over?\n\
  ME: I have him paged.\n\
  JEN: He's now playing a tuba and marching in step ... I can't hear myself think!\n\
  ME: Louder! Louder!\n\
  March 15\n\
  JEN: Are you aware that Krazy Kris is standing at the edge of our bed?\n\
  ME: I figured we needed to lighten things up a bit in the bedroom. Mind?\n\
  JEN: What's that standing next to him?\n\
  ME: What does it look like? It's a miniature donkey! Krazy Kris rented it for the night. Isn't it adorable!\n\
  JEN: We haven't made love in months!\n\
  ME: It's the  perfect  remedy to take our minds off our problem! Kris, make the donkey bray! Do it!\n\
  April 4\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Anyone up for some spin-art fun? Hey, where's your wife?\n\
  ME: At her brother's in Bethesda\x97she just moved out.\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: That's terrible. I'm sorry.\n\
  ME: It had absolutely nothing to do with you. Entertain me, Krazy ... I need it now more than ever.\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Bunny hop! Grab on tight, folks! We're goin' for a ride!\n\
  May 27\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Seen the TV remote?\n\
  ME: Aren't you going to amuse me?\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: How much can I amuse you already? Four hours isn't enough?\n\
  ME: When you first got here, you'd amuse me all day. How about a somersault?\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: With the day I've been having, no  thank  you. I don't know, maybe tomorrow?\n\
  Yesterday\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: I think my troubles first started in college. Women could never relate to me as anything more than a friend. Always the funny guy, you know?\n\
  ME: God, you're a bore. What's the matter with you lately?\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: I guess even clowns have their off months. Sue me. Life ain't all about the gags. Pass the remote.\n\
  Today\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Seen the heating pad? My back is on fire. Oh, I'm in such a mood!\n\
  ME: Krazy Kris, I think we need to talk.\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: About what? And, by the way, my real name's Christopher.\n\
  ME: I miss the juggling, the spontaneity, the animal tricks. It's not like it used to be.\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Welcome to life, big man.\n\
  ME: All I'm saying is that we need to have a little chat.\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Ha! Give me a break! Who are you\x97my father? Here we go again! Pick, pick, pick! Like a goddamn crow!\n\
  ME: Well, I am paying your rent! And your food! So, yes, maybe I am your father!\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Shut up!\n\
  ME: Excuse me? Who are you to talk to me like that? Who\x97\n\
  MR. PICKLES: Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!\n\
  KRAZY KRIS: Who in the hell is this? And why is he wearing a gigantic rainbow wig and playing the ukulele?\n\
  MR. PICKLES: They call me Mr. Pickles! C'mon, everybody! Dance! Dance! Dance your problems away!\n\
