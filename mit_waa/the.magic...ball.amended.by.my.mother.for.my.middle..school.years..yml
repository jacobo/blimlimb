  Very doubtful. But you brought that on yourself.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  As I see it, yes. But when was the last time you cared what I thought?\n\
  - - - -\n\
  My sources say yes. And they have no reason to lie about seeing you at the mall in the middle of a school day.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  It is decidedly so. I just know.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Outlook good. Let's see how long that lasts.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Outlook not so good. See?\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Better not tell you now. You seem upset and I'm afraid you might do something irrational. At least that's what  Time  magazine says about teenagers.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Signs point to yes. The incense, for one. How stupid do you think I am?\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Don't count on it. Or on much else if you keep going the way you're going.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Yes\x97definitely. Oh wait, I thought that was your sister holding the ball. For you, no.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Reply hazy. Try again when I'm off the phone with my boyfriend.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Concentrate and ask again. I can't abide poor grammar.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  My reply is no. Crying won't change things.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Ask again later. Maybe in 20 years, when you'll understand what you put me through.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  You may rely on it. Let's just hope \"it\" can rely on you, too. Poor \"it.\"\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Yes. As long as an adult is present and your grades are good. So I guess it's actually no.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Most likely. Especially if your friends are already doing it.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  Cannot predict now. But, if your past behavior is any indication, the results will include my picking you up at the police station at 4 a.m.\n\
  - - - -\n\
  It is certain. Everyone blames the mother.\n\
