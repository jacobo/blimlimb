  My mom\n\
  \x97 Hello. You have been chosen at random for a quick poll. It will just take a minute.\n\
  \x97 Do you currently have a position on the merits of full-time employment?\n\
  \x97 Yes, yes, most people concur. Would your position change, however, if you were to read the significant number of studies that have documented the hazards of full-time work on one's physical and mental health?\n\
  \x97 Yes, ma'am, that would definitely include one's desire and ability to produce grandchildren.\n\
  \x97 And would it also affect your views were you to learn that many bosses these days routinely and unfairly pick favorites at work?\n\
  \x97 Actually, no, your son would not be one of them.\n\
  \x97 And, finally, would hearing that your son was in fact recently \"promoted\" to a \"freelance position\" negatively or positively affect your views on whether he is, as you put it, \"amounting to anything\"?\n\
  \x97 I see.\n\
  \x97 Well, have you checked in with his sister recently? Seriously, her life's a mess.\n\
  The lady at Chase Visa\n\
  \x97 Are you or are you not aware that Mr. Dyckman recently spent $150 on a four-disc soft-rock compilation? Yes, that's right, the one featured in that infomercial with Air Supply.\n\
  \x97 Now, would you be more or less likely to omit that charge from Mr. Dyckman's monthly statement if you knew that Mr. Dyckman did not in fact mean to order that item?\n\
  \x97 Well, how would your opinion change if you were to learn that he isn't even a fan of Air Supply?\n\
  \x97 Oh, really? And how would your adherence to this \"Visa policy\" change if you found out that Mr. Dyckman was drunk at the time?\n\
  \x97 No, I mean  really  drunk.\n\
  \x97 Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, like you're some perfect saint.\n\
  My boss\n\
  \x97 Good afternoon, sir. If I could have just a few moments of your precious time.\n\
  \x97 If you were to discover the identity of the \"total douche\" who parked in your spot last week, would you be more or less likely to let it slide?\n\
  \x97 Noted. Now, would those feelings change if you were to learn that this individual would never have parked in your spot had all the handicapped spaces not been occupied?\n\
  \x97 Well, not that I think it matters, but let's say no, this person is not technically handicapped.\n\
  \x97 I see. Just one more thing. Would you be more or less likely to forget about such a minor transgression were you to hear that Stevenson in accounting is banging your wife?\n\
  \x97 Look, I'm just saying that's what the word on the street is.\n\
  My date\n\
  \x97 Hello. You have been selected at random to answer a few questions. I understand that on Friday night you have a date with that cute guy who works down the hall?\n\
  \x97 Ma'am, please, of course this is random.\n\
  \x97 Would you say that you would be more or less likely to sleep with Jay Dyckman if you knew that he once saved a sack of drowning kittens?\n\
  \x97 Uncertain. OK. Well, then, would your answer change if you learned that this act of heroism occurred while he was driving a bus of underprivileged children to a concert?\n\
  \x97 Uh ... a GWAR concert?\n\
  \x97 Whoops. Pardon my mistake. I see now the survey clearly reads that it was in fact a Miley Cyrus concert.\n\
  \x97 Excellent. Now, would your excitement to sleep with Jay Dyckman change if you were to overhear a vicious rumor, possibly from someone's bitter ex-roommate, that the underprivileged children could more accurately be described as exotic dancers?\n\
  \x97 And the kittens a bag of pot?\n\
  \x97 Oh. Yes, well, of course. And just one last question. Do you have any idea how your totally hot blond friend feels about rescued exotic dancers ... Hello?\n\
