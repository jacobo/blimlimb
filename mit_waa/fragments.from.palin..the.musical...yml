  ( Alaska governor  SARAH PALIN  is taking a rare afternoon off from work. She walks by a strip mall. Like all Alaskan strip malls, it contains a moose supply store, a pizza parlor, and a doctors' office. She stops to admire the moose-supply-store window and almost bumps into a  DOCTOR . )\n\
  DOCTOR\n\
  Hello. I'm an obstetrician.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Well, hello. I'm a politician.\n\
  DOCTOR\n\
  Good day, madam.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Good day, sir. \n\
  I'm not pregnant.\n\
  DOCTOR\n\
  Who said you were?\n\
  ( A few days later,  SARAH PALIN  returns to the doctors' office. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  I've been so busy \n\
  With governance \n\
  That I've neglected \n\
  To be inspected. \n\
  I'd like to have an exam now, please.\n\
  DOCTOR\n\
  Get on the table and raise your knees.\n\
  ( The  DOCTOR  determines that  SARAH PALIN  is pregnant. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Holy moly! \n\
  Sakes alive! \n\
  I have four kids. \n\
  This makes five.\n\
  ( A few months later,  SARAH PALIN  is at a conference. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  We need to make the country work \n\
  For ordinary folk. \n\
  Direct reform must be the norm, \n\
  And ... Oops, my water broke.\n\
  (SARAH PALIN  flies home to Alaska to have the baby. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  We'll call him Trig. \n\
  It means \"strength\" in Norse. \n\
  We'll care for him, raise him, \n\
  And love him, of course.\n\
  (SARAH PALIN  continues to govern the state, tend to her family, help her husband with his business, and find time for herself. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Take that, Murkowski! \n\
  It's dinnertime, kids! \n\
  Goodbye, Bridge to Nowhere! \n\
  Hello, dogsled skids! \n\
  Need haircut, need yoga! \n\
  Need food for the house! \n\
  Need to remember \n\
  To pick up that blouse! \n\
  Drill here, drill now! \n\
  No, not you, Todd! \n\
  An hour till hockey, \n\
  Then the Iditarod.\n\
  ( One afternoon,  SARAH PALIN 's teenage daughter  BRISTOL PALIN  approaches her. )\n\
  BRISTOL PALIN\n\
  Mom, \n\
  We have to talk.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Come with me \n\
  While I walk. \n\
  The guys at work all call it \n\
  My morning constitutional. \n\
  That's what passes for a joke. \n\
  Politics is institutional.\n\
  BRISTOL PALIN\n\
  Mom, \n\
  I think I'm late.\n\
  (SARAH PALIN 's phone rings. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  One second. \n\
  In this state, \n\
  Where ethical breaches \n\
  And pork-filled bills are legion, \n\
  We need a real reformer \n\
  To rectify the region.\n\
  BRISTOL PALIN\n\
  Mom, \n\
  I need you now.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  My schedule \n\
  Won't allow \n\
  A heart-to-heart till Thursday.\n\
  BRISTOL PALIN\n\
  Mom, listen, I'm pregnant!\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Well, now I'm  boulevers\xE9e . \n\
  I think of you as a child still, a \n\
  Tomboy on the loose in Wasilla, \n\
  Though I see that you are a woman now. \n\
  We have to fix this soon. But how?\n\
  (SARAH PALIN  visits her daughter's boyfriend,  LEVI JOHNSTON . As she approaches him, she hears him bragging to his friends. )\n\
  LEVI JOHNSTON\n\
  I shot, I scored. \n\
  The puck is in the goal. \n\
  I shot, I scored. \n\
  We didn't practice birth control, \n\
  Or gun control, for that matter. \n\
  Easy-Bake Oven, meet baby batter. \n\
  I may have mixed a metaphor, \n\
  But what do I care? \n\
  I shoot, I score!\n\
  (SARAH PALIN  clears her throat.  LEVI JOHNSTON  turns to see the governor standing beside him. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  I hunt with a shotgun, \n\
  Not a musket or pistol. \n\
  I'm holding one now. \n\
  Will you marry my Bristol?\n\
  LEVI JOHNSTON\n\
  I'm an effing redneck, ma'am. \n\
  It says so on my MySpace page. \n\
  I'm not sure I can marry her, \n\
  Because, well, we're both underage.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  You two can marry. \n\
  We'll have a wedding. \n\
  Otherwise, it'll be \n\
  You I'm beheading. \n\
  I'll come down on you like an atom bomb.\n\
  LEVI JOHNSTON\n\
  Well, uh, I mean, can I call you Mom?\n\
  ( Across the country,  JOHN McCAIN  is meeting with  CHARLIE BLACK  and  RICK DAVIS  to decide whom to pick for vice president. )\n\
  JOHN McCAIN\n\
  I think I want \n\
  Joe Lieberman.\n\
  CHARLIE BLACK\n\
  With him, there's no way \n\
  You can win.\n\
  JOHN McCAIN\n\
  Well, what about Tom Ridge instead?\n\
  CHARLIE BLACK\n\
  Do that and your campaign is dead.\n\
  RICK DAVIS\n\
  We need a conservative who can serve.\n\
  JOHN McCAIN\n\
  You jerks are getting on my last nerve.\n\
  ( The phone rings in the Palin home. )\n\
  TODD PALIN\n\
  Sarah, phone. \n\
  It's John McCain.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  The guy from  Die Hard ? \n\
  I love that movie.\n\
  TODD PALIN\n\
  No, the senator.\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Oh, OK. Groovy.\n\
  (JOHN McCAIN  offers her a spot on the Republican ticket. )\n\
  JOHN McCAIN\n\
  Is there anything \n\
  I need to know \n\
  About your family?\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  No. Although, \n\
  Now that you mention it, \n\
  Once, back in the '80s, \n\
  Todd was driving tipsy \n\
  And dinged up a Mercedes.\n\
  JOHN McCAIN\n\
  You sure \n\
  That's all?\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  That's all \n\
  I recall.\n\
  JOHN McCAIN\n\
  That's really \n\
  Quite small. \n\
  Excellent. You've got the job. \n\
  Rick and Charlie can polish my knob.\n\
  (McCAIN  picks her. Though the Obama campaign does not criticize  SARAH PALIN  directly, they dispatch an army of winged, fanged  DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES  to do so. )\n\
  DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 1\n\
  How can she \n\
  Care for her infant son \n\
  And also help \n\
  The country run?\n\
  DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 2\n\
  The baby's not hers. \n\
  It belongs to her daughter. \n\
  The water that broke \n\
  Wasn't really her water.\n\
  DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 3\n\
  She's like a spy \n\
  Working in our midst, \n\
  A hot one who is \n\
  A separatist.\n\
  DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE 4\n\
  The University \n\
  Of Idaho? \n\
  Where is that, even? \n\
  I don't know.\n\
  (SARAH PALIN  issues a folksy response. )\n\
  SARAH PALIN\n\
  Come on, that's just not fair of you. \n\
  I'm going to hunt caribou. \n\
  Then I'll go for stag. Then I'll go for bear. \n\
  Corrupt politicians should also beware. \n\
  I'm locked. I'm loaded. \n\
  D.C.'s outmoded. \n\
  The old way's dying. \n\
  The underlying \n\
  Causes are too great to number. \n\
  For starters, power makes you dumber. \n\
  It tends to encumber the heart and the spirit. \n\
  Silence your inner voice until you can't hear it. \n\
  That's what's happening, you see, \n\
  To the Democratic nominee. \n\
  I won't do that. Don't forget \n\
  I auctioned off a private jet. \n\
  I'll listen to myself. \n\
  I'll listen to my Lord. \n\
  I'll listen to my family. \n\
  And we will be restored.\n\
  (JOHN McCAIN , moved by her straight talk and her reformer's instinct, steps down from the ticket. The Supreme Court, also moved, permits it. Her opponents in the election,  BARACK OBAMA  and  JOE BIDEN , find themselves overcome with emotion as well; Biden cries so hard that his hair plugs pop out of his head. On Election Day, 100 percent of female voters cast ballots for  SARAH PALIN , who is elected in a landslide.  SARAH PALIN  presides over two terms of peace and prosperity, during which time she and Todd have five more children: Haley, Window, Gossamer, Shemp, and John. )\n\
