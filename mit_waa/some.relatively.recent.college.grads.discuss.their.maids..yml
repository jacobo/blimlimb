  Subject: maid service?\n\
  Hi, List! I hope everyone is well. I am writing to see if anyone has a recommendation for a good maid service in the West Village. My roommates and I have high-paying jobs and booming social lives that keep us out most of the time, but when we do happen to be home, we need it to be clean! And we don't want to do it ourselves.\n\
  Thanks in advance! \n\

  Hi, Cara. Didn't we roofie each other once when you were a freshman? You have brown hair, right? With honey highlights? I use an excellent maid company that services the Upper East Side. However, I am sure that if you paid more money someone would make the trip down to the Village. What sort of things are you looking to have cleaned? I have found my girl to be particularly helpful in cleaning my subwoofers, my leather couch, and the rest of my enormous apartment with wraparound view. Let me know if you would like her phone number (or mine).\n\
  Bulldogs forever. \n\

  Hi, Bulldogs!\n\
  Arf arf arf!!\n\
  I have the best maid! I love her so much. She is really cute!! She is short and sweet and smells like Pine-Sol. She is particularly good at cleaning bathrooms. She is funny, too! She is always giggling and is so so so super-sweet! I make such big messes when I cook and she is soooooooo good at cleaning them up! She is really sweet. I love her. I want to eat her! Chomp chomp chomp. Arf arf arf!\n\
  I am not sure whether or not she has a name. But if you give me your address, Cara, I can put her in a cab and direct the cab driver to drive to that address.\n\
  On another note: Does anyone know how to go about getting advance tickets for the game against Oxley? Lemme know!\n\
  Love and bulldogs, arf!!\n\
  xoxo \n\

  Hi, everyone. Kathryn, you can get tickets for the game against Oxley by going to the alumni website and clicking on \"Tickets: Game Against Oxley.\" That will take you to a site where you can purchase tickets for the game. Let me know if you have any trouble.\n\
  Also, Bulldogs, please remember Annual Giving. It doesn't matter how much you give; it can be $5 or $5,000. Participation is what is key. Remember that your gift amounts will be engraved and displayed on a gigantic plaque at the entrance to the John H. Sununu Gymnasium. The plaque alone will cost $18,000.\n\
  As for maids, you can get them for a dime a dozen if you hit Canal Street anytime after 2:30 on a weekday. Let me know if you have any trouble.\n\
  Thanks, everyone.\n\
  Best, \n\

  hey, does anyone know of a maid who specializes in vomit? our loft is covered in some oxley dude's vomit and has been since sunday morning. it is now thursday. our entire loft smells like leftover vomit and it is unclear to me and my roommates where to get disinfectant spray or some shit like that. our moms are coming to visit this weekend and we would like to have the vomit taken care of by then. if anyone has any extra maids, please just send them over.\n\
  also, we are having a party on saturday. all are welcome. 437 first ave., apt. 3. starting around midnight. if you vomit we will scalp you.\n\

  Subject: Ty's party / maids\n\
  Hey, Tyler\x97can't wait for the party. Amazing!\n\
  I have 14 maids. I graduated two years ago and have a lot of things that need cleaning. I would be happy to recommend any of my maids. They are from all over the world and speak tiny bits of English. This is nice because if you are sitting in your apartment and you're pissed off, the last thing you want to do is make small talk with your maid. Luckily, small talk is close to impossible with a maid who hardly speaks English.\n\
  I haven't received my Christmas traveling dates from my stepmom yet, but as soon as she e-mails my flight info and itinerary, I will be sure to let you all know what days my maids will have off. Hope everyone is having a good holiday season.\n\
  See most of you Saturday.\n\
  Hugs, \n\
  Steph\n\

  Kathryn, please do not use the alumni listserv for personal communications.\n\
  I have lived in the city for over 50 years now and have plenty of good maids to recommend. I have found that most of them will work for little to no pay, if that is of any consequence to you. My wife died 48 years ago, and my maids are often my only comfort here in this deceptively bustling city.\n\
  So raise your voice \n\
  And sing out loud, \n\
  Join your hearts, \n\
  Make Bulldogs proud. \n\
  Boom boom boom rah!\n\

  Greetings, Bulldogs. This is slightly off-topic, but does anyone understand public transportation in the city? I am trying to get from the Upper West Side to Chelsea and I have been staring at a map for over an hour now. Has anyone ridden the underground subway train or taken the city bus before? I am near tears.\n\

  Jessica: Do not take public transportation. That is exactly how my wife died. Forty-eight years ago next week.\n\
  So take our hands \n\
  And lift our eyes \n\
  Till Bulldog Heaven \n\
  Is our prize.  \n\
  Sis sis sis boom!\n\

  Good morning, Bulldogs. I have a very good maid who comes every other week and charges a reasonable rate. If anyone is interested in her, just shoot me an e-mail.\n\
  I have been out of college only since June and have already made $95,000.\n\

  Hi, Daniel. How on earth are you making that much money? Ever since my wife died, it has been very difficult for me to make any money. Please help an old Bulldog out.\n\
  So grab a glass \n\
  And raise it high.  \n\
  The Bulldog in us \n\
  Will not die. \n\
  Rah rah rah hey!\n\

  Thank you to everyone for all your help! My roommates and I will actually be transferred to the Shanghai office next month, so it looks like we don't need a maid after all. However, if anyone has any insight as to whether there is still indentured servitude in China, please let us know.\n\
  Go, fight, win,  BULLDOGS ! \n\
